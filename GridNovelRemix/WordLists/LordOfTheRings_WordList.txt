foreword

this
tale
grew
in
the
telling
until
it
became
a
history
of
the
great
war
of
the
ring
and
included
many
glimpses
of
the
yet
more
ancient
history
that
preceded
it
it
was
begun
soon
after

the
hobbit

was
written
and
before
its
publication
in
1937
but
I
did
not
go
on
with
this
sequel
for
I
wished
first
to
complete
and
set
in
order
the
mythology
and
legends
of
the
elder
days
which
had
then
been
taking
shape
for
some
years
I
desired
to
do
this
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
I
had
little
hope
that
other
people
would
be
interested
in
this
work
especially
since
it
was
primarily
linguistic
in
inspiration
and
was
begun
in
order
to
provide
the
necessary
background
of
'history'
for
elvish
tongues


when
those
whose
advice
and
opinion
I
sought
corrected

little
hope

to

no
hope

I
went
back
to
the
sequel
encouraged
by
requests
from
readers
for
more
information
concerning
hobbits
and
their
adventures
but
the
story
was
drawn
irresistibly
towards
the
older
world
and
became
an
account
as
it
were
of
its
end
and
passing
away
before
its
beginning
and
middle
had
been
told
the
process
had
begun
in
the
writing
of

the
hobbit

in
which
there
were
already
some
references
to
the
older
matter
elrond
gondolin
the
highelves
and
the
orcs
as
well
as
glimpses
that
had
arisen
unbidden
of
things
higher
or
deeper
or
darker
than
its
surface
durin
moria
gandalf
the
necromancer
the
ring
the
discovery
of
the
significance
of
these
glimpses
and
of
their
relation
to
the
ancient
histories
revealed
the
third
age
and
its
culmination
in
the
war
of
the
ring

those
who
had
asked
for
more
information
about
hobbits
eventually
got
it
but
they
had
to
wait
a
long
time
for
the
composition
of

the
lord
of
the
rings

went
on
at
intervals
during
the
years
1936
to
1949
a
period
in
which
I
had
many
duties
that
I
did
not
neglect
and
many
other
interests
as
a
learner
and
teacher
that
often
absorbed
me
the
delay
was
of
course
also
increased
by
the
outbreak
of
war
in
1939
by
the
end
of
which
year
the
tale
had
not
yet
reached
the
end
of
book
one
in
spite
of
the
darkness
of
the
next
five
years
I
found
that
the
story
could
not
now
be
wholly
abandoned
and
I
plodded
on
mostly
by
night
till
I
stood
by
balin's
tomb
in
moria
there
I
halted
for
a
long
while
it
was
almost
a
year
later
when
I
went
on
and
so
came
to
lothlrien
and
the
great
river
late
in
1941
in
the
next
year
I
wrote
the
first
drafts
of
the
matter
that
now
stands
as
book
three
and
the
beginnings
of
chapters
I
and
iii
of
book
five
and
there
as
the
beacons
flared
in
anrien
and
thoden
came
to
harrowdale
I
stopped
foresight
had
failed
and
there
was
no
time
for
thought

it
was
during
1944
that
leaving
the
loose
ends
and
perplexities
of
a
war
which
it
was
my
task
to
conduct
or
at
least
to
report
1
forced
myself
to
tackle
the
journey
of
frodo
to
mordor
these
chapters
eventually
to
become
book
four
were
written
and
sent
out
as
a
serial
to
my
son
christopher
then
in
south
africa
with
the
raf
nonetheless
it
took
another
five
years
before
the
tale
was
brought
to
its
present
end
in
that
time
I
changed
my
house
my
chair
and
my
college
and
the
days
though
less
dark
were
no
less
laborious
then
when
the
'end'
had
at
last
been
reached
the
whole
story
had
to
be
revised
and
indeed
largely
rewritten
backwards
and
it
had
to
be
typed
and
retyped
by
me
the
cost
of
professional
typing
by
the
tenfingered
was
beyond
my
means


the
lord
of
the
rings

has
been
read
by
many
people
since
it
finally
appeared
in
print
and
I
should
like
to
say
something
here
with
reference
to
the
many
opinions
or
guesses
that
I
have
received
or
have
read
concerning
the
motives
and
meaning
of
the
tale
the
prime
motive
was
the
desire
of
a
taleteller
to
try
his
hand
at
a
really
long
story
that
would
hold
the
attention
of
readers
amuse
them
delight
them
and
at
times
maybe
excite
them
or
deeply
move
them
as
a
guide
I
had
only
my
own
feelings
for
what
is
appealing
or
moving
and
for
many
the
guide
was
inevitably
often
at
fault
some
who
have
read
the
book
or
at
any
rate
have
reviewed
it
have
found
it
boring
absurd
or
contemptible
and
I
have
no
cause
to
complain
since
I
have
similar
opinions
of
their
works
or
of
the
kinds
of
writing
that
they
evidently
prefer
but
even
from
the
points
of
view
of
many
who
have
enjoyed
my
story
there
is
much
that
fails
to
please
it
is
perhaps
not
possible
in
a
long
tale
to
please
everybody
at
all
points
nor
to
displease
everybody
at
the
same
points
for
I
find
from
the
letters
that
I
have
received
that
the
passages
or
chapters
that
are
to
some
a
blemish
are
all
by
others
specially
approved
the
most
critical
reader
of
all
myself
now
finds
many
defects
minor
and
major
but
being
fortunately
under
no
obligation
either
to
review
the
book
or
to
write
it
again
he
will
pass
over
these
in
silence
except
one
that
has
been
noted
by
others
the
book
is
too
short

as
for
any
inner
meaning
or
'message'
it
has
in
the
intention
of
the
author
none
it
is
neither
allegorical
nor
topical
as
the
story
grew
it
put
down
roots
into
the
past
and
threw
out
unexpected
branches
but
its
main
theme
was
settled
from
the
outset
by
the
inevitable
choice
of
the
ring
as
the
link
between
it
and

the
hobbit

the
crucial
chapter
the
shadow
of
the
past'
is
one
of
the
oldest
parts
of
the
tale
it
was
written
long
before
the
foreshadow
of
1939
had
yet
become
a
threat
of
inevitable
disaster
and
from
that
point
the
story
would
have
developed
along
essentially
the
same
lines
if
that
disaster
had
been
averted
its
sources
are
things
long
before
in
mind
or
in
some
cases
already
written
and
little
or
nothing
in
it
was
modified
by
the
war
that
began
in
1939
or
its
sequels

the
real
war
does
not
resemble
the
legendary
war
in
its
process
or
its
conclusion
if
it
had
inspired
or
directed
the
development
of
the
legend
then
certainly
the
ring
would
have
been
seized
and
used
against
sauron
he
would
not
have
been
annihilated
but
enslaved
and
baraddr
would
not
have
been
destroyed
but
occupied
saruman
failing
to
get
possession
of
the
ring
would
m
the
confusion
and
treacheries
of
the
time
have
found
in
mordor
the
missing
links
in
his
own
researches
into
ringlore
and
before
long
he
would
have
made
a
great
ring
of
his
own
with
which
to
challenge
the
selfstyled
ruler
of
middleearth
in
that
conflict
both
sides
would
have
held
hobbits
in
hatred
and
contempt
they
would
not
long
have
survived
even
as
slaves

other
arrangements
could
be
devised
according
to
the
tastes
or
views
of
those
who
like
allegory
or
topical
reference
but
I
cordially
dislike
allegory
in
all
its
manifestations
and
always
have
done
so
since
I
grew
old
and
wary
enough
to
detect
its
presence
I
much
prefer
history
true
or
feigned
with
its
varied
applicability
to
the
thought
and
experience
of
readers
I
think
that
many
confuse
'applicability'
with
'allegory'
but
the
one
resides
in
the
freedom
of
the
reader
and
the
other
in
the
purposed
domination
of
the
author

an
author
cannot
of
course
remain
wholly
unaffected
by
his
experience
but
the
ways
in
which
a
storygerm
uses
the
soil
of
experience
are
extremely
complex
and
attempts
to
define
the
process
are
at
best
guesses
from
evidence
that
is
inadequate
and
ambiguous
it
is
also
false
though
naturally
attractive
when
the
lives
of
an
author
and
critic
have
overlapped
to
suppose
that
the
movements
of
thought
or
the
events
of
times
common
to
both
were
necessarily
the
most
powerful
influences
one
has
indeed
personally
to
come
under
the
shadow
of
war
to
feel
fully
its
oppression
but
as
the
years
go
by
it
seems
now
often
forgotten
that
to
be
caught
in
youth
by
1914
was
no
less
hideous
an
experience
than
to
be
involved
in
1939
and
the
following
years
by
1918
all
but
one
of
my
close
friends
were
dead
or
to
take
a
less
grievous
matter
it
has
been
supposed
by
some
that
'the
scouring
of
the
shire'
reflects
the
situation
in
england
at
the
time
when
I
was
finishing
my
tale
it
does
not
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
plot
foreseen
from
the
outset
though
in
the
event
modified
by
the
character
of
saruman
as
developed
in
the
story
without
need
I
say
any
allegorical
significance
or
contemporary
political
reference
whatsoever
it
has
indeed
some
basis
in
experience
though
slender
for
the
economic
situation
was
entirely
different
and
much
further
back
the
country
in
which
I
lived
in
childhood
was
being
shabbily
destroyed
before
I
was
ten
in
days
when
motorcars
were
rare
objects
I
had
never
seen
one
and
men
were
still
building
suburban
railways
recently
I
saw
in
a
paper
a
picture
of
the
last
decrepitude
of
the
once
thriving
cornmill
beside
its
pool
that
long
ago
seemed
to
me
so
important
I
never
liked
the
looks
of
the
young
miller
but
his
father
the
old
miller
had
a
black
beard
and
he
was
not
named
sandyman


the
lord
of
the
rings

is
now
issued
in
a
new
edition
and
the
opportunity
has
been
taken
of
revising
it
a
number
of
errors
and
inconsistencies
that
still
remained
in
the
text
have
been
corrected
and
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
provide
information
on
a
few
points
which
attentive
readers
have
raised
I
have
considered
all
their
comments
and
enquiries
and
if
some
seem
to
have
been
passed
over
that
may
be
because
I
have
failed
to
keep
my
notes
in
order
but
many
enquiries
could
only
be
answered
by
additional
appendices
or
indeed
by
the
production
of
an
accessory
volume
containing
much
of
the
material
that
I
did
not
include
in
the
original
edition
in
particular
more
detailed
linguistic
information
in
the
meantime
this
edition
offers
this
foreword
an
addition
to
the
prologue
some
notes
and
an
index
of
the
names
of
persons
and
places
this
index
is
in
intention
complete
in
items
but
not
in
references
since
for
the
present
purpose
it
has
been
necessary
to
reduce
its
bulk
a
complete
index
making
full
use
of
the
material
prepared
for
me
by
mrs
n
smith
belongs
rather
to
the
accessory
volume


prologue


this
book
is
largely
concerned
with
hobbits
and
from
its
pages
a
reader
may
discover
much
of
their
character
and
a
little
of
their
history
further
information
will
also
be
found
in
the
selection
from
the
red
book
of
westmarch
that
has
already
been
published
under
the
title
of

the
hobbit

that
story
was
derived
from
the
earlier
chapters
of
the
red
book
composed
by
bilbo
himself
the
first
hobbit
to
become
famous
in
the
world
at
large
and
called
by
him

there
and
back
again

since
they
told
of
his
journey
into
the
east
and
his
return
an
adventure
which
later
involved
all
the
hobbits
in
the
great
events
of
that
age
that
are
here
related

many
however
may
wish
to
know
more
about
this
remarkable
people
from
the
outset
while
some
may
not
possess
the
earlier
book
for
such
readers
a
few
notes
on
the
more
important
points
are
here
collected
from
hobbitlore
and
the
first
adventure
is
briefly
recalled

hobbits
are
an
unobtrusive
but
very
ancient
people
more
numerous
formerly
than
they
are
today
for
they
love
peace
and
quiet
and
good
tilled
earth
a
wellordered
and
wellfarmed
countryside
was
their
favourite
haunt
they
do
not
and
did
not
understand
or
like
machines
more
complicated
than
a
forgebellows
a
watermill
or
a
handloom
though
they
were
skilful
with
tools
even
in
ancient
days
they
were
as
a
rule
shy
of
'the
big
folk'
as
they
call
us
and
now
they
avoid
us
with
dismay
and
are
becoming
hard
to
find
they
are
quick
of
hearing
and
sharpeyed
and
though
they
are
inclined
to
be
fat
and
do
not
hurry
unnecessarily
they
are
nonetheless
nimble
and
deft
in
their
movements
they
possessed
from
the
first
the
art
of
disappearing
swiftly
and
silently
when
large
folk
whom
they
do
not
wish
to
meet
come
blundering
by
and
this
an
they
have
developed
until
to
men
it
may
seem
magical
but
hobbits
have
never
in
fact
studied
magic
of
any
kind
and
their
elusiveness
is
due
solely
to
a
professional
skill
that
heredity
and
practice
and
a
close
friendship
with
the
earth
have
rendered
inimitable
by
bigger
and
clumsier
races

for
they
are
a
little
people
smaller
than
dwarves
less
tout
and
stocky
that
is
even
when
they
are
not
actually
much
shorter
their
height
is
variable
ranging
between
two
and
four
feet
of
our
measure
they
seldom
now
reach
three
feet
but
they
hive
dwindled
they
say
and
in
ancient
days
they
were
taller
according
to
the
red
book
bandobras
took
bullroarer
son
of
isengrim
the
second
was
four
foot
five
and
able
to
ride
a
horse
he
was
surpassed
in
all
hobbit
records
only
by
two
famous
characters
of
old
but
that
curious
matter
is
dealt
with
in
this
book

as
for
the
hobbits
of
the
shire
with
whom
these
tales
are
concerned
in
the
days
of
their
peace
and
prosperity
they
were
a
merry
folk
they
dressed
in
bright
colours
being
notably
fond
of
yellow
and
green
but
they
seldom
wore
shoes
since
their
feet
had
tough
leathery
soles
and
were
clad
in
a
thick
curling
hair
much
like
the
hair
of
their
heads
which
was
commonly
brown
thus
the
only
craft
little
practised
among
them
was
shoemaking
but
they
had
long
and
skilful
fingers
and
could
make
many
other
useful
and
comely
things
their
faces
were
as
a
rule
goodnatured
rather
than
beautiful
broad
brighteyed
redcheeked
with
mouths
apt
to
laughter
and
to
eating
and
drinking
and
laugh
they
did
and
eat
and
drink
often
and
heartily
being
fond
of
simple
jests
at
all
times
and
of
six
meals
a
day
when
they
could
get
them
they
were
hospitable
and
delighted
in
parties
and
in
presents
which
they
gave
away
freely
and
eagerly
accepted

it
is
plain
indeed
that
in
spite
of
later
estrangement
hobbits
are
relatives
of
ours
far
nearer
to
us
than
elves
or
even
than
dwarves
of
old
they
spoke
the
languages
of
men
after
their
own
fashion
and
liked
and
disliked
much
the
same
things
as
men
did
but
what
exactly
our
relationship
is
can
no
longer
be
discovered
the
beginning
of
hobbits
lies
far
back
in
the
elder
days
that
are
now
lost
and
forgotten
only
the
elves
still
preserve
any
records
of
that
vanished
time
and
their
traditions
are
concerned
almost
entirely
with
their
own
history
in
which
men
appear
seldom
and
hobbits
are
not
mentioned
at
all
yet
it
is
clear
that
hobbits
had
in
fact
lived
quietly
in
middleearth
for
many
long
years
before
other
folk
became
even
aware
of
them
and
the
world
being
after
all
full
of
strange
creatures
beyond
count
these
little
people
seemed
of
very
little
importance
but
in
the
days
of
bilbo
and
of
frodo
his
heir
they
suddenly
became
by
no
wish
of
their
own
both
important
and
renowned
and
troubled
the
counsels
of
the
wise
and
the
great

those
days
the
third
age
of
middleearth
are
now
long
past
and
the
shape
of
all
lands
has
been
changed
but
the
regions
in
which
hobbits
then
lived
were
doubtless
the
same
as
those
in
which
they
still
linger
the
northwest
of
the
old
world
east
of
the
sea
of
their
original
home
the
hobbits
in
bilbo's
time
preserved
no
knowledge
a
love
of
learning
other
than
genealogical
lore
was
far
from
general
among
them
but
there
remained
still
a
few
in
the
older
families
who
studied
their
own
books
and
even
gathered
reports
of
old
times
and
distant
lands
from
elves
dwarves
and
men
their
own
records
began
only
after
the
settlement
of
the
shire
and
their
most
ancient
legends
hardly
looked
further
back
than
their
wandering
days
it
is
clear
nonetheless
from
these
legends
and
from
the
evidence
of
their
peculiar
words
and
customs
that
like
many
other
folk
hobbits
had
in
the
distant
past
moved
westward
their
earliest
tales
seem
to
glimpse
a
time
when
they
dwelt
in
the
upper
vales
of
anduin
between
the
eaves
of
greenwood
the
great
and
the
misty
mountains
why
they
later
undertook
the
hard
and
perilous
crossing
of
the
mountains
into
eriador
is
no
longer
certain
their
own
accounts
speak
of
the
multiplying
of
men
in
the
land
and
of
a
shadow
that
fell
on
the
forest
so
that
it
became
darkened
and
its
new
name
was
mirkwood

before
the
crossing
of
the
mountains
the
hobbits
had
already
become
divided
into
three
somewhat
different
breeds
harfoots
stoors
and
fallohides
the
harfoots
were
browner
of
skin
smaller
and
shorter
and
they
were
beardless
and
bootless
their
hands
and
feet
were
neat
and
nimble
and
they
preferred
highlands
and
hillsides
the
stoors
were
broader
heavier
in
build
their
feet
and
hands
were
larger
and
they
preferred
flat
lands
and
riversides
the
fallohides
were
fairer
of
skin
and
also
of
hair
and
they
were
taller
and
slimmer
than
the
others
they
were
lovers
of
trees
and
of
woodlands

the
harfoots
had
much
to
do
with
dwarves
in
ancient
times
and
long
lived
in
the
foothills
of
the
mountains
they
moved
westward
early
and
roamed
over
eriador
as
far
as
weathertop
while
the
others
were
still
in
the
wilderland
they
were
the
most
normal
and
representative
variety
of
hobbit
and
far
the
most
numerous
they
were
the
most
inclined
to
settle
in
one
place
and
longest
preserved
their
ancestral
habit
of
living
in
tunnels
and
holes

the
stoors
lingered
long
by
the
banks
of
the
great
river
anduin
and
were
less
shy
of
men
they
came
west
after
the
harfoots
and
followed
the
course
of
the
loudwater
southwards
and
there
many
of
them
long
dwelt
between
tharbad
and
the
borders
of
dunland
before
they
moved
north
again

the
fallohides
the
least
numerous
were
a
northerly
branch
they
were
more
friendly
with
elves
than
the
other
hobbits
were
and
had
more
skill
in
language
and
song
than
in
handicrafts
and
of
old
they
preferred
hunting
to
tilling
they
crossed
the
mountains
north
of
rivendell
and
came
down
the
river
hoarwell
in
eriador
they
soon
mingled
with
the
other
kinds
that
had
preceded
them
but
being
somewhat
bolder
and
more
adventurous
they
were
often
found
as
leaders
or
chieftains
among
clans
of
harfoots
or
stoors
even
in
bilbo's
time
the
strong
fallohidish
strain
could
still
be
noted
among
the
greater
families
such
as
the
tooks
and
the
masters
of
buckland

in
the
westlands
of
eriador
between
the
misty
mountains
and
the
mountains
of
lune
the
hobbits
found
both
men
and
elves
indeed
a
remnant
still
dwelt
there
of
the
dnedain
the
kings
of
men
that
came
over
the
sea
out
of
westernesse
but
they
were
dwindling
fast
and
the
lands
of
their
north
kingdom
were
falling
far
and
wide
into
waste
there
was
room
and
to
spare
for
incomers
and
ere
long
the
hobbits
began
to
settle
in
ordered
communities
most
of
their
earlier
settlements
had
long
disappeared
and
been
forgotten
in
bilbo's
time
but
one
of
the
first
to
become
important
still
endured
though
reduced
in
size
this
was
at
bree
and
in
the
chetwood
that
lay
round
about
some
forty
miles
east
of
the
shire


it
was
in
these
early
days
doubtless
that
the
hobbits
learned
their
letters
and
began
to
write
after
the
manner
of
the
dnedain
who
had
in
their
turn
long
before
learned
the
art
from
the
elves
and
in
those
days
also
they
forgot
whatever
languages
they
had
used
before
and
spoke
ever
after
the
common
speech
the
westron
as
it
was
named
that
was
current
through
all
the
lands
of
the
kings
from
arnor
to
gondor
and
about
all
the
coasts
of
the
sea
from
belfalas
to
lune
yet
they
kept
a
few
words
of
their
own
as
well
as
their
own
names
of
months
and
days
and
a
great
store
of
personal
names
out
of
the
past

about
this
time
legend
among
the
hobbits
first
becomes
history
with
a
reckoning
of
years
for
it
was
in
the
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
first
year
of
the
third
age
that
the
fallohide
brothers
marcho
and
blanco
set
out
from
bree
and
having
obtained
permission
from
the
high
king
at
fornost
they
crossed
the
brown
river
baranduin
with
a
great
following
of
hobbits
they
passed
over
the
bridge
of
stonebows
that
had
been
built
in
the
days
of
the
power
of
the
north
kingdom
and
they
took
ail
the
land
beyond
to
dwell
in
between
the
river
and
the
far
downs
all
that
was
demanded
of
them
was
that
they
should
keep
the
great
bridge
in
repair
and
all
other
bridges
and
roads
speed
the
king's
messengers
and
acknowledge
his
lordship

thus
began
the

shirereckoning

for
the
year
of
the
crossing
of
the
brandywine
as
the
hobbits
turned
the
name
became
year
one
of
the
shire
and
all
later
dates
were
reckoned
from
it
at
once
the
western
hobbits
fell
in
love
with
their
new
land
and
they
remained
there
and
soon
passed
once
more
out
of
the
history
of
men
and
of
elves
while
there
was
still
a
king
they
were
in
name
his
subjects
but
they
were
in
fact
ruled
by
their
own
chieftains
and
meddled
not
at
all
with
events
in
the
world
outside
to
the
last
battle
at
fornost
with
the
witchlord
of
angmar
they
sent
some
bowmen
to
the
aid
of
the
king
or
so
they
maintained
though
no
tales
of
men
record
it
but
in
that
war
the
north
kingdom
ended
and
then
the
hobbits
took
the
land
for
their
own
and
they
chose
from
their
own
chiefs
a
thain
to
hold
the
authority
of
the
king
that
was
gone
there
for
a
thousand
years
they
were
little
troubled
by
wars
and
they
prospered
and
multiplied
after
the
dark
plague
sr
37
until
the
disaster
of
the
long
winter
and
the
famine
that
followed
it
many
thousands
then
perished
but
the
days
of
dearth
115860
were
at
the
time
of
this
tale
long
past
and
the
hobbits
had
again
become
accustomed
to
plenty
the
land
was
rich
and
kindly
and
though
it
had
long
been
deserted
when
they
entered
it
it
had
before
been
well
tilled
and
there
the
king
had
once
had
many
farms
cornlands
vineyards
and
woods

forty
leagues
it
stretched
from
the
far
downs
to
the
brandywine
bridge
and
fifty
from
the
northern
moors
to
the
marshes
in
the
south
the
hobbits
named
it
the
shire
as
the
region
of
the
authority
of
their
thain
and
a
district
of
wellordered
business
and
there
in
that
pleasant
comer
of
the
world
they
plied
their
wellordered
business
of
living
and
they
heeded
less
and
less
the
world
outside
where
dark
things
moved
until
they
came
to
think
that
peace
and
plenty
were
the
rule
in
middleearth
and
the
right
of
all
sensible
folk
they
forgot
or
ignored
what
little
they
had
ever
known
of
the
guardians
and
of
the
labours
of
those
that
made
possible
the
long
peace
of
the
shire
they
were
in
fact
sheltered
but
they
had
ceased
to
remember
it

at
no
time
had
hobbits
of
any
kind
been
warlike
and
they
had
never
fought
among
themselves
in
olden
days
they
had
of
course
been
often
obliged
to
fight
to
maintain
themselves
in
a
hard
world
but
in
bilbo's
time
that
was
very
ancient
history
the
last
battle
before
this
story
opens
and
indeed
the
only
one
that
had
ever
been
fought
within
the
borders
of
the
shire
was
beyond
living
memory
the
battle
of
greenfields
sr
1147
in
which
bandobras
took
routed
an
invasion
of
orcs
even
the
weathers
had
grown
milder
and
the
wolves
that
had
once
come
ravening
out
of
the
north
in
bitter
white
winters
were
now
only
a
grandfather's
tale
so
though
there
was
still
some
store
of
weapons
in
the
shire
these
were
used
mostly
as
trophies
hanging
above
hearths
or
on
walls
or
gathered
into
the
museum
at
michel
delving
the
mathomhouse
it
was
called
for
anything
that
hobbits
had
no
immediate
use
for
but
were
unwilling
to
throw
away
they
called
a

mathom

their
dwellings
were
apt
to
become
rather
crowded
with
mathoms
and
many
of
the
presents
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
were
of
that
son


nonetheless
ease
and
peace
had
left
this
people
still
curiously
tough
they
were
if
it
came
to
it
difficult
to
daunt
or
to
kill
and
they
were
perhaps
so
unwearyingly
fond
of
good
things
not
least
because
they
could
when
put
to
it
do
without
them
and
could
survive
rough
handling
by
grief
foe
or
weather
in
a
way
that
astonished
those
who
did
not
know
them
well
and
looked
no
further
than
their
bellies
and
their
wellfed
faces
though
slow
to
quarrel
and
for
sport
killing
nothing
that
lived
they
were
doughty
at
bay
and
at
need
could
still
handle
arms
they
shot
well
with
the
bow
for
they
were
keeneyed
and
sure
at
the
mark
not
only
with
bows
and
arrows
if
any
hobbit
stooped
for
a
stone
it
was
well
to
get
quickly
under
cover
as
all
trespassing
beasts
knew
very
well

all
hobbits
had
originally
lived
in
holes
in
the
ground
or
so
they
believed
and
in
such
dwellings
they
still
felt
most
at
home
but
in
the
course
of
time
they
had
been
obliged
to
adopt
other
forms
of
abode
actually
in
the
shire
in
bilbo's
days
it
was
as
a
rule
only
the
richest
and
the
poorest
hobbits
that
maintained
the
old
custom
the
poorest
went
on
living
in
burrows
of
the
most
primitive
kind
mere
holes
indeed
with
only
one
window
or
none
while
the
welltodo
still
constructed
more
luxurious
versions
of
the
simple
diggings
of
old
but
suitable
sites
for
these
large
and
ramifying
tunnels
or

smials

as
they
called
them
were
not
everywhere
to
be
found
and
in
the
flats
and
the
lowlying
districts
the
hobbits
as
they
multiplied
began
to
build
above
ground
indeed
even
in
the
hilly
regions
and
the
older
villages
such
as
hobbiton
or
tuckborough
or
in
the
chief
township
of
the
shire
michel
delving
on
the
white
downs
there
were
now
many
houses
of
wood
brick
or
stone
these
were
specially
favoured
by
millers
smiths
ropers
and
cartwrights
and
others
of
that
sort
for
even
when
they
had
holes
to
live
in
hobbits
had
long
been
accustomed
to
build
sheds
and
workshops

the
habit
of
building
farmhouses
and
barns
was
said
to
have
begun
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
marish
down
by
the
brandywine
the
hobbits
of
that
quarter
the
eastfarthing
were
rather
large
and
heavylegged
and
they
wore
dwarfboots
in
muddy
weather
but
they
were
well
known
to
be
stoors
in
a
large
part
of
their
blood
as
indeed
was
shown
by
the
down
that
many
grew
on
their
chins
no
harfoot
or
fallohide
had
any
trace
of
a
beard
indeed
the
folk
of
the
marish
and
of
buckland
east
of
the
river
which
they
afterwards
occupied
came
for
the
most
part
later
into
the
shire
up
from
southaway
and
they
still
had
many
peculiar
names
and
strange
words
not
found
elsewhere
in
the
shire

it
is
probable
that
the
craft
of
building
as
many
other
crafts
beside
was
derived
from
the
dnedain
but
the
hobbits
may
have
learned
it
direct
from
the
elves
the
teachers
of
men
in
their
youth
for
the
elves
of
the
high
kindred
had
not
yet
forsaken
middleearth
and
they
dwelt
still
at
that
time
at
the
grey
havens
away
to
the
west
and
in
other
places
within
reach
of
the
shire
three
elftowers
of
immemorial
age
were
still
to
be
seen
on
the
tower
hills
beyond
the
western
marches
they
shone
far
off
in
the
moonlight
the
tallest
was
furthest
away
standing
alone
upon
a
green
mound
the
hobbits
of
the
westfarthing
said
that
one
could
see
the
sea
from
the
lop
of
that
tower
but
no
hobbit
had
ever
been
known
to
climb
it
indeed
few
hobbits
had
ever
seen
or
sailed
upon
the
sea
and
fewer
still
had
ever
returned
to
report
it
most
hobbits
regarded
even
rivers
and
small
boats
with
deep
misgivings
and
not
many
of
them
could
swim
and
as
the
days
of
the
shire
lengthened
they
spoke
less
and
less
with
the
elves
and
grew
afraid
of
them
and
distrustful
of
those
that
had
dealings
with
them
and
the
sea
became
a
word
of
fear
among
them
and
a
token
of
death
and
they
turned
their
faces
away
from
the
hills
in
the
west

the
craft
of
building
may
have
come
from
elves
or
men
but
the
hobbits
used
it
in
their
own
fashion
they
did
not
go
in
for
towers
their
houses
were
usually
long
low
and
comfortable
the
oldest
kind
were
indeed
no
more
than
built
imitations
of

smials

thatched
with
dry
grass
or
straw
or
roofed
with
turves
and
having
walls
somewhat
bulged
that
stage
however
belonged
to
the
early
days
of
the
shire
and
hobbitbuilding
had
long
since
been
altered
improved
by
devices
learned
from
dwarves
or
discovered
by
themselves
a
preference
for
round
windows
and
even
round
doors
was
the
chief
remaining
peculiarity
of
hobbitarchitecture


the
houses
and
the
holes
of
shirehobbits
were
often
large
and
inhabited
by
large
families
bilbo
and
frodo
baggins
were
as
bachelors
very
exceptional
as
they
were
also
in
many
other
ways
such
as
their
friendship
with
the
elves
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
the
tooks
of
great
smials
or
the
brandybucks
of
brandy
hall
many
generations
of
relatives
lived
in
comparative
peace
together
in
one
ancestral
and
manytunnelled
mansion
all
hobbits
were
in
any
case
clannish
and
reckoned
up
their
relationships
with
great
care
they
drew
long
and
elaborate
familytrees
with
innumerable
branches
in
dealing
with
hobbits
it
is
important
to
remember
who
is
related
to
whom
and
in
what
degree
it
would
be
impossible
in
this
book
to
set
out
a
familytree
that
included
even
the
more
important
members
of
the
more
important
families
at
the
time
which
these
tales
tell
of
the
genealogical
trees
at
the
end
of
the
red
book
of
westmarch
are
a
small
book
in
themselves
and
all
but
hobbits
would
find
them
exceedingly
dull
hobbits
delighted
in
such
things
if
they
were
accurate
they
liked
to
have
books
filled
with
things
that
they
already
knew
set
out
fair
and
square
with
no
contradictions

there
is
another
astonishing
thing
about
hobbits
of
old
that
must
be
mentioned
an
astonishing
habit
they
imbibed
or
inhaled
through
pipes
of
clay
or
wood
the
smoke
of
the
burning
leaves
of
a
herb
which
they
called

pipeweed

or

leaf

a
variety
probably
of

nicotiana

a
great
deal
of
mystery
surrounds
the
origin
of
this
peculiar
custom
or
'art'
as
the
hobbits
preferred
to
call
it
all
that
could
be
discovered
about
it
in
antiquity
was
put
together
by
meriadoc
brandybuck
later
master
of
buckland
and
since
he
and
the
tobacco
of
the
southfarthing
play
a
part
in
the
history
that
follows
his
remarks
in
the
introduction
to
his

herblore
of
the
shire

may
be
quoted

'this'
he
says
'is
the
one
art
that
we
can
certainly
claim
to
be
our
own
invention
when
hobbits
first
began
to
smoke
is
not
known
all
the
legends
and
family
histories
take
it
for
granted
for
ages
folk
in
the
shire
smoked
various
herbs
some
fouler
some
sweeter
but
all
accounts
agree
that
tobold
hornblower
of
longbottom
in
the
southfarthing
first
grew
the
true
pipeweed
in
his
gardens
in
the
days
of
isengrim
the
second
about
the
year
1070
of
shirereckoning
the
best
homegrown
still
comes
from
that
district
especially
the
varieties
now
known
as
longbottom
leaf
old
toby
and
southern
star

'how
old
toby
came
by
the
plant
is
not
recorded
for
to
his
dying
day
he
would
not
tell
he
knew
much
about
herbs
but
he
was
no
traveller
it
is
said
that
in
his
youth
he
went
often
to
bree
though
he
certainly
never
went
further
from
the
shire
than
that
it
is
thus
quite
possible
that
he
learned
of
this
plant
in
bree
where
now
at
any
rate
it
grows
well
on
the
south
slopes
of
the
hill
the
breehobbits
claim
to
have
been
the
first
actual
smokers
of
the
pipeweed
they
claim
of
course
to
have
done
everything
before
the
people
of
the
shire
whom
they
refer
to
as
colonists
but
in
this
case
their
claim
is
I
think
likely
to
be
true
and
certainly
it
was
from
bree
that
the
art
of
smoking
the
genuine
weed
spread
in
the
recent
centuries
among
dwarves
and
such
other
folk
rangers
wizards
or
wanderers
as
still
passed
to
and
fro
through
that
ancient
roadmeeting
the
home
and
centre
of
the
an

thus
to
be
found
in
the
old
inn
of
bree

the
prancing
pony

that
has
been
kept
by
the
family
of
butterbur
from
time
beyond
record

'all
the
same
observations
that
I
have
made
on
my
own
many
journeys
south
have
convinced
me
that
the
weed
itself
is
not
native
to
our
parts
of
the
world
but
came
northward
from
the
lower
anduin
whither
it
was
I
suspect
originally
brought
over
sea
by
the
men
of
westernesse
it
grows
abundantly
in
gondor
and
there
is
richer
and
larger
than
in
the
north
where
it
is
never
found
wild
and
flourishes
only
in
warm
sheltered
places
like
longbottom
the
men
of
gondor
call
it

sweet
galenas

and
esteem
it
only
for
the
fragrance
of
its
flowers
from
that
land
it
must
have
been
carried
up
the
greenway
during
the
long
centuries
between
the
coming
of
elendil
and
our
own
day

but
even
the
dnedain
of
gondor
allow
us
this
credit
hobbits
first
put
it
into
pipes
not
even
the
wizards
first
thought
of
that
before
we
did
though
one
wizard
that
I
knew
took
up
the
art
long
ago
and
became
as
skilful
in
it
as
in
all
other
things
that
he
put
his
mind
to'

the
shire
was
divided
into
four
quarters
the
farthings
already
referred
to
north
south
east
and
west
and
these
again
each
into
a
number
of
folklands
which
still
bore
the
names
of
some
of
the
old
leading
families
although
by
the
time
of
this
history
these
names
were
no
longer
found
only
in
their
proper
folklands
nearly
all
tooks
still
lived
in
the
tookland
but
that
was
not
true
of
many
other
families
such
as
the
bagginses
or
the
boffins
outside
the
farthings
were
the
east
and
west
marches
the
buckland
see
beginning
of
chapter
v
book
I
and
the
westmarch
added
to
the
shire
in
sr
1462

the
shire
at
this
time
had
hardly
any
'government'
families
for
the
most
part
managed
their
own
affairs
growing
food
and
eating
it
occupied
most
of
their
time
in
other
matters
they
were
as
a
rule
generous
and
not
greedy
but
contented
and
moderate
so
that
estates
farms
workshops
and
small
trades
tended
to
remain
unchanged
for
generations

there
remained
of
course
the
ancient
tradition
concerning
the
high
king
at
fornost
or
norbury
as
they
called
it
away
north
of
the
shire
but
there
had
been
no
king
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
and
even
the
ruins
of
kings'
norbury
were
covered
with
grass
yet
the
hobbits
still
said
of
wild
folk
and
wicked
things
such
as
trolls
that
they
had
not
heard
of
the
king
for
they
attributed
to
the
king
of
old
all
their
essential
laws
and
usually
they
kept
the
laws
of
free
will
because
they
were
the
rules
as
they
said
both
ancient
and
just

it
is
true
that
the
took
family
had
long
been
preeminent
for
the
office
of
thain
had
passed
to
them
from
the
oldbucks
some
centuries
before
and
the
chief
took
had
borne
that
title
ever
since
the
thain
was
the
master
of
the
shiremoot
and
captain
of
the
shiremuster
and
the
hobbitryinarms
but
as
muster
and
moot
were
only
held
in
times
of
emergency
which
no
longer
occurred
the
thainship
had
ceased
to
be
more
than
a
nominal
dignity
the
took
family
was
still
indeed
accorded
a
special
respect
for
it
remained
both
numerous
and
exceedingly
wealthy
and
was
liable
to
produce
in
every
generation
strong
characters
of
peculiar
habits
and
even
adventurous
temperament
the
latter
qualities
however
were
now
rather
tolerated
in
the
rich
than
generally
approved
the
custom
endured
nonetheless
of
referring
to
the
head
of
the
family
as
the
took
and
of
adding
to
his
name
if
required
a
number
such
as
isengrim
the
second
for
instance

the
only
real
official
in
the
shire
at
this
date
was
the
mayor
of
michel
delving
or
of
the
shire
who
was
elected
every
seven
years
at
the
free
fair
on
the
white
downs
at
the
lithe
that
is
at
midsummer
as
mayor
almost
his
only
duty
was
to
preside
at
banquets
given
on
the
shireholidays
which
occurred
at
frequent
intervals
but
the
offices
of
postmaster
and
first
shirriff
were
attached
to
the
mayoralty
so
that
he
managed
both
the
messenger
service
and
the
watch
these
were
the
only
shireservices
and
the
messengers
were
the
most
numerous
and
much
the
busier
of
the
two
by
no
means
all
hobbits
were
lettered
but
those
who
were
wrote
constantly
to
all
their
friends
and
a
selection
of
their
relations
who
lived
further
off
than
an
afternoon's
walk

the
shirriffs
was
the
name
that
the
hobbits
gave
to
their
police
or
the
nearest
equivalent
that
they
possessed
they
had
of
course
no
uniforms
such
things
being
quite
unknown
only
a
feather
in
their
caps
and
they
were
in
practice
rather
haywards
than
policemen
more
concerned
with
the
strayings
of
beasts
than
of
people
there
were
in
all
the
shire
only
twelve
of
them
three
in
each
farthing
for
inside
work
a
rather
larger
body
varying
at
need
was
employed
to
'beat
the
bounds'
and
to
see
that
outsiders
of
any
kind
great
or
small
did
not
make
themselves
a
nuisance

at
the
time
when
this
story
begins
the
bounders
as
they
were
called
had
been
greatly
increased
there
were
many
reports
and
complaints
of
strange
persons
and
creatures
prowling
about
the
borders
or
over
them
the
first
sign
that
all
was
not
quite
as
it
should
be
and
always
had
been
except
in
tales
and
legends
of
long
ago
few
heeded
the
sign
and
not
even
bilbo
yet
had
any
notion
of
what
it
portended
sixty
years
had
passed
since
he
set
out
on
his
memorable
journey
and
he
was
old
even
for
hobbits
who
reached
a
hundred
as
often
as
not
but
much
evidently
still
remained
of
the
considerable
wealth
that
he
had
brought
back
how
much
or
how
little
he
revealed
to
no
one
not
even
to
frodo
his
favourite
'nephew'
and
he
still
kept
secret
the
ring
that
he
bad
found

as
is
told
in
the
hobbit
there
came
one
day
to
bilbo's
door
the
great
wizard
gandalf
the
grey
and
thirteen
dwarves
with
him
none
other
indeed
than
thorin
oakenshield
descendant
of
kings
and
his
twelve
companions
in
exile
with
them
he
set
out
to
his
own
lasting
astonishment
on
a
morning
of
april
it
being
then
the
year
1341
shirereckoning
on
a
quest
of
great
treasure
the
dwarfhoards
of
the
kings
under
the
mountain
beneath
erebor
in
dale
far
off
in
the
east
the
quest
was
successful
and
the
dragon
that
guarded
the
hoard
was
destroyed
yet
though
before
all
was
won
the
battle
of
five
armies
was
fought
and
thorin
was
slain
and
many
deeds
of
renown
were
done
the
matter
would
scarcely
have
concerned
later
history
or
earned
more
than
a
note
in
the
long
annals
of
the
third
age
but
for
an
'accident'
by
the
way
the
party
was
assailed
by
orcs
in
a
high
pass
of
the
misty
mountains
as
they
went
towards
wilderland
and
so
it
happened
that
bilbo
was
lost
for
a
while
in
the
black
orcmines
deep
under
the
mountains
and
there
as
he
groped
in
vain
in
the
dark
he
put
his
hand
on
a
ring
lying
on
the
floor
of
a
tunnel
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
it
seemed
then
like
mere
luck

trying
to
find
his
way
out
bilbo
went
on
down
to
the
roots
of
the
mountains
until
he
could
go
no
further
at
the
bottom
of
the
tunnel
lay
a
cold
lake
far
from
the
light
and
on
an
island
of
rock
in
the
water
lived
gollum
he
was
a
loathsome
little
creature
he
paddled
a
small
boat
with
his
large
flat
feet
peering
with
pale
luminous
eyes
and
catching
blind
fish
with
his
long
fingers
and
eating
them
raw
he
ate
any
living
thing
even
orc
if
he
could
catch
it
and
strangle
it
without
a
struggle
he
possessed
a
secret
treasure
that
had
come
to
him
long
ages
ago
when
he
still
lived
in
the
light
a
ring
of
gold
that
made
its
wearer
invisible
it
was
the
one
thing
he
loved
his
'precious'
and
he
talked
to
it
even
when
it
was
not
with
him
for
he
kept
it
hidden
safe
in
a
hole
on
his
island
except
when
he
was
hunting
or
spying
on
the
ores
of
the
mines

maybe
he
would
have
attacked
bilbo
at
once
if
the
ring
had
been
on
him
when
they
met
but
it
was
not
and
the
hobbit
held
in
his
hand
an
elvish
knife
which
served
him
as
a
sword
so
to
gain
time
gollum
challenged
bilbo
to
the
riddlegame
saying
that
if
he
asked
a
riddle
which
bilbo
could
not
guess
then
he
would
kill
him
and
eat
him
but
if
bilbo
defeated
him
then
he
would
do
as
bilbo
wished
he
would
lead
him
to
a
way
out
of
the
tunnels

since
he
was
lost
in
the
dark
without
hope
and
could
neither
go
on
nor
back
bilbo
accepted
the
challenge
and
they
asked
one
another
many
riddles
in
the
end
bilbo
won
the
game
more
by
luck
as
it
seemed
than
by
wits
for
he
was
stumped
at
last
for
a
riddle
to
ask
and
cried
out
as
his
hand
came
upon
the
ring
he
lad
picked
up
and
forgotten

what
haw
I
got
in
my
pocket

this
gollum
failed
to
answer
though
he
demanded
three
guesses

the
authorities
it
is
true
differ
whether
this
last
question
was
a
mere
'question'
and
not
a
'riddle'
according
to
the
strict
rules
of
the
game
but
all
agree
that
after
accepting
it
and
trying
to
guess
the
answer
gollum
was
bound
by
his
promise
and
bilbo
pressed
him
to
keep
his
word
for
the
thought
came
to
him
that
this
slimy
creature
might
prove
false
even
though
such
promises
were
held
sacred
and
of
old
all
but
the
wickedest
things
feared
to
break
them
but
after
ages
alone
in
the
dark
gollum's
heart
was
black
and
treachery
was
in
it
he
slipped
away
and
returned
to
the
island
of
which
bilbo
knew
nothing
not
far
off
in
the
dark
water
there
he
thought
lay
his
ring
he
was
hungry
now
and
angry
and
once
his
'precious'
was
with
him
he
would
not
fear
any
weapon
at
all

but
the
ring
was
not
on
the
island
he
had
lost
it
it
was
gone
his
screech
sent
a
shiver
down
bilbo's
back
though
he
did
not
yet
understand
what
had
happened
but
gollum
had
at
last
leaped
to
a
guess
too
late

what
has
it
got
in
its
pocketses

he
cried
the
light
in
his
eyes
was
like
a
green
flame
as
he
sped
back
to
murder
the
hobbit
and
recover
his
'precious'
just
in
time
bilbo
saw
his
peril
and
he
fled
blindly
up
the
passage
away
from
the
water
and
once
more
he
was
saved
by
his
luck
for
just
as
he
ran
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
the
ring
slipped
quietly
on
to
his
finger
so
it
was
that
gollum
passed
him
without
seeing
him
and
went
to
guard
the
way
out
lest
the
'thief'
should
escape
warily
bilbo
followed
him
as
he
went
along
cursing
and
talking
to
himself
about
his
'precious'
from
which
talk
at
last
even
bilbo
guessed
the
truth
and
hope
came
to
him
in
the
darkness
he
himself
had
found
the
marvellous
ring
and
a
chance
of
escape
from
the
orcs
and
from
gollum

at
length
they
came
to
a
halt
before
an
unseen
opening
that
led
to
the
lower
gates
of
the
mines
on
the
eastward
side
of
the
mountains
there
gollum
crouched
at
bay
smelling
and
listening
and
bilbo
was
tempted
to
slay
him
with
his
sword
but
pity
stayed
him
and
though
he
kept
the
ring
in
which
his
only
hope
lay
he
would
not
use
it
to
help
him
kill
the
wretched
creature
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
end
gathering
his
courage
he
leaped
over
gollum
in
the
dark
and
fled
away
down
the
passage
pursued
by
his
enemy's
cries
of
hate
and
despair

thief
thief
baggins
we
hates
it
for
ever


now
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
this
is
not
the
story
as
bilbo
first
told
it
to
his
companions
to
them
his
account
was
that
gollum
had
promised
to
give
him
a

present

if
he
won
the
game
but
when
gollum
went
to
fetch
it
from
his
island
he
found
the
treasure
was
gone
a
magic
ring
which
had
been
given
to
him
long
ago
on
his
birthday
bilbo
guessed
that
this
was
the
very
ring
that
he
had
found
and
as
he
had
won
the
game
it
was
already
his
by
right
but
being
in
a
tight
place
he
said
nothing
about
it
and
made
gollum
show
him
the
way
out
as
a
reward
instead
of
a
present
this
account
bilbo
set
down
in
his
memoirs
and
he
seems
never
to
have
altered
it
himself
not
even
after
the
council
of
elrond
evidently
it
still
appeared
in
the
original
red
book
as
it
did
in
several
of
the
copies
and
abstracts
but
many
copies
contain
the
true
account
as
an
alternative
derived
no
doubt
from
notes
by
frodo
or
samwise
both
of
whom
learned
the
truth
though
they
seem
to
have
been
unwilling
to
delete
anything
actually
written
by
the
old
hobbit
himself

gandalf
however
disbelieved
bilbo's
first
story
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
and
he
continued
to
be
very
curious
about
the
ring
eventually
he
got
the
true
tale
out
of
bilbo
after
much
questioning
which
for
a
while
strained
their
friendship
but
the
wizard
seemed
to
think
the
truth
important
though
he
did
not
say
so
to
bilbo
he
also
thought
it
important
and
disturbing
to
find
that
the
good
hobbit
had
not
told
the
truth
from
the
first
quite
contrary
to
his
habit
the
idea
of
a
'present'
was
not
mere
hobbitlike
invention
all
the
same
it
was
suggested
to
bilbo
as
he
confessed
by
gollum's
talk
that
he
overheard
for
gollum
did
in
fact
call
the
ring
his
'birthday
present'
many
times
that
also
gandalf
thought
strange
and
suspicious
but
he
did
not
discover
the
truth
in
this
point
for
many
more
years
as
will
be
seen
in
this
book

of
bilbo's
later
adventures
little
more
need
be
said
here
with
the
help
of
the
ring
he
escaped
from
the
orcguards
at
the
gate
and
rejoined
his
companions
he
used
the
ring
many
times
on
his
quest
chiefly
for
the
help
of
his
friends
but
he
kept
it
secret
from
them
as
long
as
he
could
after
his
return
to
his
home
he
never
spoke
of
it
again
to
anyone
save
gandalf
and
frodo
and
no
one
else
in
the
shire
knew
of
its
existence
or
so
he
believed
only
to
frodo
did
he
show
the
account
of
his
journey
that
he
was
writing

his
sword
sting
bilbo
hung
over
his
fireplace
and
his
coat
of
marvellous
mail
the
gift
of
the
dwarves
from
the
dragonhoard
he
lent
to
a
museum
to
the
michel
delving
mathomhouse
in
fact
but
he
kept
in
a
drawer
at
bag
end
the
old
cloak
and
hood
that
he
had
worn
on
his
travels
and
the
ring
secured
by
a
fine
chain
remained
in
his
pocket

he
returned
to
his
home
at
bag
end
on
june
the
22nd
in
his
fiftysecond
year
sr
1342
and
nothing
very
notable
occurred
in
the
shire
until
mr
baggins
began
the
preparations
for
the
celebration
of
his
hundredandeleventh
birthday
sr
1401
at
this
point
this
history
begins


at
the
end
of
the
third
age
the
part
played
by
the
hobbits
in
the
great
events
that
led
to
the
inclusion
of
the
shire
in
the
reunited
kingdom
awakened
among
them
a
more
widespread
interest
in
their
own
history
and
many
of
their
traditions
up
to
that
time
still
mainly
oral
were
collected
and
written
down
the
greater
families
were
also
concerned
with
events
in
the
kingdom
at
large
and
many
of
their
members
studied
its
ancient
histories
and
legends
by
the
end
of
the
first
century
of
the
fourth
age
there
were
already
to
be
found
in
the
shire
several
libraries
that
contained
many
historical
books
and
records

the
largest
of
these
collections
were
probably
at
undertowers
at
great
smials
and
at
brandy
hall
this
account
of
the
end
of
the
third
age
is
drawn
mainly
from
the
red
book
of
westmarch
that
most
important
source
for
the
history
of
the
war
of
the
ring
was
so
called
because
it
was
long
preserved
at
undertowers
the
home
of
the
fairbairns
wardens
of
the
westmarch
it
was
in
origin
bilbo's
private
diary
which
he
took
with
him
to
rivendell
frodo
brought
it
back
to
the
shire
together
with
many
loose
leaves
of
notes
and
during
sr
14201
he
nearly
filled
its
pages
with
his
account
of
the
war
but
annexed
to
it
and
preserved
with
it
probably
m
a
single
red
case
were
the
three
large
volumes
bound
in
red
leather
that
bilbo
gave
to
him
as
a
parting
gift
to
these
four
volumes
there
was
added
in
westmarch
a
fifth
containing
commentaries
genealogies
and
various
other
matter
concerning
the
hobbit
members
of
the
fellowship

the
original
red
book
has
not
been
preserved
but
many
copies
were
made
especially
of
the
first
volume
for
the
use
of
the
descendants
of
the
children
of
master
samwise
the
most
important
copy
however
has
a
different
history
it
was
kept
at
great
smials
but
it
was
written
in
condor
probably
at
the
request
of
the
greatgrandson
of
peregrin
and
completed
in
sr
1592
fa
172
its
southern
scribe
appended
this
note
findegil
king's
writer
finished
this
work
in
iv
172
it
is
an
exact
copy
in
all
details
of
the
thain's
book
m
minas
tirith
that
book
was
a
copy
made
at
the
request
of
king
elessar
of
the
red
book
of
the
periannath
and
was
brought
to
him
by
the
thain
peregrin
when
he
retired
to
gondor
in
iv
64

the
thain's
book
was
thus
the
first
copy
made
of
the
red
book
and
contained
much
that
was
later
omitted
or
lost
in
minas
tirith
it
received
much
annotation
and
many
corrections
especially
of
names
words
and
quotations
in
the
elvish
languages
and
there
was
added
to
it
an
abbreviated
version
of
those
parts
of

the
tale
of
aragorn
and
arwen

which
lie
outside
the
account
of
the
war
the
full
tale
is
stated
to
have
been
written
by
barahir
grandson
of
the
steward
faramir
some
time
after
the
passing
of
the
king
but
the
chief
importance
of
findegil's
copy
is
that
it
alone
contains
the
whole
of
bilbo's
'translations
from
the
elvish'
these
three
volumes
were
found
to
be
a
work
of
great
skill
and
learning
in
which
between
1403
and
1418
he
had
used
all
the
sources
available
to
him
in
rivendell
both
living
and
written
but
since
they
were
little
used
by
frodo
being
almost
entirely
concerned
with
the
elder
days
no
more
is
said
of
them
here

since
meriadoc
and
peregrin
became
the
heads
of
their
great
families
and
at
the
same
time
kept
up
their
connexions
with
rohan
and
gondor
the
libraries
at
bucklebury
and
tuckborough
contained
much
that
did
not
appear
in
the
red
book
in
brandy
hall
there
were
many
works
dealing
with
eriador
and
the
history
of
rohan
some
of
these
were
composed
or
begun
by
meriadoc
himself
though
in
the
shire
he
was
chiefly
remembered
for
his

herblore
of
the
shire

and
for
his

reckoning
of
years

m
which
he
discussed
the
relation
of
the
calendars
of
the
shire
and
bree
to
those
of
rivendell
gondor
and
rohan
he
also
wrote
a
short
treatise
on

old
words
and
names
in
the
shire

having
special
interest
in
discovering
the
kinship
with
the
language
of
the
rohirrim
of
such
'shirewords'
as

mathom

and
old
elements
in
place
names

at
great
smials
the
books
were
of
less
interest
to
shirefolk
though
more
important
for
larger
history
none
of
them
was
written
by
peregrin
but
he
and
his
successors
collected
many
manuscripts
written
by
scribes
of
gondor
mainly
copies
or
summaries
of
histories
or
legends
relating
to
elendil
and
his
heirs
only
here
in
the
shire
were
to
be
found
extensive
materials
for
the
history
of
nmenor
and
the
arising
of
sauron
it
was
probably
at
great
smials
that

the
tale
of
years

was
put
together
with
the
assistance
of
material
collected
by
meriadoc
though
the
dates
given
are
often
conjectural
especially
for
the
second
age
they
deserve
attention
it
is
probable
that
meriadoc
obtained
assistance
and
information
from
rivendell
which
he
visited
more
than
once
there
though
elrond
had
departed
his
sons
long
remained
together
with
some
of
the
highelven
folk
it
is
said
that
celeborn
went
to
dwell
there
after
the
departure
of
galadriel
but
there
is
no
record
of
the
day
when
at
last
he
sought
the

a
longexpected
party


when
mr
bilbo
baggins
of
bag
end
announced
that
he
would
shortly
be
celebrating
his
eleventyfirst
birthday
with
a
party
of
special
magnificence
there
was
much
talk
and
excitement
in
hobbiton

bilbo
was
very
rich
and
very
peculiar
and
had
been
the
wonder
of
the
shire
for
sixty
years
ever
since
his
remarkable
disappearance
and
unexpected
return
the
riches
he
had
brought
back
from
his
travels
had
now
become
a
local
legend
and
it
was
popularly
believed
whatever
the
old
folk
might
say
that
the
hill
at
bag
end
was
full
of
tunnels
stuffed
with
treasure
and
if
that
was
not
enough
for
fame
there
was
also
his
prolonged
vigour
to
marvel
at
time
wore
on
but
it
seemed
to
have
little
effect
on
mr
baggins
at
ninety
he
was
much
the
same
as
at
fifty
at
ninetynine
they
began
to
call
him

well
preserved
but

unchanged

would
have
been
nearer
the
mark
there
were
some
that
shook
their
heads
and
thought
this
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
it
seemed
unfair
that
anyone
should
possess
apparently
perpetual
youth
as
well
as
reputedly
inexhaustible
wealth

'it
will
have
to
be
paid
for'
they
said
'it
isn't
natural
and
trouble
will
come
of
it'

but
so
far
trouble
had
not
come
and
as
mr
baggins
was
generous
with
his
money
most
people
were
willing
to
forgive
him
his
oddities
and
his
good
fortune
he
remained
on
visiting
terms
with
his
relatives
except
of
course
the
sackvillebagginses
and
he
had
many
devoted
admirers
among
the
hobbits
of
poor
and
unimportant
families
but
he
had
no
close
friends
until
some
of
his
younger
cousins
began
to
grow
up

the
eldest
of
these
and
bilbo's
favourite
was
young
frodo
baggins
when
bilbo
was
ninetynine
he
adopted
frodo
as
his
heir
and
brought
him
to
live
at
bag
end
and
the
hopes
of
the
sackvillebagginses
were
finally
dashed
bilbo
and
frodo
happened
to
have
the
same
birthday
september
22nd
'you
had
better
come
and
live
here
frodo
my
lad'
said
bilbo
one
day
'and
then
we
can
celebrate
our
birthdayparties
comfortably
together'
at
that
time
frodo
was
still
in
his

tweens

as
the
hobbits
called
the
irresponsible
twenties
between
childhood
and
coming
of
age
at
thirtythree


twelve
more
years
passed
each
year
the
bagginses
had
given
very
lively
combined
birthdayparties
at
bag
end
but
now
it
was
understood
that
something
quite
exceptional
was
being
planned
for
that
autumn
bilbo
was
going
to
be

eleventyone

111
a
rather
curious
number
and
a
very
respectable
age
for
a
hobbit
the
old
took
himself
had
only
reached
130
and
frodo
was
going
to
be

thirtythree

33
an
important
number
the
date
of
his
'coming
of
age'

tongues
began
to
wag
in
hobbiton
and
bywater
and
rumour
of
the
coming
event
travelled
all
over
the
shire
the
history
and
character
of
mr
bilbo
baggins
became
once
again
the
chief
topic
of
conversation
and
the
older
folk
suddenly
found
their
reminiscences
in
welcome
demand

no
one
had
a
more
attentive
audience
than
old
ham
gamgee
commonly
known
as
the
gaffer
he
held
forth
at

the
ivy
bush

a
small
inn
on
the
bywater
road
and
he
spoke
with
some
authority
for
he
had
tended
the
garden
at
bag
end
for
forty
years
and
had
helped
old
holman
in
the
same
job
before
that
now
that
he
was
himself
growing
old
and
stiff
in
the
joints
the
job
was
mainly
carried
on
by
his
youngest
son
sam
gamgee
both
father
and
son
were
on
very
friendly
terms
with
bilbo
and
frodo
they
lived
on
the
hill
itself
in
number
3
bagshot
row
just
below
bag
end

'a
very
nice
wellspoken
gentlehobbit
is
mr
bilbo
as
i've
always
said'
the
gaffer
declared
with
perfect
truth
for
bilbo
was
very
polite
to
him
calling
him
'master
hamfast'
and
consulting
him
constantly
upon
the
growing
of
vegetables

in
the
matter
of
'roots'
especially
potatoes
the
gaffer
was
recognized
as
the
leading
authority
by
all
in
the
neighbourhood
including
himself

'but
what
about
this
frodo
that
lives
with
him'
asked
old
noakes
of
bywater
'baggins
is
his
name
but
he's
more
than
half
a
brandybuck
they
say
it
beats
me
why
any
baggins
of
hobbiton
should
go
looking
for
a
wife
away
there
in
buckland
where
folks
are
so
queer'

'and
no
wonder
they're
queer'
put
in
daddy
twofoot
the
gaffer's
nextdoor
neighbour
'if
they
live
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
brandywine
river
and
right
agin
the
old
forest
that's
a
dark
bad
place
if
half
the
tales
be
true'

'you're
right
dad'
said
the
gaffer
'not
that
the
brandybucks
of
buckland
live

in

the
old
forest
but
they're
a
queer
breed
seemingly
they
fool
about
with
boats
on
that
big
river

and
that
isn't
natural
small
wonder
that
trouble
came
of
it
I
say
but
be
that
as
it
may
mr
frodo
is
as
nice
a
young
hobbit
as
you
could
wish
to
meet
very
much
like
mr
bilbo
and
in
more
than
looks
after
all
his
father
was
a
baggins
a
decent
respectable
hobbit
was
mr
drogo
baggins
there
was
never
much
to
tell
of
him
till
he
was
drownded'

'drownded'
said
several
voices
they
had
heard
this
and
other
darker
rumours
before
of
course
but
hobbits
have
a
passion
for
family
history
and
they
were
ready
to
hear
it
again
'well
so
they
say'
said
the
gaffer
'you
see
mr
drogo
he
married
poor
miss
primula
brandybuck
she
was
our
mr
bilbo's
first
cousin
on
the
mother's
side
her
mother
being
the
youngest
of
the
old
took's
daughters
and
mr
drogo
was
his
second
cousin
so
mr
frodo
is
his
first

and

second
cousin
once
removed
either
way
as
the
saying
is
if
you
follow
me
and
mr
drogo
was
staying
at
brandy
hall
with
his
fatherinlaw
old
master
gorbadoc
as
he
often
did
after
his
marriage
him
being
partial
to
his
vittles
and
old
gorbadoc
keeping
a
mighty
generous
table
and
he
went
out

boating
on
the
brandywine
river
and
he
and
his
wife
were
drownded
and
poor
mr
frodo
only
a
child
and
all
'

'i've
heard
they
went
on
the
water
after
dinner
in
the
moonlight'
said
old
noakes
'and
it
was
drogo's
weight
as
sunk
the
boat'

'and

I

heard
she
pushed
him
in
and
he
pulled
her
in
after
him'
said
sandyman
the
hobbiton
miller

'you
shouldn't
listen
to
all
you
hear
sandyman'
said
the
gaffer
who
did
not
much
like
the
miller
'there
isn't
no
call
to
go
talking
of
pushing
and
pulling
boats
are
quite
tricky
enough
for
those
that
sit
still
without
looking
further
for
the
cause
of
trouble
anyway
there
was
this
mr
frodo
left
an
orphan
and
stranded
as
you
might
say
among
those
queer
bucklanders
being
brought
up
anyhow
in
brandy
hall
a
regular
warren
by
all
accounts
old
master
gorbadoc
never
had
fewer
than
a
couple
of
hundred
relations
in
the
place
mr
bilbo
never
did
a
kinder
deed
than
when
he
brought
the
lad
back
to
live
among
decent
folk

'but
I
reckon
it
was
a
nasty
shock
for
those
sackvillebagginses
they
thought
they
were
going
to
get
bag
end
that
time
when
he
went
off
and
was
thought
to
be
dead
and
then
he
comes
back
and
orders
them
off
and
he
goes
on
living
and
living
and
never
looking
a
day
older
bless
him
and
suddenly
he
produces
an
heir
and
has
all
the
papers
made
out
proper
the
sackvillebagginses
won't
never
see
the
inside
of
bag
end
now
or
it
is
to
be
hoped
not'

'there's
a
tidy
bit
of
money
tucked
away
up
there
I
hear
tell'
said
a
stranger
a
visitor
on
business
from
michel
delving
in
the
westfarthing
'all
the
top
of
your
hill
is
full
of
tunnels
packed
with
chests
of
gold
and
silver

and
jools
by
what
i've
heard
'

'then
you've
heard
more
than
I
can
speak
to'
answered
the
gaffer
I
know
nothing
about

jools

mr
bilbo
is
free
with
his
money
and
there
seems
no
lack
of
it
but
I
know
of
no
tunnelmaking
I
saw
mr
bilbo
when
he
came
back
a
matter
of
sixty
years
ago
when
I
was
a
lad
i'd
not
long
come
prentice
to
old
holman
him
being
my
dad's
cousin
but
he
had
me
up
at
bag
end
helping
him
to
keep
folks
from
trampling
and
trapessing
all
over
the
garden
while
the
sale
was
on
and
in
the
middle
of
it
all
mr
bilbo
comes
up
the
hill
with
a
pony
and
some
mighty
big
bags
and
a
couple
of
chests
I
don't
doubt
they
were
mostly
full
of
treasure
he
had
picked
up
in
foreign
parts
where
there
be
mountains
of
gold
they
say
but
there
wasn't
enough
to
fill
tunnels
but
my
lad
sam
will
know
more
about
that
he's
in
and
out
of
bag
end
crazy
about
stories
of
the
old
days
he
is
and
he
listens
to
all
mr
bilbo's
tales
mr
bilbo
has
learned
him
his
letters

meaning
no
harm
mark
you
and
I
hope
no
harm
will
come
of
it


'elves
and
dragons'

I
says
to
him
'
cabbages
and
potatoes
are
better
for
me
and
you
don't
go
getting
mixed
up
in
the
business
of
your
betters
or
you'll
land
in
trouble
too
big
for
you'
I
says
to
him
and
I
might
say
it
to
others'
he
added
with
a
look
at
the
stranger
and
the
miller

but
the
gaffer
did
not
convince
his
audience
the
legend
of
bilbo's
wealth
was
now
too
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
younger
generation
of
hobbits

'ah
but
he
has
likely
enough
been
adding
to
what
he
brought
at
first'
argued
the
miller
voicing
common
opinion
'he's
often
away
from
home
and
look
at
the
outlandish
folk
that
visit
him
dwarves
coming
at
night
and
that
old
wandering
conjuror
gandalf
and
all
you
can
say
what
you
like
gaffer
but
bag
end's
a
queer
place
and
its
folk
are
queerer'

'and
you
can
say

what
you

like
about
what
you
know
no
more
of
than
you
do
of
boating
mr
sandyman'
retorted
the
gaffer
disliking
the
miller
even
more
than
usual
if
that's
being
queer
then
we
could
do
with
a
bit
more
queerness
in
these
parts
there's
some
not
far
away
that
wouldn't
offer
a
pint
of
beer
to
a
friend
if
they
lived
in
a
hole
with
golden
walls
but
they
do
things
proper
at
bag
end
our
sam
says
that

everyone's

going
to
be
invited
to
the
party
and
there's
going
to
be
presents
mark
you
presents
for
all

this
very
month
as
is'

that
very
month
was
september
and
as
fine
as
you
could
ask
a
day
or
two
later
a
rumour
probably
started
by
the
knowledgeable
sam
was
spread
about
that
there
were
going
to
be
fireworks

fireworks
what
is
more
such
as
had
not
been
seen
in
the
shire
for
nigh
on
a
century
not
indeed
since
the
old
took
died

days
passed
and
the
day
drew
nearer
an
oddlooking
waggon
laden
with
oddlooking
packages
rolled
into
hobbiton
one
evening
and
toiled
up
the
hill
to
bag
end
the
startled
hobbits
peered
out
of
lamplit
doors
to
gape
at
it
it
was
driven
by
outlandish
folk
singing
strange
songs
dwarves
with
long
beards
and
deep
hoods
a
few
of
them
remained
at
bag
end
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
in
september
a
cart
came
in
through
bywater
from
the
direction
of
the
brandywine
bridge
in
broad
daylight
an
old
man
was
driving
it
all
alone
he
wore
a
tall
pointed
blue
hat
a
long
grey
cloak
and
a
silver
scarf
he
had
a
long
white
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
that
stuck
out
beyond
the
brim
of
his
hat
small
hobbitchildren
ran
after
the
cart
all
through
hobbiton
and
right
up
the
hill
it
had
a
cargo
of
fireworks
as
they
rightly
guessed
at
bilbo's
front
door
the
old
man
began
to
unload
there
were
great
bundles
of
fireworks
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
each
labelled
with
a
large
red
g
and
the
elfrune


that
was
gandalf's
mark
of
course
and
the
old
man
was
gandalf
the
wizard
whose
fame
in
the
shire
was
due
mainly
to
his
skill
with
fires
smokes
and
lights
his
real
business
was
far
more
difficult
and
dangerous
but
the
shirefolk
knew
nothing
about
it
to
them
he
was
just
one
of
the
'attractions'
at
the
party
hence
the
excitement
of
the
hobbitchildren
'g
for
grand'
they
shouted
and
the
old
man
smiled
they
knew
him
by
sight
though
he
only
appeared
in
hobbiton
occasionally
and
never
stopped
long
but
neither
they
nor
any
but
the
oldest
of
their
elders
had
seen
one
of
his
firework
displays

they
now
belonged
to
the
legendary
past

when
the
old
man
helped
by
bilbo
and
some
dwarves
had
finished
unloading
bilbo
gave
a
few
pennies
away
but
not
a
single
squib
or
cracker
was
forthcoming
to
the
disappointment
of
the
onlookers

'run
away
now'
said
gandalf
'you
will
get
plenty
when
the
time
comes'
then
he
disappeared
inside
with
bilbo
and
the
door
was
shut
the
young
hobbits
stared
at
the
door
in
vain
for
a
while
and
then
made
off
feeling
that
the
day
of
the
party
would
never
come

inside
bag
end
bilbo
and
gandalf
were
sitting
at
the
open
window
of
a
small
room
looking
out
west
on
to
the
garden
the
late
afternoon
was
bright
and
peaceful
the
flowers
glowed
red
and
golden
snapdragons
and
sunflowers
and
nasturtiums
trailing
all
over
the
turf
walls
and
peeping
in
at
the
round
windows

'how
bright
your
garden
looks'
said
gandalf

'yes'
said
bilbo
I
am
very
fond
indeed
of
it
and
of
all
the
dear
old
shire
but
I
think
I
need
a
holiday'

'you
mean
to
go
on
with
your
plan
then'

'i
do
I
made
up
my
mind
months
ago
and
I
haven't
changed
it'

'very
well
it
is
no
good
saying
any
more
stick
to
your
plan

your
whole
plan
mind

and
I
hope
it
will
turn
out
for
the
best
for
you
and
for
all
of
us'

'i
hope
so
anyway
I
mean
to
enjoy
myself
on
thursday
and
have
my
little
joke'

'who
will
laugh
I
wonder'
said
gandalf
shaking
his
head

'we
shall
see'
said
bilbo

the
next
day
more
carts
rolled
up
the
hill
and
still
more
carts
there
might
have
been
some
grumbling
about
'dealing
locally'
but
that
very
week
orders
began
to
pour
out
of
bag
end
for
every
kind
of
provision
commodity
or
luxury
that
could
be
obtained
in
hobbiton
or
bywater
or
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
people
became
enthusiastic
and
they
began
to
tick
off
the
days
on
the
calendar
and
they
watched
eagerly
for
the
postman
hoping
for
invitations

before
long
the
invitations
began
pouring
out
and
the
hobbiton
postoffice
was
blocked
and
the
bywater
postoffice
was
snowed
under
and
voluntary
assistant
postmen
were
called
for
there
was
a
constant
stream
of
them
going
up
the
hill
carrying
hundreds
of
polite
variations
on

thank
you
I
shall
certainly
come


a
notice
appeared
on
the
gate
at
bag
end
no
admittance
except
on
party
business
even
those
who
had
or
pretended
to
have
party
business
were
seldom
allowed
inside
bilbo
was
busy
writing
invitations
ticking
off
answers
packing
up
presents
and
making
some
private
preparations
of
his
own
from
the
time
of
gandalf's
arrival
he
remained
hidden
from
view

one
morning
the
hobbits
woke
to
find
the
large
field
south
of
bilbo's
front
door
covered
with
ropes
and
poles
for
tents
and
pavilions
a
special
entrance
was
cut
into
the
bank
leading
to
the
road
and
wide
steps
and
a
large
white
gate
were
built
there
the
three
hobbitfamilies
of
bagshot
row
adjoining
the
field
were
intensely
interested
and
generally
envied
old
gaffer
gamgee
stopped
even
pretending
to
work
in
his
garden


the
tents
began
to
go
up
there
was
a
specially
large
pavilion
so
big
that
the
tree
that
grew
in
the
field
was
right
inside
it
and
stood
proudly
near
one
end
at
the
head
of
the
chief
table
lanterns
were
hung
on
all
its
branches
more
promising
still
to
the
hobbits'
mind
an
enormous
openair
kitchen
was
erected
in
the
north
corner
of
the
field
a
draught
of
cooks
from
every
inn
and
eatinghouse
for
miles
around
arrived
to
supplement
the
dwarves
and
other
odd
folk
that
were
quartered
at
bag
end
excitement
rose
to
its
height

then
the
weather
clouded
over
that
was
on
wednesday
the
eve
of
the
party
anxiety
was
intense
then
thursday
september
the
22nd
actually
dawned
the
sun
got
up
the
clouds
vanished
flags
were
unfurled
and
the
fun
began

bilbo
baggins
called
it
a

party

but
it
was
really
a
variety
of
entertainments
rolled
into
one
practically
everybody
living
near
was
invited
a
very
few
were
overlooked
by
accident
but
as
they
turned
up
all
the
same
that
did
not
matter
many
people
from
other
parts
of
the
shire
were
also
asked
and
there
were
even
a
few
from
outside
the
borders
bilbo
met
the
guests
and
additions
at
the
new
white
gate
in
person
he
gave
away
presents
to
all
and
sundry

the
latter
were
those
who
went
out
again
by
a
back
way
and
came
in
again
by
the
gate
hobbits
give
presents
to
other
people
on
their
own
birthdays
not
very
expensive
ones
as
a
rule
and
not
so
lavishly
as
on
this
occasion
but
it
was
not
a
bad
system
actually
in
hobbiton
and
bywater
every
day
in
the
year
it
was
somebody's
birthday
so
that
every
hobbit
in
those
parts
had
a
fair
chance
of
at
least
one
present
at
least
once
a
week
but
they
never
got
tired
of
them

on
this
occasion
the
presents
were
unusually
good
the
hobbitchildren
were
so
excited
that
for
a
while
they
almost
forgot
about
eating
there
were
toys
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
all
beautiful
and
some
obviously
magical
many
of
them
had
indeed
been
ordered
a
year
before
and
had
come
all
the
way
from
the
mountain
and
from
dale
and
were
of
real
dwarfmake

when
every
guest
had
been
welcomed
and
was
finally
inside
the
gate
there
were
songs
dances
music
games
and
of
course
food
and
drink
there
were
three
official
meals
lunch
tea
and
dinner
or
supper
but
lunch
and
tea
were
marked
chiefly
by
the
fact
that
at
those
times
all
the
guests
were
sitting
down
and
eating
together
at
other
times
there
were
merely
lots
of
people
eating
and
drinking

continuously
from
elevenses
until
sixthirty
when
the
fireworks
started

the
fireworks
were
by
gandalf
they
were
not
only
brought
by
him
but
designed
and
made
by
him
and
the
special
effects
set
pieces
and
flights
of
rockets
were
let
off
by
him
but
there
was
also
a
generous
distribution
of
squibs
crackers
backarappers
sparklers
torches
dwarfcandles
elffountains
goblinbarkers
and
thunderclaps
they
were
all
superb
the
art
of
gandalf
improved
with
age

there
were
rockets
like
a
flight
of
scintillating
birds
singing
with
sweet
voices
there
were
green
trees
with
trunks
of
dark
smoke
their
leaves
opened
like
a
whole
spring
unfolding
in
a
moment
and
their
shining
branches
dropped
glowing
flowers
down
upon
the
astonished
hobbits
disappearing
with
a
sweet
scent
just
before
they
touched
their
upturned
faces
there
were
fountains
of
butterflies
that
flew
glittering
into
the
trees
there
were
pillars
of
coloured
fires
that
rose
and
turned
into
eagles
or
sailing
ships
or
a
phalanx
of
flying
swans
there
was
a
red
thunderstorm
and
a
shower
of
yellow
rain
there
was
a
forest
of
silver
spears
that
sprang
suddenly
into
the
air
with
a
yell
like
an
embattled
army
and
came
down
again
into
the
water
with
a
hiss
like
a
hundred
hot
snakes
and
there
was
also
one
last
surprise
in
honour
of
bilbo
and
it
startled
the
hobbits
exceedingly
as
gandalf
intended
the
lights
went
out
a
great
smoke
went
up
it
shaped
itself
like
a
mountain
seen
in
the
distance
and
began
to
glow
at
the
summit
it
spouted
green
and
scarlet
flames
out
flew
a
redgolden
dragon

not
lifesize
but
terribly
lifelike
fire
came
from
his
jaws
his
eyes
glared
down
there
was
a
roar
and
he
whizzed
three
times
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
they
all
ducked
and
many
fell
flat
on
their
faces
the
dragon
passed
like
an
express
train
turned
a
somersault
and
burst
over
bywater
with
a
deafening
explosion

'that
is
the
signal
for
supper'
said
bilbo
the
pain
and
alarm
vanished
at
once
and
the
prostrate
hobbits
leaped
to
their
feet
there
was
a
splendid
supper
for
everyone
for
everyone
that
is
except
those
invited
to
the
special
family
dinnerparty
this
was
held
in
the
great
pavilion
with
the
tree
the
invitations
were
limited
to
twelve
dozen
a
number
also
called
by
the
hobbits
one
gross
though
the
word
was
not
considered
proper
to
use
of
people
and
the
guests
were
selected
from
all
the
families
to
which
bilbo
and
frodo
were
related
with
the
addition
of
a
few
special
unrelated
friends
such
as
gandalf
many
young
hobbits
were
included
and
present
by
parental
permission
for
hobbits
were
easygoing
with
their
children
in
the
matter
of
sitting
up
late
especially
when
there
was
a
chance
of
getting
them
a
free
meal
bringing
up
young
hobbits
took
a
lot
of
provender

there
were
many
bagginses
and
boffins
and
also
many
tooks
and
brandybucks
there
were
various
grubbs
relations
of
bilbo
baggins'
grandmother
and
various
chubbs
connexions
of
his
took
grandfather
and
a
selection
of
burrowses
bolgers
bracegirdles
brockhouses
goodbodies
hornblowers
and
proudfoots
some
of
these
were
only
very
distantly
connected
with
bilbo
and
some
of
them
had
hardly
ever
been
in
hobbiton
before
as
they
lived
in
remote
corners
of
the
shire
the
sackvillebagginses
were
not
forgotten
otho
and
his
wife
lobelia
were
present
they
disliked
bilbo
and
detested
frodo
but
so
magnificent
was
the
invitation
card
written
in
golden
ink
that
they
had
felt
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
besides
their
cousin
bilbo
had
been
specializing
in
food
for
many
years
and
his
table
had
a
high
reputation

all
the
one
hundred
and
fortyfour
guests
expected
a
pleasant
feast
though
they
rather
dreaded
the
afterdinner
speech
of
their
host
an
inevitable
item
he
was
liable
to
drag
in
bits
of
what
he
called
poetry
and
sometimes
after
a
glass
or
two
would
allude
to
the
absurd
adventures
of
his
mysterious
journey
the
guests
were
not
disappointed
they
had
a

very

pleasant
feast
in
fact
an
engrossing
entertainment
rich
abundant
varied
and
prolonged
the
purchase
of
provisions
fell
almost
to
nothing
throughout
the
district
in
the
ensuing
weeks
but
as
bilbo's
catering
had
depleted
the
stocks
of
most
stores
cellars
and
warehouses
for
miles
around
that
did
not
matter
much

after
the
feast
more
or
less
came
the
speech
most
of
the
company
were
however
now
in
a
tolerant
mood
at
that
delightful
stage
which
they
called
'filling
up
the
corners'
they
were
sipping
their
favourite
drinks
and
nibbling
at
their
favourite
dainties
and
their
fears
were
forgotten
they
were
prepared
to
listen
to
anything
and
to
cheer
at
every
full
stop


my
dear
people

began
bilbo
rising
in
his
place
'hear
hear
hear'
they
shouted
and
kept
on
repeating
it
in
chorus
seeming
reluctant
to
follow
their
own
advice
bilbo
left
his
place
and
went
and
stood
on
a
chair
under
the
illuminated
tree
the
light
of
the
lanterns
fell
on
his
beaming
face
the
golden
buttons
shone
on
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
they
could
all
see
him
standing
waving
one
hand
in
the
air
the
other
was
in
his
trouserpocket


my
dear
bagginses
and
boffins

he
began
again

and
my
dear
tooks
and
brandybucks
and
grubbs
and
chubbs
and
burrowses
and
hornblowers
and
bolgers
bracegirdles
goodbodies
brockhouses
and
proudfoots

'proudfeet'
shouted
an
elderly
hobbit
from
the
back
of
the
pavilion
his
name
of
course
was
proudfoot
and
well
merited
his
feet
were
large
exceptionally
furry
and
both
were
on
the
table


proudfoots

repeated
bilbo

also
my
good
sackvillebagginses
that
I
welcome
back
at
last
to
bag
end
today
is
my
one
hundred
and
eleventh
birthday
I
am
eleventyone
today

'hurray
hurray
many
happy
returns'
they
shouted
and
they
hammered
joyously
on
the
tables
bilbo
was
doing
splendidly
this
was
the
sort
of
stuff
they
liked
short
and
obvious


I
hope
you
are
all
enjoying
yourselves
as
much
as
I
am

deafening
cheers
cries
of

yes

and

no

noises
of
trumpets
and
horns
pipes
and
flutes
and
other
musical
instruments
there
were
as
has
been
said
many
young
hobbits
present
hundreds
of
musical
crackers
had
been
pulled
most
of
them
bore
the
mark
dale
on
them
which
did
not
convey
much
to
most
of
the
hobbits
but
they
all
agreed
they
were
marvellous
crackers
they
contained
instruments
small
but
of
perfect
make
and
enchanting
tones
indeed
in
one
corner
some
of
the
young
tooks
and
brandybucks
supposing
uncle
bilbo
to
have
finished
since
he
had
plainly
said
all
that
was
necessary
now
got
up
an
impromptu
orchestra
and
began
a
merry
dancetune
master
everard
took
and
miss
melilot
brandybuck
got
on
a
table
and
with
bells
in
their
hands
began
to
dance
the
springlering
a
pretty
dance
but
rather
vigorous

but
bilbo
had
not
finished
seizing
a
horn
from
a
youngster
near
by
he
blew
three
loud
hoots
the
noise
subsided

I
shall
not
keep
you
long

he
cried
cheers
from
all
the
assembly

I
have
called
you
all
together
for
a
purpose

something
in
the
way
that
he
said
this
made
an
impression
there
was
almost
silence
and
one
or
two
of
the
tooks
pricked
up
their
ears


indeed
for
three
purposes
first
of
all
to
tell
you
that
I
am
immensely
fond
of
you
all
and
that
eleventyone
years
is
too
short
a
time
to
live
among
such
excellent
and
admirable
hobbits

tremendous
outburst
of
approval


I
don't
know
half
of
you
half
as
well
as
I
should
like
and
I
like
less
than
half
of
you
half
as
well
as
you
deserve

this
was
unexpected
and
rather
difficult
there
was
some
scattered
clapping
but
most
of
them
were
trying
to
work
it
out
and
see
if
it
came
to
a
compliment


secondly
to
celebrate
my
birthday

cheers
again

I
should
say
our
birthday
for
it
is
of
course
also
the
birthday
of
my
heir
and
nephew
frodo
he
comes
of
age
and
into
his
inheritance
today

some
perfunctory
clapping
by
the
elders
and
some
loud
shouts
of
'frodo
frodo
jolly
old
frodo'
from
the
juniors
the
sackvillebagginses
scowled
and
wondered
what
was
meant
by
'coming
into
his
inheritance'

together
we
score
one
hundred
and
fortyfour
your
numbers
were
chosen
to
fit
this
remarkable
total
one
gross
if
I
may
use
the
expression

no
cheers
this
was
ridiculous
many
of
his
guests
and
especially
the
sackvillebagginses
were
insulted
feeling
sure
they
had
only
been
asked
to
fill
up
the
required
number
like
goods
in
a
package
'one
gross
indeed
vulgar
expression'


it
is
also
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
refer
to
ancient
history
the
anniversary
of
my
arrival
by
barrel
at
esgaroth
on
the
long
lake
though
the
fact
that
it
was

my

birthday
slipped
my
memory
on
that
occasion
I
was
only
fiftyone
then
and
birthdays
did
not
seem
so
important
the
banquet
was
very
splendid
however
though
I
had
a
bad
cold
at
the
time
I
remember
and
could
only
say
'thag
you
very
buch'
I
now
repeat
it
more
correctly
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
to
my
little
party

obstinate
silence
they
all
feared
that
a
song
or
some
poetry
was
now
imminent
and
they
were
getting
bored
why
couldn't
he
stop
talking
and
let
them
drink
his
health
but
bilbo
did
not
sing
or
recite
he
paused
for
a
moment


thirdly
and
finally

he
said

I
wish
to
make
an
announcement

he
spoke
this
last
word
so
loudly
and
suddenly
that
everyone
sat
up
who
still
could

I
regret
to
announce
that

though
as
I
said
eleventyone
years
is
far
too
short
a
time
to
spend
among
you

this
is
the
end
I
am
going
I
am
leaving
now
goodbye


he
stepped
down
and
vanished
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
light
and
the
guests
all
blinked
when
they
opened
their
eyes
bilbo
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
one
hundred
and
fortyfour
flabbergasted
hobbits
sat
back
speechless
old
odo
proudfoot
removed
his
feet
from
the
table
and
stamped
then
there
was
a
dead
silence
until
suddenly
after
several
deep
breaths
every
baggins
boffin
took
brandybuck
grubb
chubb
burrows
bolger
bracegirdle
brockhouse
goodbody
hornblower
and
proudfoot
began
to
talk
at
once

it
was
generally
agreed
that
the
joke
was
in
very
bad
taste
and
more
food
and
drink
were
needed
to
cure
the
guests
of
shock
and
annoyance
'he's
mad
I
always
said
so'
was
probably
the
most
popular
comment
even
the
tooks
with
a
few
exceptions
thought
bilbo's
behaviour
was
absurd
for
the
moment
most
of
them
took
it
for
granted
that
his
disappearance
was
nothing
more
than
a
ridiculous
prank

but
old
rory
brandybuck
was
not
so
sure
neither
age
nor
an
enormous
dinner
had
clouded
his
wits
and
he
said
to
his
daughterinlaw
esmeralda
'there's
something
fishy
in
this
my
dear
I
believe
that
mad
baggins
is
off
again
silly
old
fool
but
why
worry
he
hasn't
taken
the
vittles
with
him'
he
called
loudly
to
frodo
to
send
the
wine
round
again

frodo
was
the
only
one
present
who
had
said
nothing
for
some
time
he
had
sat
silent
beside
bilbo's
empty
chair
and
ignored
all
remarks
and
questions
he
had
enjoyed
the
joke
of
course
even
though
he
had
been
in
the
know
he
had
difficulty
in
keeping
from
laughter
at
the
indignant
surprise
of
the
guests
but
at
the
same
time
he
felt
deeply
troubled
he
realized
suddenly
that
he
loved
the
old
hobbit
dearly
most
of
the
guests
went
on
eating
and
drinking
and
discussing
bilbo
baggins'
oddities
past
and
present
but
the
sackvillebagginses
had
already
departed
in
wrath
frodo
did
not
want
to
have
any
more
to
do
with
the
party
he
gave
orders
for
more
wine
to
be
served
then
he
got
up
and
drained
his
own
glass
silently
to
the
health
of
bilbo
and
slipped
out
of
the
pavilion

as
for
bilbo
baggins
even
while
he
was
making
his
speech
he
had
been
fingering
the
golden
ring
in
his
pocket
his
magic
ring
that
he
had
kept
secret
for
so
many
years
as
he
stepped
down
he
slipped
it
on
his
finger
and
he
was
never
seen
by
any
hobbit
in
hobbiton
again

he
walked
briskly
back
to
his
hole
and
stood
for
a
moment
listening
with
a
smile
to
the
din
in
the
pavilion
and
to
the
sounds
of
merrymaking
in
other
parts
of
the
field
then
he
went
in
he
took
off
his
party
clothes
folded
up
and
wrapped
in
tissuepaper
his
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
and
put
it
away
then
he
put
on
quickly
some
old
untidy
garments
and
fastened
round
his
waist
a
worn
leather
belt
on
it
he
hung
a
short
sword
in
a
battered
blackleather
scabbard
from
a
locked
drawer
smelling
of
mothballs
he
took
out
an
old
cloak
and
hood
they
had
been
locked
up
as
if
they
were
very
precious
but
they
were
so
patched
and
weatherstained
that
their
original
colour
could
hardly
be
guessed
it
might
have
been
dark
green
they
were
rather
too
large
for
him
he
then
went
into
his
study
and
from
a
large
strongbox
took
out
a
bundle
wrapped
in
old
cloths
and
a
leatherbound
manuscript
and
also
a
large
bulky
envelope
the
book
and
bundle
he
stuffed
into
the
top
of
a
heavy
bag
that
was
standing
there
already
nearly
full
into
the
envelope
he
slipped
his
golden
ring
and
its
fine
chain
and
then
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
frodo
at
first
he
put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
but
suddenly
he
removed
it
and
stuck
it
in
his
pocket
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
gandalf
came
quickly
in

'hullo'
said
bilbo
'i
wondered
if
you
would
turn
up'

'i
am
glad
to
find
you
visible'
replied
the
wizard
sitting
down
in
a
chair
'i
wanted
to
catch
you
and
have
a
few
final
words
I
suppose
you
feel
that
everything
has
gone
off
splendidly
and
according
to
plan'

'yes
I
do'
said
bilbo
though
that
flash
was
surprising
it
quite
startled
me
let
alone
the
others
a
little
addition
of
your
own
I
suppose'

it
was
you
have
wisely
kept
that
ring
secret
all
these
years
and
it
seemed
to
me
necessary
to
give
your
guests
something
else
that
would
seem
to
explain
your
sudden
vanishment'

'and
would
spoil
my
joke
you
are
an
interfering
old
busybody'
laughed
bilbo
'but
I
expect
you
know
best
as
usual'

'i
do

when
I
know
anything
but
I
don't
feel
too
sure
about
this
whole
affair
it
has
now
come
to
the
final
point
you
have
had
your
joke
and
alarmed
or
offended
most
of
your
relations
and
given
the
whole
shire
something
to
talk
about
for
nine
days
or
ninetynine
more
likely
are
you
going
any
further'

'yes
I
am
I
feel
I
need
a
holiday
a
very
long
holiday
as
I
have
told
you
before
probably
a
permanent
holiday
I
don't
expect
I
shall
return
in
fact
I
don't
mean
to
and
I
have
made
all
arrangements

'i
am
old
gandalf
I
don't
look
it
but
I
am
beginning
to
feel
it
in
my
heart
of
hearts

wellpreserved

indeed'
he
snorted
'why
I
feel
all
thin
sort
of

stretched

if
you
know
what
I
mean
like
butter
that
has
been
scraped
over
too
much
bread
that
can't
be
right
I
need
a
change
or
something'

gandalf
looked
curiously
and
closely
at
him
'no
it
does
not
seem
right'
he
said
thoughtfully
'no
after
all
I
believe
your
plan
is
probably
the
best'

'well
i've
made
up
my
mind
anyway
I
want
to
see
mountains
again
gandalf

mountains

and
then
find
somewhere
where
I
can

rest

in
peace
and
quiet
without
a
lot
of
relatives
prying
around
and
a
string
of
confounded
visitors
hanging
on
the
bell
I
might
find
somewhere
where
I
can
finish
my
book
I
have
thought
of
a
nice
ending
for
it

and
he
lived
happily
ever
after
to
the

end
of
his
days
'


gandalf
laughed
I
hope
he
will
but
nobody
will
read
the
book
however
it
ends'

'oh
they
may
in
years
to
come
frodo
has
read
some
already
as
far
as
it
has
gone
you'll
keep
an
eye
on
frodo
won't
you'

'yes
I
will

two
eyes
as
often
as
I
can
spare
them'

'he
would
come
with
me
of
course
if
I
asked
him
in
fact
he
offered
to
once
just
before
the
party
but
he
does
not
really
want
to
yet
I
want
to
see
the
wild
country
again
before
I
die
and
the
mountains
but
he
is
still
in
love
with
the
shire
with
woods
and
fields
and
little
rivers
he
ought
to
be
comfortable
here
I
am
leaving
everything
to
him
of
course
except
a
few
oddments
I
hope
he
will
be
happy
when
he
gets
used
to
being
on
his
own
it's
time
he
was
his
own
master
now'

'everything'
said
gandalf
'the
ring
as
well
you
agreed
to
that
you
remember'

'well
er
yes
I
suppose
so'
stammered
bilbo

'where
is
it'

'in
an
envelope
if
you
must
know'
said
bilbo
impatiently
'there
on
the
mantelpiece
well
no
here
it
is
in
my
pocket'
he
hesitated
'isn't
that
odd
now'
he
said
softly
to
himself
'yet
after
all
why
not
why
shouldn't
it
stay
there'

gandalf
looked
again
very
hard
at
bilbo
and
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eyes
'i
think
bilbo'
he
said
quietly
'i
should
leave
it
behind
don't
you
want
to'

'well
yes

and
no
now
it
comes
to
it
I
don't
like
parting
with
it
at
all
I
may
say
and
I
don't
really
see
why
I
should
why
do
you
want
me
to'
he
asked
and
a
curious
change
came
over
his
voice
it
was
sharp
with
suspicion
and
annoyance
'you
are
always
badgering
me
about
my
ring
but
you
have
never
bothered
me
about
the
other
things
that
I
got
on
my
journey'

'no
but
I
had
to
badger
you'
said
gandalf
'i
wanted
the
truth
it
was
important
magic
rings
are


well
magical
and
they
are
rare
and
curious
I
was
professionally
interested
in
your
ring
you
may
say
and
I
still
am
I
should
like
to
know
where
it
is
if
you
go
wandering
again
also
I
think

you
have
had
it
quite
long
enough
you
won't
need
it
any
more
bilbo
unless
I
am
quite
mistaken'

bilbo
flushed
and
there
was
an
angry
light
in
his
eyes
his
kindly
face
grew
hard
'why
not'
he
cried
'and
what
business
is
it
of
yours
anyway
to
know
what
I
do
with
my
own
things
it
is
my
own
I
found
it
it
came
to
me'

'yes
yes'
said
gandalf
'but
there
is
no
need
to
get
angry'

'if
I
am
it
is
your
fault'
said
bilbo
'it
is
mine
I
tell
you
my
own
my
precious
yes
my
precious'

the
wizard's
face
remained
grave
and
attentive
and
only
a
flicker
in
his
deep
eyes
showed
that
he
was
startled
and
indeed
alarmed
'it
has
been
called
that
before'
he
said
'but
not
by
you'

'but
I
say
it
now
and
why
not
even
if
gollum
said
the
same
once
it's
not
his
now
but
mine
and
I
shall
keep
it
I
say'

gandalf
stood
up
he
spoke
sternly
'you
will
be
a
fool
if
you
do
bilbo'
he
said
'you
make
that
clearer
with
every
word
you
say
it
has
got
far
too
much
hold
on
you
let
it
go
and
then
you
can
go
yourself
and
be
free'

'i'll
do
as
I
choose
and
go
as
I
please'
said
bilbo
obstinately

'now
now
my
dear
hobbit
'
said
gandalf
'all
your
long
life
we
have
been
friends
and
you
owe
me
something
come
do
as
you
promised
give
it
up
'

'well
if
you
want
my
ring
yourself
say
so'
cried
bilbo
'but
you
won't
get
it
I
won't
give
my
precious
away
I
tell
you'
his
hand
strayed
to
the
hilt
of
his
small
sword

gandalf's
eyes
flashed
it
will
be
my
turn
to
get
angry
soon'
he
said
if
you
say
that
again
I
shall
then
you
will
see
gandalf
the
grey
uncloaked'
he
took
a
step
towards
the
hobbit
and
he
seemed
to
grow
tall
and
menacing
his
shadow
filled
the
little
room


bilbo
backed
away
to
the
wall
breathing
hard
his
hand
clutching
at
his
pocket
they
stood
for
a
while
facing
one
another
and
the
air
of
the
room
tingled
gandalf's
eyes
remained
bent
on
the
hobbit
slowly
his
hands
relaxed
and
he
began
to
tremble

'i
don't
know
what
has
come
over
you
gandalf'
he
said
'you
have
never
been
like
this
before
what
is
it
all
about
it
is
mine
isn't
it
I
found
it
and
gollum
would
have
killed
me
if
I
hadn't
kept
it
i'm
not
a
thief
whatever
he
said'

'i
have
never
called
you
one'
gandalf
answered
'and
I
am
not
one
either
I
am
not
trying
to
rob
you
but
to
help
you
I
wish
you
would
trust
me
as
you
used'
he
turned
away
and
the
shadow
passed
he
seemed
to
dwindle
again
to
an
old
grey
man
bent
and
troubled

bilbo
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
I
am
sorry'
he
said
'but
I
felt
so
queer
and
yet
it
would
be
a
relief
in
a
way
not
to
be
bothered
with
it
any
more
it
has
been
so
growing
on
my
mind
lately
sometimes
I
have
felt
it
was
like
an
eye
looking
at
me
and
I
am
always
wanting
to
put
it
on
and
disappear
don't
you
know
or
wondering
if
it
is
safe
and
pulling
it
out
to
make
sure
I
tried
locking
it
up
but
I
found
I
couldn't
rest
without
it
in
my
pocket
I
don't
know
why
and
I
don't
seem
able
to
make
up
my
mind'

'then
trust
mine'
said
gandalf
'it
is
quite
made
up
go
away
and
leave
it
behind
stop
possessing
it
give
it
to
frodo
and
I
will
look
after
him'

bilbo
stood
for
a
moment
tense
and
undecided
presently
he
sighed
'all
right'
he
said
with
an
effort
I
will'
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
rather
ruefully
'after
all
that's
what
this
party
business
was
all
about
really
to
give
away
lots
of
birthday
presents
and
somehow
make
it
easier
to
give
it
away
at
the
same
time
it
hasn't
made
it
any
easier
in
the
end
but
it
would
be
a
pity
to
waste
all
my
preparations
it
would
quite
spoil
the
joke'

'indeed
it
would
take
away
the
only
point
I
ever
saw
in
the
affair'
said
gandalf

'very
well'
said
bilbo
'it
goes
to
frodo
with
all
the
rest'
he
drew
a
deep
breath
'and
now
I
really
must
be
starting
or
somebody
else
will
catch
me
I
have
said
goodbye
and
I
couldn't
bear
to
do
it
all
over
again'
he
picked
up
his
bag
and
moved
to
the
door

'you
have
still
got
the
ring
in
your
pocket'
said
the
wizard
'well
so
I
have'
cried
bilbo
'and
my
will
and
all
the
other
documents
too
you
had
better
take
it
and
deliver
it
for
me
that
will
be
safest'

'no
don't
give
the
ring
to
me'
said
gandalf
'put
it
on
the
mantelpiece
it
will
be
safe
enough
there
till
frodo
comes
I
shall
wait
for
him'

bilbo
took
out
the
envelope
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
set
it
by
the
clock
his
hand
jerked
back
and
the
packet
fell
on
the
floor
before
he
could
pick
it
up
the
wizard
stooped
and
seized
it
and
set
it
in
its
place
a
spasm
of
anger
passed
swiftly
over
the
hobbit's
face
again
suddenly
it
gave
way
to
a
look
of
relief
and
a
laugh
'well
that's
that'
he
said
'now
i'm
off'

they
went
out
into
the
hall
bilbo
chose
his
favourite
stick
from
the
stand
then
he
whistled
three
dwarves
came
out
of
different
rooms
where
they
had
been
busy

'is
everything
ready'
asked
bilbo
'everything
packed
and
labelled'

'everything'
they
answered

'well
let's
start
then'
he
stepped
out
of
the
frontdoor

it
was
a
fine
night
and
the
black
sky
was
dotted
with
stars
he
looked
up
sniffing
the
air
'what
fun
what
fun
to
be
off
again
off
on
the
road
with
dwarves
this
is
what
I
have
really
been
longing
for
for
years
goodbye
'
he
said
looking
at
his
old
home
and
bowing
to
the
door
'goodbye
gandalf'

'goodbye
for
the
present
bilbo
take
care
of
yourself
you
are
old
enough
and
perhaps
wise
enough'

'take
care
I
don't
care
don't
you
worry
about
me
I
am
as
happy
now
as
I
have
ever
been
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
but
the
time
has
come
I
am
being
swept
off
my
feet
at
last'
he
added
and
then
in
a
low
voice
as
if
to
himself
he
sang
softly
in
the
dark

the
road
goes
ever
on
and
on

down
from
the
door
where
it
began

now
far
ahead
the
road
has
gone

and
I
must
follow
if
I
can

pursuing
it
with
eager
feet

until
it
joins
some
larger
way

where
many
paths
and
errands
meet

and
whither
then
I
cannot
say

he
paused
silent
for
a
moment
then
without
another
word
he
turned
away
from
the
lights
and
voices
in
the
fields
and
tents
and
followed
by
his
three
companions
went
round
into
his
garden
and
trotted
down
the
long
sloping
path
he
jumped
over
a
low
place
in
the
hedge
at
the
bottom
and
took
to
the
meadows
passing
into
the
night
like
a
rustle
of
wind
in
the
grass

gandalf
remained
for
a
while
staring
after
him
into
the
darkness
'goodbye
my
dear
bilbo

until
our
next
meeting'
he
said
softly
and
went
back
indoors

frodo
came
in
soon
afterwards
and
found
him
sitting
in
the
dark
deep
in
thought
'has
he
gone'
he
asked

'yes'
answered
gandalf
'he
has
gone
at
last'

'
I
wish

I
mean
I
hoped
until
this
evening
that
it
was
only
a
joke'
said
frodo
'but
I
knew
in
my
heart
that
he
really
meant
to
go
he
always
used
to
joke
about
serious
things
I
wish
I
had
come
back
sooner
just
to
see
him
off'

I
think
really
he
preferred
slipping
off
quietly
in
the
end'
said
gandalf
'don't
be
too
troubled
he'll
be
all
right

now
he
left
a
packet
for
you
there
it
is'

frodo
took
the
envelope
from
the
mantelpiece
and
glanced
at
it
but
did
not
open
it

'you'll
find
his
will
and
all
the
other
documents
in
there
I
think'
said
the
wizard
'you
are
the
master
of
bag
end
now
and
also
I
fancy
you'll
find
a
golden
ring'

'the
ring'
exclaimed
frodo
'has
he
left
me
that
I
wonder
why
still
it
may
be
useful'

'it
may
and
it
may
not'
said
gandalf
'i
should
not
make
use
of
it
if
I
were
you
but
keep
it
secret
and
keep
it
safe
now
I
am
going
to
bed'

as
master
of
bag
end
frodo
felt
it
his
painful
duty
to
say
goodbye
to
the
guests
rumours
of
strange
events
had
by
now
spread
all
over
the
field
but
frodo
would
only
say

no
doubt
everything
will
be
cleared
up
in
the
morning

about
midnight
carriages
came
for
the
important
folk
one
by
one
they
rolled
away
filled
with
full
but
very
unsatisfied
hobbits
gardeners
came
by
arrangement
and
removed
in
wheelbarrows
those
that
had
inadvertently
remained
behind

night
slowly
passed
the
sun
rose
the
hobbits
rose
rather
later
morning
went
on
people
came
and
began
by
orders
to
clear
away
the
pavilions
and
the
tables
and
the
chairs
and
the
spoons
and
knives
and
bottles
and
plates
and
the
lanterns
and
the
flowering
shrubs
in
boxes
and
the
crumbs
and
crackerpaper
the
forgotten
bags
and
gloves
and
handkerchiefs
and
the
uneaten
food
a
very
small
item
then
a
number
of
other
people
came
without
orders
bagginses
and
boffins
and
bolgers
and
tooks
and
other
guests
that
lived
or
were
staying
near
by
midday
when
even
the
bestfed
were
out
and
about
again
there
was
a
large
crowd
at
bag
end
uninvited
but
not
unexpected

frodo
was
waiting
on
the
step
smiling
but
looking
rather
tired
and
worried
he
welcomed
all
the
callers
but
he
had
not
much
more
to
say
than
before
his
reply
to
all
inquiries
was
simply
this
'mr
bilbo
baggins
has
gone
away
as
far
as
I
know
for
good'
some
of
the
visitors
he
invited
to
come
inside
as
bilbo
had
left
'messages'
for
them

inside
in
the
hall
there
was
piled
a
large
assortment
of
packages
and
parcels
and
small
articles
of
furniture
on
every
item
there
was
a
label
tied
there
were
several
labels
of
this
sort


for
adelard
took
for
his
very
own
from
bilbo

on
an
umbrella
adelard
had
carried
off
many
unlabelled
ones



for
dora
baggins
in
memory
of
a
long
correspondence
with
love
from
bilbo

on
a
large
wastepaper
basket
dora
was
drogo's
sister
and
the
eldest
surviving
female
relative
of
bilbo
and
frodo
she
was
ninetynine
and
had
written
reams
of
good
advice
for
more
than
half
a
century


for
milo
burrows
hoping
it
will
be
useful
from
bb

on
a
gold
pen
and
inkbottle
milo
never
answered
letters


for
angelica's
use
from
uncle
bilbo

on
a
round
convex
mirror
she
was
a
young
baggins
and
too
obviously
considered
her
face
shapely


for
the
collection
of
hugo
bracegirdle
from
a
contributor

on
an
empty
bookcase
hugo
was
a
great
borrower
of
books
and
worse
than
usual
at
returning
them


for
lobelia
sackvillebaggins
as
a
present

on
a
case
of
silver
spoons
bilbo
believed
that
she
had
acquired
a
good
many
of
his
spoons
while
he
was
away
on
his
former
journey
lobelia
knew
that
quite
well
when
she
arrived
later
in
the
day
she
took
the
point
at
once
but
she
also
took
the
spoons

this
is
only
a
small
selection
of
the
assembled
presents
bilbo's
residence
had
got
rather
cluttered
up
with
things
in
the
course
of
his
long
life
it
was
a
tendency
of
hobbitholes
to
get
cluttered
up
for
which
the
custom
of
giving
so
many
birthdaypresents
was
largely
responsible
not
of
course
that
the
birthdaypresents
were
always

new

there
were
one
or
two
old

mathoms

of
forgotten
uses
that
had
circulated
all
around
the
district
but
bilbo
had
usually
given
new
presents
and
kept
those
that
he
received
the
old
hole
was
now
being
cleared
a
little

every
one
of
the
various
parting
gifts
had
labels
written
out
personally
by
bilbo
and
several
had
some
point
or
some
joke
but
of
course
most
of
the
things
were
given
where
they
would
be
wanted
and
welcome
the
poorer
hobbits
and
especially
those
of
bagshot
row
did
very
well
old
gaffer
gamgee
got
two
sacks
of
potatoes
a
new
spade
a
woollen
waistcoat
and
a
bottle
of
ointment
for
creaking
joints
old
rory
brandybuck
in
return
for
much
hospitality
got
a
dozen
bottles
of
old
winyards
a
strong
red
wine
from
the
southfarthing
and
now
quite
mature
as
it
had
been
laid
down
by
bilbo's
father
rory
quite
forgave
bilbo
and
voted
him
a
capital
fellow
after
the
first
bottle

there
was
plenty
of
everything
left
for
frodo
and
of
course
all
the
chief
treasures
as
well
as
the
books
pictures
and
more
than
enough
furniture
were
left
in
his
possession
there
was
however
no
sign
nor
mention
of
money
or
jewellery
not
a
pennypiece
or
a
glass
bead
was
given
away

frodo
had
a
very
trying
time
that
afternoon
a
false
rumour
that
the
whole
household
was
being
distributed
free
spread
like
wildfire
and
before
long
the
place
was
packed
with
people
who
had
no
business
there
but
could
not
be
kept
out
labels
got
torn
off
and
mixed
and
quarrels
broke
out
some
people
tried
to
do
swaps
and
deals
in
the
hall
and
others
tried
to
make

off

with
minor
items
not
addressed
to
them
or
with
anything
that
seemed
unwanted
or
unwatched
the
road
to
the
gate
was
blocked
with
barrows
and
handcarts

in
the
middle
of
the
commotion
the
sackvillebagginses
arrived
frodo
had
retired
for
a
while
and
left
his
friend
merry
brandybuck
to
keep
an
eye
on
things
when
otho
loudly
demanded
to
see
frodo
merry
bowed
politely

'he
is
indisposed'
he
said
'he
is
resting'

'hiding
you
mean'
said
lobelia
'anyway
we
want
to
see
him
and
we
mean
to
see
him
just
go
and
tell
him
so'

merry
left
them
a
long
while
in
the
hall
and
they
had
time
to
discover
their
parting
gift
of
spoons
it
did
not
improve
their
tempers
eventually
they
were
shown
into
the
study
frodo
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
a
lot
of
papers
in
front
of
him
he
looked
indisposed

to
see
sackvillebagginses
at
any
rate
and
he
stood
up
fidgeting
with
something
in
his
pocket
but
he
spoke
quite
politely


the
sackvillebagginses
were
rather
offensive
they
began
by
offering
him
bad
bargainprices
as
between
friends
for
various
valuable
and
unlabelled
things
when
frodo
replied
that
only
the
things
specially
directed
by
bilbo
were
being
given
away
they
said
the
whole
affair
was
very
fishy

'only
one
thing
is
clear
to
me'
said
otho
'and
that
is
that
you
are
doing
exceedingly
well
out
of
it
I
insist
on
seeing
the
will'

otho
would
have
been
bilbo's
heir
but
for
the
adoption
of
frodo
he
read
the
will
carefully
and
snorted
it
was
unfortunately
very
clear
and
correct
according
to
the
legal
customs
of
hobbits
which
demand
among
other
things
seven
signatures
of
witnesses
in
red
ink

'foiled
again'
he
said
to
his
wife
'and
after
waiting

sixty

years
spoons
fiddlesticks'
he
snapped
his
fingers
under
frodo's
nose
and
slumped
off
but
lobelia
was
not
so
easily
got
rid
of
a
little
later
frodo
came
out
of
the
study
to
see
how
things
were
going
on
and
found
her
still
about
the
place
investigating
nooks
and
comers
and
tapping
the
floors
he
escorted
her
firmly
off
the
premises
after
he
had
relieved
her
of
several
small
but
rather
valuable
articles
that
had
somehow
fallen
inside
her
umbrella
her
face
looked
as
if
she
was
in
the
throes
of
thinking
out
a
really
crushing
parting
remark
but
all
she
found
to
say
turning
round
on
the
step
was

'you'll
live
to
regret
it
young
fellow
why
didn't
you
go
too
you
don't
belong
here
you're
no
baggins

you

you're
a
brandybuck'

'did
you
hear
that
merry
that
was
an
insult
if
you
like'
said
frodo
as
he
shut
the
door
on
her

'it
was
a
compliment'
said
merry
brandybuck
'and
so
of
course
not
true'

then
they
went
round
the
hole
and
evicted
three
young
hobbits
two
boffins
and
a
bolger
who
were
knocking
holes
in
the
walls
of
one
of
the
cellars
frodo
also
had
a
tussle
with
young
sancho
proudfoot
old
odo
proudfoot's
grandson
who
had
begun
an
excavation
in
the
larger
pantry
where
he
thought
there
was
an
echo
the
legend
of
bilbo's
gold
excited
both
curiosity
and
hope
for
legendary
gold
mysteriously
obtained
if
not
positively
illgotten
is
as
every
one
knows
any
one's
for
the
finding

unless
the
search
is
interrupted

when
he
had
overcome
sancho
and
pushed
him
out
frodo
collapsed
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
it's
time
to
close
the
shop
merry'
he
said
'lock
the
door
and
don't
open
it
to
anyone
today
not
even
if
they
bring
a
battering
ram'
then
he
went
to
revive
himself
with
a
belated
cup
of
tea

he
had
hardly
sat
down
when
there
came
a
soft
knock
at
the
frontdoor
'lobelia
again
most
likely'
he
thought
'she
must
have
thought
of
something
really
nasty
and
have
come
back
again
to
say
it
it
can
wait'

he
went
on
with
his
tea
the
knock
was
repeated
much
louder
but
he
took
no
notice
suddenly
the
wizard's
head
appeared
at
the
window

'if
you
don't
let
me
in
frodo
I
shall
blow
your
door
right
down
your
hole
and
out
through
the
hill'
he
said

'my
dear
gandalf
half
a
minute'
cried
frodo
running
out
of
the
room
to
the
door
'come
in
come
in
I
thought
it
was
lobelia'

'then
I
forgive
you
but
I
saw
her
some
time
ago
driving
a
ponytrap
towards
bywater
with
a
face
that
would
have
curdled
new
milk'

'she
had
already
nearly
curdled
me
honestly
I
nearly
tried
on
bilbo's
ring
I
longed
to
disappear'

'don't
do
that'
said
gandalf
sitting
down
'do
be
careful
of
that
ring
frodo
in
fact
it
is
partly
about
that
that
I
have
come
to
say
a
last
word'

'well
what
about
it'

'what
do
you
know
already'

'only
what
bilbo
told
me
I
have
heard
his
story
how
he
found
it
and
how
he
used
it
on
his
journey
I
mean'

'which
story
I
wonder'
said
gandalf


'oh
not
what
he
told
the
dwarves
and
put
in
his
book'
said
frodo
'he
told
me
the
true
story
soon
after
I
came
to
live
here
he
said
you
had
pestered
him
till
he
told
you
so
I
had
better
know
too
no
secrets
between
us
frodo
he
said
but
they
are
not
to
go
any
further
it's
mine
anyway'

'that's
interesting'
said
gandalf
'well
what
did
you
think
of
it
all'

'if
you
mean
inventing
all
that
about
a
present
well
I
thought
the
true
story
much
more
likely
and
I
couldn't
see
the
point
of
altering
it
at
all
it
was
very
unlike
bilbo
to
do
so
anyway
and
I
thought
it
rather
odd'

'so
did
I
but
odd
things
may
happen
to
people
that
have
such
treasures

if
they
use
them
let
it
be
a
warning
to
you
to
be
very
careful
with
it
it
may
have
other
powers
than
just
making
you
vanish
when
you
wish
to'

'i
don't
understand'
said
frodo

'neither
do
i'
answered
the
wizard
'i
have
merely
begun
to
wonder
about
the
ring
especially
since
last
night
no
need
to
worry
but
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
use
it
very
seldom
or
not
at
all
at
least
I
beg
you
not
to
use
it
in
any
way
that
will
cause
talk
or
rouse
suspicion
I
say
again
keep
it
safe
and
keep
it
secret'

'you
are
very
mysterious
what
are
you
afraid
of'

'i
am
not
certain
so
I
will
say
no
more
I
may
be
able
to
tell
you
something
when
I
come
back
I
am
going
off
at
once
so
this
is
goodbye
for
the
present'
he
got
up

'at
once'
cried
frodo
'why
I
thought
you
were
staying
on
for
at
least
a
week
I
was
looking
forward
to
your
help'

'i
did
mean
to

but
I
have
had
to
change
my
mind
I
may
be
away
for
a
good
while
but
i'll
come
and
see
you
again
as
soon
as
I
can
expect
me
when
you
see
me
I
shall
slip
in
quietly
I
shan't
often
be
visiting
the
shire
openly
again
I
find
that
I
have
become
rather
unpopular
they
say
I
am
a
nuisance
and
a
disturber
of
the
peace
some
people
are
actually
accusing
me
of
spiriting
bilbo
away
or
worse
if
you
want
to
know
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
plot
between
you
and
me
to
get
hold
of
his
wealth'

'some
people'
exclaimed
frodo
'you
mean
otho
and
lobelia
how
abominable
I
would
give
them
bag
end
and
everything
else
if
I
could
get
bilbo
back
and
go
off
tramping
in
the
country
with
him
I
love
the
shire
but
I
begin
to
wish
somehow
that
I
had
gone
too
I
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
see
him
again'

'so
do
i'
said
gandalf
'and
I
wonder
many
other
things
goodbye
now
take
care
of
yourself
look
out
for
me
especially
at
unlikely
times
goodbye'

frodo
saw
him
to
the
door
he
gave
a
final
wave
of
his
hand
and
walked
off
at
a
surprising
pace
but
frodo
thought
the
old
wizard
looked
unusually
bent
almost
as
if
he
was
carrying
a
great
weight
the
evening
was
closing
in
and
his
cloaked
figure
quickly
vanished
into
the
twilight
frodo
did
not
see
him
again
for
a
long
time


chapter
2


the
shadow
of
the
past


the
talk
did
not
die
down
in
nine
or
even
ninetynine
days
the
second
disappearance
of
mr
bilbo
baggins
was
discussed
in
hobbiton
and
indeed
all
over
the
shire
for
a
year
and
a
day
and
was
remembered
much
longer
than
that
it
became
a
firesidestory
for
young
hobbits
and
eventually
mad
baggins
who
used
to
vanish
with
a
bang
and
a
flash
and
reappear
with
bags
of
jewels
and
gold
became
a
favourite
character
of
legend
and
lived
on
long
after
all
the
true
events
were
forgotten

but
in
the
meantime
the
general
opinion
in
the
neighbourhood
was
that
bilbo
who
had
always
been
rather
cracked
had
at
last
gone
quite
mad
and
had
run
off
into
the
blue
there
he
had
undoubtedly
fallen
into
a
pool
or
a
river
and
come
to
a
tragic
but
hardly
an
untimely
end
the
blame
was
mostly
laid
on
gandalf

'if
only
that
dratted
wizard
will
leave
young
frodo
alone
perhaps
he'll
settle
down
and
grow
some
hobbitsense'
they
said
and
to
all
appearance
the
wizard
did
leave
frodo
alone
and
he
did
settle
down
but
the
growth
of
hobbitsense
was
not
very
noticeable
indeed
he
at
once
began
to
carry
on
bilbo's
reputation
for
oddity
he
refused
to
go
into
mourning
and
the
next
year
he
gave
a
party
in
honour
of
bilbo's
hundredandtwelfth
birthday
which
he
called
hundredweight
feast
but
that
was
short
of
the
mark
for
twenty
guests
were
invited
and
there
were
several
meals
at
which
it
snowed
food
and
rained
drink
as
hobbits
say

some
people
were
rather
shocked
but
frodo
kept
up
the
custom
of
giving
bilbo's
birthday
party
year
after
year
until
they
got
used
to
it
he
said
that
he
did
not
think
bilbo
was
dead
when
they
asked
'where
is
he
then'
he
shrugged
his
shoulders

he
lived
alone
as
bilbo
had
done
but
he
had
a
good
many
friends
especially
among
the
younger
hobbits
mostly
descendants
of
the
old
took
who
had
as
children
been
fond
of
bilbo
and
often
in
and
out
of
bag
end
folco
boffin
and
fredegar
bolger
were
two
of
these
but
his
closest
friends
were
peregrin
took
usually
called
pippin
and
merry
brandybuck
his
real
name
was
meriadoc
but
that
was
seldom
remembered
frodo
went
tramping
all
over
the
shire
with
them
but
more
often
he
wandered
by
himself
and
to
the
amazement
of
sensible
folk
he
was
sometimes
seen
far
from
home
walking
in
the
hills
and
woods
under
the
starlight
merry
and
pippin
suspected
that
he
visited
the
elves
at
times
as
bilbo
had
done

as
time
went
on
people
began
to
notice
that
frodo
also
showed
signs
of
good
'preservation'
outwardly
he
retained
the
appearance
of
a
robust
and
energetic
hobbit
just
out
of
his
tweens
'some
folk
have
all
the
luck'
they
said
but
it
was
not
until
frodo
approached
the
usually
more
sober
age
of
fifty
that
they
began
to
think
it
queer

frodo
himself
after
the
first
shock
found
that
being
his
own
master
and

the

mr
baggins
of
bag
end
was
rather
pleasant
for
some
years
he
was
quite
happy
and
did
not
worry
much
about
the
future
but
half
unknown
to
himself
the
regret
that
he
had
not
gone
with
bilbo
was
steadily
growing
he
found
himself
wondering
at
times
especially
in
the
autumn
about
the
wild
lands
and
strange
visions
of
mountains
that
he
had
never
seen
came
into
his
dreams
he
began
to
say
to
himself
'perhaps
I
shall
cross
the
river
myself
one
day'
to
which
the
other
half
of
his
mind
always
replied
'not
yet'

so
it
went
on
until
his
forties
were
running
out
and
his
fiftieth
birthday
was
drawing
near
fifty
was
a
number
that
he
felt
was
somehow
significant
or
ominous
it
was
at
any
rate
at
that
age
that
adventure
had
suddenly
befallen
bilbo
frodo
began
to
feel
restless
and
the
old
paths
seemed
too
welltrodden
he
looked
at
maps
and
wondered
what
lay
beyond
their
edges
maps
made
in
the
shire
showed
mostly
white
spaces
beyond
its
borders
he
took
to
wandering
further
afield
and
more
often
by
himself
and
merry
and
his
other
friends
watched
him
anxiously
often
he
was
seen
walking
and
talking
with
the
strange
wayfarers
that
began
at
this
time
to
appear
in
the
shire

there
were
rumours
of
strange
things
happening
in
the
world
outside
and
as
gandalf
had
not
at
that
time
appeared
or
sent
any
message
for
several
years
frodo
gathered
all
the
news
he
could
elves
who
seldom
walked
in
the
shire
could
now
be
seen
passing
westward
through
the
woods
in
the
evening
passing
and
not
returning
but
they
were
leaving
middleearth
and
were
no
longer
concerned
with
its
troubles
there
were
however
dwarves
on
the
road
in
unusual
numbers
the
ancient
eastwest
road
ran
through
the
shire
to
its
end
at
the
grey
havens
and
dwarves
had
always
used
it
on
their
way
to
their
mines
in
the
blue
mountains
they
were
the
hobbits'
chief
source
of
news
from
distant
parts

if
they
wanted
any
as
a
rule
dwarves
said
little
and
hobbits
asked
no
more
but
now
frodo
often
met
strange
dwarves
of
far
countries
seeking
refuge
in
the
west
they
were
troubled
and
some
spoke
in
whispers
of
the
enemy
and
of
the
land
of
mordor


that
name
the
hobbits
only
knew
in
legends
of
the
dark
past
like
a
shadow
in
the
background
of
their
memories
but
it
was
ominous
and
disquieting
it
seemed
that
the
evil
power
in
mirkwood
had
been
driven
out
by
the
white
council
only
to
reappear
in
greater
strength
in
the
old
strongholds
of
mordor
the
dark
tower
had
been
rebuilt
it
was
said
from
there
the
power
was
spreading
far
and
wide
and
away
far
east
and
south
there
were
wars
and
growing
fear
orcs
were
multiplying
again
in
the
mountains
trolls
were
abroad
no
longer
dullwitted
but
cunning
and
armed
with
dreadful
weapons
and
there
were
murmured
hints
of
creatures
more
terrible
than
all
these
but
they
had
no
name

little
of
all
this
of
course
reached
the
ears
of
ordinary
hobbits
but
even
the
deafest
and
most
stayathome
began
to
hear
queer
tales
and
those
whose
business
took
them
to
the
borders
saw
strange
things
the
conversation
in

the
green
dragon

at
bywater
one
evening
in
the
spring
of
frodo's
fiftieth
year
showed
that
even
in
the
comfortable
heart
of
the
shire
rumours
had
been
heard
though
most
hobbits
still
laughed
at
them

sam
gamgee
was
sitting
in
one
corner
near
the
fire
and
opposite
him
was
ted
sandyman
the
miller's
son
and
there
were
various
other
rustic
hobbits
listening
to
their
talk

'queer
things
you
do
hear
these
days
to
be
sure'
said
sam

'ah'
said
ted
'you
do
if
you
listen
but
I
can
hear
firesidetales
and
children's
stories
at
home
if
I
want
to'

'no
doubt
you
can'
retorted
sam
'and
I
daresay
there's
more
truth
in
some
of
them
than
you
reckon
who
invented
the
stories
anyway
take
dragons
now'

'no
thank
'ee'
said
ted
'i
won't
I
heard
tell
of
them
when
I
was
a
youngster
but
there's
no
call
to
believe
in
them
now
there's
only
one
dragon
in
bywater
and
that's
green'
he
said
getting
a
general
laugh

'all
right'
said
sam
laughing
with
the
rest
'but
what
about
these
treemen
these
giants
as
you
might
call
them
they
do
say
that
one
bigger
than
a
tree
was
seen
up
away
beyond
the
north
moors
not
long
back'

'who's

they
'

'my
cousin
hal
for
one
he
works
for
mr
boffin
at
overhill
and
goes
up
to
the
northfarthing
for
the
hunting
he

saw

one'

'says
he
did
perhaps
your
hal's
always
saying
he's
seen
things
and
maybe
he
sees
things
that
ain't
there'

'but
this
one
was
as
big
as
an
elm
tree
and
walking

walking
seven
yards
to
a
stride
if
it
was
an
inch'

'then
I
bet
it
wasn't
an
inch
what
he
saw

was

an
elm
tree
as
like
as
not'

'but
this
one
was

walking

I
tell
you
and
there
ain't
no
elm
tree
on
the
north
moors'

'then
hal
can't
have
seen
one'
said
ted
there
was
some
laughing
and
clapping
the
audience
seemed
to
think
that
ted
had
scored
a
point

'all
the
same'
said
sam
'you
can't
deny
that
others
besides
our
halfast
have
seen
queer
folk
crossing
the
shire

crossing
it
mind
you
there
are
more
that
are
turned
back
at
the
borders
the
bounders
have
never
been
so
busy
before

'and
i've
heard
tell
that
elves
are
moving
west
they
do
say
they
are
going
to
the
harbours
out
away
beyond
the
white
towers'
sam
waved
his
arm
vaguely
neither
he
nor
any
of
them
knew
how
far
it
was
to
the
sea
past
the
old
towers
beyond
the
western
borders
of
the
shire
but
it
was
an
old
tradition
that
away
over
there
stood
the
grey
havens
from
which
at
times
elvenships
set
sail
never
to
return

'they
are
sailing
sailing
sailing
over
the
sea
they
are
going
into
the
west
and
leaving
us'
said
sam
half
chanting
the
words
shaking
his
head
sadly
and
solemnly
but
ted
laughed

'well
that
isn't
anything
new
if
you
believe
the
old
tales
and
I
don't
see
what
it
matters
to
me
or
you
let
them
sail
but
I
warrant
you
haven't
seen
them
doing
it
nor
any
one
else
in
the
shire'


'well
I
don't
know'
said
sam
thoughtfully
he
believed
he
had
once
seen
an
elf
in
the
woods
and
still
hoped
to
see
more
one
day
of
all
the
legends
that
he
had
heard
in
his
early
years
such
fragments
of
tales
and
halfremembered
stories
about
the
elves
as
the
hobbits
knew
had
always
moved
him
most
deeply
'there
are
some
even
in
these
parts
as
know
the
fair
folk
and
get
news
of
them'
he
said
'there's
mr
baggins
now
that
I
work
for
he
told
me
that
they
were
sailing
and
he
knows
a
bit
about
elves
and
old
mr
bilbo
knew
more
many's
the
talk
I
had
with
him
when
I
was
a
little
lad'

'oh
they're
both
cracked'
said
ted
'leastways
old
bilbo
was
cracked
and
frodo's
cracking
if
that's
where
you
get
your
news
from
you'll
never
want
for
moonshine
well
friends
i'm
off
home
your
good
health'
he
drained
his
mug
and
went
out
noisily

sam
sat
silent
and
said
no
more
he
had
a
good
deal
to
think
about
for
one
thing
there
was
a
lot
to
do
up
in
the
bag
end
garden
and
he
would
have
a
busy
day
tomorrow
if
the
weather
cleared
the
grass
was
growing
fast
but
sam
had
more
on
his
mind
than
gardening
after
a
while
he
sighed
and
got
up
and
went
out

it
was
early
april
and
the
sky
was
now
clearing
after
heavy
rain
the
sun
was
down
and
a
cool
pale
evening
was
quietly
fading
into
night
he
walked
home
under
the
early
stars
through
hobbiton
and
up
the
hill
whistling
softly
and
thoughtfully

it
was
just
at
this
time
that
gandalf
reappeared
after
his
long
absence
for
three
years
after
the
party
he
had
been
away
then
he
paid
frodo
a
brief
visit
and
after
taking
a
good
look
at
him
he
went
off
again
during
the
next
year
or
two
he
had
turned
up
fairly
often
coming
unexpectedly
after
dusk
and
going
off
without
warning
before
sunrise
he
would
not
discuss
his
own
business
and
journeys
and
seemed
chiefly
interested
in
small
news
about
frodo's
health
and
doings

then
suddenly
his
visits
had
ceased
it
was
over
nine
years
since
frodo
had
seen
or
heard
of
him
and
he
had
begun
to
think
that
the
wizard
would
never
return
and
had
given
up
all
interest
in
hobbits
but
that
evening
as
sam
was
walking
home
and
twilight
was
fading
there
came
the
once
familiar
tap
on
the
study
window

frodo
welcomed
his
old
friend
with
surprise
and
great
delight
they
looked
hard
at
one
another

'ah
well
eh'
said
gandalf
'you
look
the
same
as
ever
frodo'

'so
do
you'
frodo
replied
but
secretly
he
thought
that
gandalf
looked
older
and
more
careworn
he
pressed
him
for
news
of
himself
and
of
the
wide
world
and
soon
they
were
deep
in
talk
and
they
stayed
up
far
into
the
night

next
morning
after
a
late
breakfast
the
wizard
was
sitting
with
frodo
by
the
open
window
of
the
study
a
bright
fire
was
on
the
hearth
but
the
sun
was
warm
and
the
wind
was
in
the
south
everything
looked
fresh
and
the
new
green
of
spring
was
shimmering
in
the
fields
and
on
the
tips
of
the
trees'
fingers

gandalf
was
thinking
of
a
spring
nearly
eighty
years
before
when
bilbo
had
run
out
of
bag
end
without
a
handkerchief
his
hair
was
perhaps
whiter
than
it
had
been
then
and
his
beard
and
eyebrows
were
perhaps
longer
and
his
face
more
lined
with
care
and
wisdom
but
his
eyes
were
as
bright
as
ever
and
he
smoked
and
blew
smokerings
with
the
same
vigour
and
delight

he
was
smoking
now
in
silence
for
frodo
was
sitting
still
deep
in
thought
even
in
the
light
of
morning
he
felt
the
dark
shadow
of
the
tidings
that
gandalf
had
brought
at
last
he
broke
the
silence

'last
night
you
began
to
tell
me
strange
things
about
my
ring
gandalf'
he
said
'and
then
you
stopped
because
you
said
that
such
matters
were
best
left
until
daylight
don't
you
think
you
had
better
finish
now
you
say
the
ring
is
dangerous
far
more
dangerous
than
I
guess
in
what
way'

'in
many
ways'
answered
the
wizard
it
is
far
more
powerful
than
I
ever
dared
to
think
at
first
so
powerful
that
in
the
end
it
would
utterly
overcome
anyone
of
mortal
race
who
possessed
it
it
would
possess
him


'in
eregion
long
ago
many
elvenrings
were
made
magic
rings
as
you
call
them
and
they
were
of
course
of
various
kinds
some
more
potent
and
some
less
the
lesser
rings
were
only
essays
in
the
craft
before
it
was
fullgrown
and
to
the
elvensmiths
they
were
but
trifles

yet
still
to
my
mind
dangerous
for
mortals
but
the
great
rings
the
rings
of
power
they
were
perilous

'a
mortal
frodo
who
keeps
one
of
the
great
rings
does
not
die
but
he
does
not
grow
or
obtain
more
life
he
merely
continues
until
at
last
every
minute
is
a
weariness
and
if
he
often
uses
the
ring
to
make
himself
invisible
he

fades

he
becomes
in
the
end
invisible
permanently
and
walks
in
the
twilight
under
the
eye
of
the
dark
power
that
rules
the
rings
yes
sooner
or
later

later
if
he
is
strong
or
wellmeaning
to
begin
with
but
neither
strength
nor
good
purpose
will
last

sooner
or
later
the
dark
power
will
devour
him'

'how
terrifying'
said
frodo
there
was
another
long
silence
the
sound
of
sam
gamgee
cutting
the
lawn
came
in
from
the
garden

'how
long
have
you
known
this'
asked
frodo
at
length
'and
how
much
did
bilbo
know'

'bilbo
knew
no
more
than
he
told
you
I
am
sure'
said
gandalf
'he
would
certainly
never
have
passed
on
to
you
anything
that
he
thought
would
be
a
danger
even
though
I
promised
to
look
after
you
he
thought
the
ring
was
very
beautiful
and
very
useful
at
need
and
if
anything
was
wrong
or
queer
it
was
himself
he
said
that
it
was
growing
on
his
mind
and
he
was
always
worrying
about
it
but
he
did
not
suspect
that
the
ring
itself
was
to
blame
though
he
had
found
out
that
the
thing
needed
looking
after
it
did
not
seem
always
of
the
same
size
or
weight
it
shrank
or
expanded
in
an
odd
way
and
might
suddenly
slip
off
a
finger
where
it
had
been
tight'

'yes
he
warned
me
of
that
in
his
last
letter'
said
frodo
'so
I
have
always
kept
it
on
its
chain'

'very
wise'
said
gandalf
'but
as
for
his
long
life
bilbo
never
connected
it
with
the
ring
at
all
he
took
all
the
credit
for
that
to
himself
and
he
was
very
proud
of
it
though
he
was
getting
restless
and
uneasy

thin
and
stretched

he
said
a
sign
that
the
ring
was
getting
control'

'how
long
have
you
known
all
this'
asked
frodo
again

'known'
said
gandalf
'i
have
known
much
that
only
the
wise
know
frodo
but
if
you
mean
known
about

this

ring
well
I
still
do
not

know
one
might
say
there
is
a
last
test
to
make
but
I
no
longer
doubt
my
guess

'when
did
I
first
begin
to
guess'
he
mused
searching
back
in
memory
'let
me
see

it
was
in
the
year
that
the
white
council
drove
the
dark
power
from
mirkwood
just
before
the
battle
of
five
armies
that
bilbo
found
his
ring
a
shadow
fell
on
my
heart
then
though
I
did
not
know
yet
what
I
feared
I
wondered
often
how
gollum
came
by
a
great
ring
as
plainly
it
was

that
at
least
was
clear
from
the
first
then
I
heard
bilbo's
strange
story
of
how
he
had
won
it
and
I
could
not
believe
it
when
I
at
last
got
the
truth
out
of
him
I
saw
at
once
that
he
had
been
trying
to
put
his
claim
to
the
ring
beyond
doubt
much
like
gollum
with
his
birthday
present
the
lies
were
too
much
alike
for
my
comfort
clearly
the
ring
had
an
unwholesome
power
that
set
to
work
on
its
keeper
at
once
that
was
the
first
real
warning
I
had
that
all
was
not
well
I
told
bilbo
often
that
such
rings
were
better
left
unused
but
he
resented
it
and
soon
got
angry
there
was
little
else
that
I
could
do
I
could
not
take
it
from
him
without
doing
greater
harm
and
I
had
no
right
to
do
so
anyway
I
could
only
watch
and
wait
I
might
perhaps
have
consulted
saruman
the
white
but
something
always
held
me
back'

'who
is
he'
asked
frodo
I
have
never
heard
of
him
before'

'maybe
not'
answered
gandalf
'hobbits
are
or
were
no
concern
of
his
yet
he
is
great
among
the
wise
he
is
the
chief
of
my
order
and
the
head
of
the
council
his
knowledge
is
deep
but
his
pride
has
grown
with
it
and
he
takes
ill
any
meddling
the
lore
of
the
elvenrings
great
and
small
is
his
province
he
has
long
studied
it
seeking
the
lost
secrets
of
their
making
but
when
the
rings
were
debated
in
the
council
all
that
he
would
reveal
to
us
of
his
ringlore
told
against
my
fears
so
my
doubt
slept

but
uneasily
still
I
watched
and
I
waited


'and
all
seemed
well
with
bilbo
and
the
years
passed
yes
they
passed
and
they
seemed
not
to
touch
him
he
showed
no
signs
of
age
the
shadow
fell
on
me
again
but
I
said
to
myself
after
all
he
comes
of
a
longlived
family
on
his
mother's
side
there
is
time
yet
wait

'and
I
waited
until
that
night
when
he
left
this
house
he
said
and
did
things
then
that
filled
me
with
a
fear
that
no
words
of
saruman
could
allay
I
knew
at
last
that
something
dark
and
deadly
was
at
work
and
I
have
spent
most
of
the
years
since
then
in
finding
out
the
truth
of
it'

'there
wasn't
any
permanent
harm
done
was
there'
asked
frodo
anxiously
'he
would
get
all
right
in
time
wouldn't
he
be
able
to
rest
in
peace
I
mean'

'he
felt
better
at
once'
said
gandalf
'but
there
is
only
one
power
in
this
world
that
knows
all
about
the
rings
and
their
effects
and
as
far
as
I
know
there
is
no
power
in
the
world
that
knows
all
about
hobbits
among
the
wise
I
am
the
only
one
that
goes
in
for
hobbitlore
an
obscure
branch
of
knowledge
but
full
of
surprises
soft
as
butter
they
can
be
and
yet
sometimes
as
tough
as
old
treeroots
I
think
it
likely
that
some
would
resist
the
rings
far
longer
than
most
of
the
wise
would
believe
I
don't
think
you
need
worry
about
bilbo

'of
course
he
possessed
the
ring
for
many
years
and
used
it
so
it
might
take
a
long
while
for
the
influence
to
wear
off

before
it
was
safe
for
him
to
see
it
again
for
instance
otherwise
he
might
live
on
for
years
quite
happily
just
stop
as
he
was
when
he
parted
with
it
for
he
gave
it
up
in
the
end
of
his
own
accord
an
important
point
no
I
was
not
troubled
about
dear
bilbo
any
more
once
he
had
let
the
thing
go
it
is
for

you

that
I
feel
responsible

'ever
since
bilbo
left
I
have
been
deeply
concerned
about
you
and
about
all
these
charming
absurd
helpless
hobbits
it
would
be
a
grievous
blow
to
the
world
if
the
dark
power
overcame
the
shire
if
all
your
kind
jolly
stupid
bolgers
hornblowers
boffins
bracegirdles
and
the
rest
not
to
mention
the
ridiculous
bagginses
became
enslaved'

frodo
shuddered
'but
why
should
we
be'
he
asked
'and
why
should
he
want
such
slaves'

'to
tell
you
the
truth'
replied
gandalf
'i
believe
that
hitherto


hitherto
mark
you

he
has
entirely
overlooked
the
existence
of
hobbits
you
should
be
thankful
but
your
safety
has
passed
he
does
not
need
you

he
has
many
more
useful
servants

but
he
won't
forget
you
again
and
hobbits
as
miserable
slaves
would
please
him
far
more
than
hobbits
happy
and
free
there
is
such
a
thing
as
malice
and
revenge'

'revenge'
said
frodo
'revenge
for
what
I
still
don't
understand
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
bilbo
and
myself
and
our
ring'

'it
has
everything
to
do
with
it'
said
gandalf
'you
do
not
know
the
real
peril
yet
but
you
shall
I
was
not
sure
of
it
myself
when
I
was
last
here
but
the
time
has
come
to
speak
give
me
the
ring
for
a
moment'

frodo
took
it
from
his
breechespocket
where
it
was
clasped
to
a
chain
that
hung
from
his
belt
he
unfastened
it
and
handed
it
slowly
to
the
wizard
it
felt
suddenly
very
heavy
as
if
either
it
or
frodo
himself
was
in
some
way
reluctant
for
gandalf
to
touch
it

gandalf
held
it
up
it
looked
to
be
made
of
pure
and
solid
gold
'can
you
see
any
markings
on
it'
he
asked

'no'
said
frodo
'there
are
none
it
is
quite
plain
and
it
never
shows
a
scratch
or
sign
of
wear'

'well
then
look'
to
frodo's
astonishment
and
distress
the
wizard
threw
it
suddenly
into
the
middle
of
a
glowing
corner
of
the
fire
frodo
gave
a
cry
and
groped
for
the
tongs
but
gandalf
held
him
back

'wait'
he
said
in
a
commanding
voice
giving
frodo
a
quick
look
from
under
his
bristling
brows

no
apparent
change
came
over
the
ring
after
a
while
gandalf
got
up
closed
the
shutters
outside
the
window
and
drew
the
curtains
the
room
became
dark
and
silent
though
the
clack
of
sam's
shears
now
nearer
to
the
windows
could
still
be
heard
faintly
from
the
garden
for
a
moment
the
wizard
stood
looking
at
the
fire
then
he
stooped
and
removed
the
ring
to
the
hearth
with
the
tongs
and
at
once
picked
it
up
frodo
gasped

it
is
quite
cool'
said
gandalf
'take
it'
frodo
received
it
on
his
shrinking
palm
it
seemed
to
have
become
thicker
and
heavier
than
ever

'hold
it
up'
said
gandalf
'and
look
closely'

as
frodo
did
so
he
now
saw
fine
lines
finer
than
the
finest
penstrokes
running
along
the
ring
outside
and
inside
lines
of
fire
that
seemed
to
form
the
letters
of
a
flowing
script
they
shone
piercingly
bright
and
yet
remote
as
if
out
of
a
great
depth

'i
cannot
read
the
fiery
letters'
said
frodo
in
a
quavering
voice

'no'
said
gandalf
'but
I
can
the
letters
are
elvish
of
an
ancient
mode
but
the
language
is
that
of
mordor
which
I
will
not
utter
here
but
this
in
the
common
tongue
is
what
is
said
close
enough


one
ring
to
rule
them
all
one
ring
to
find
them

one
ring
to
bring
them
all
and
in
the
darkness
bind
them


it
is
only
two
lines
of
a
verse
long
known
in
elvenlore


three
rings
for
the
elvenkings
under
the
sky

seven
for
the
dwarflords
in
their
halls
of
stone

nine
for
mortal
men
doomed
to
die

one
for
the
dark
lord
on
his
dark
throne

in
the
land
of
mordor
where
the
shadows
lie

one
ring
to
rule
them
all
one
ring
to
find
them

one
ring
to
bring
them
all
and
in
the
darkness
bind
them

in
the
land
of
mordor
where
the
shadows
lie'


he
paused
and
then
said
slowly
in
a
deep
voice
'this
is
the
masterring
the
one
ring
to
rule
them
all
this
is
the
one
ring
that
he
lost
many
ages
ago
to
the
great
weakening
of
his
power
he
greatly
desires
it

but
he
must

not

get
it'

frodo
sat
silent
and
motionless
fear
seemed
to
stretch
out
a
vast
hand
like
a
dark
cloud
rising
in
the
east
and
looming
up
to
engulf
him
'this
ring'
he
stammered
'how
how
on
earth
did
it
come
to
me'

'ah'
said
gandalf
'that
is
a
very
long
story
the
beginnings
lie
back
in
the
black
years
which
only
the
loremasters
now
remember
if
I
were
to
tell
you
all
that
tale
we
should
still
be
sitting
here
when
spring
had
passed
into
winter

'but
last
night
I
told
you
of
sauron
the
great
the
dark
lord
the
rumours
that
you
have
heard
are
true
he
has
indeed
arisen
again
and
left
his
hold
in
mirkwood
and
returned
to
his
ancient
fastness
in
the
dark
tower
of
mordor
that
name
even
you
hobbits
have
heard
of
like
a
shadow
on
the
borders
of
old
stories
always
after
a
defeat
and
a
respite
the
shadow
takes
another
shape
and
grows
again'

'i
wish
it
need
not
have
happened
in
my
time'
said
frodo

'so
do
i'
said
gandalf
'and
so
do
all
who
live
to
see
such
times
but
that
is
not
for
them
to
decide
all
we
have
to
decide
is
what
to
do
with
the
time
that
is
given
us
and
already
frodo
our
time
is
beginning
to
look
black
the
enemy
is
fast
becoming
very
strong
his
plans
are
far
from
ripe
I
think
but
they
are
ripening
we
shall
be
hard
put
to
it
we
should
be
very
hard
put
to
it
even
if
it
were
not
for
this
dreadful
chance


'the
enemy
still
lacks
one
thing
to
give
him
strength
and
knowledge
to
beat
down
all
resistance
break
the
last
defences
and
cover
all
the
lands
in
a
second
darkness
he
lacks
the
one
ring

'the
three
fairest
of
all
the
elflords
hid
from
him
and
his
hand
never
touched
them
or
sullied
them
seven
the
dwarfkings
possessed
but
three
he
has
recovered
and
the
others
the
dragons
have
consumed
nine
he
gave
to
mortal
men
proud
and
great
and
so
ensnared
them
long
ago
they
fell
under
the
dominion
of
the
one
and
they
became
ringwraiths
shadows
under
his
great
shadow
his
most
terrible
servants
long
ago
it
is
many
a
year
since
the
nine
walked
abroad
yet
who
knows
as
the
shadow
grows
once
more
they
too
may
walk
again
but
come
we
will
not
speak
of
such
things
even
in
the
morning
of
the
shire

'so
it
is
now
the
nine
he
has
gathered
to
himself
the
seven
also
or
else
they
are
destroyed
the
three
are
hidden
still
but
that
no
longer
troubles
him
he
only
needs
the
one
for
he
made
that
ring
himself
it
is
his
and
he
let
a
great
part
of
his
own
former
power
pass
into
it
so
that
he
could
rule
all
the
others
if
he
recovers
it
then
he
will
command
them
all
again
wherever
they
be
even
the
three
and
all
that
has
been
wrought
with
them
will
be
laid
bare
and
he
will
be
stronger
than
ever

'and
this
is
the
dreadful
chance
frodo
he
believed
that
the
one
had
perished
that
the
elves
had
destroyed
it
as
should
have
been
done
but
he
knows
now
that
it
has

not

perished
that
it
has
been
found
so
he
is
seeking
it
seeking
it
and
all
his
thought
is
bent
on
it
it
is
his
great
hope
and
our
great
fear'

'why
why
wasn't
it
destroyed'
cried
frodo
'and
how
did
the
enemy
ever
come
to
lose
it
if
he
was
so
strong
and
it
was
so
precious
to
him'
he
clutched
the
ring
in
his
hand
as
if
he
saw
already
dark
fingers
stretching
out
to
seize
it

'it
was
taken
from
him'
said
gandalf
'the
strength
of
the
elves
to
resist
him
was
greater
long
ago
and
not
all
men
were
estranged
from
them
the
men
of
westernesse
came
to
their
aid
that
is
a
chapter
of
ancient
history
which
it
might
be
good
to
recall
for
there
was
sorrow
then
too
and
gathering
dark
but
great
valour
and
great
deeds
that
were
not
wholly
vain
one
day
perhaps
I
will
tell
you
all
the
tale
or
you
shall
hear
it
told
in
full
by
one
who
knows
it
best

'but
for
the
moment
since
most
of
all
you
need
to
know
how
this
thing
came
to
you
and
that
will
be
tale
enough
this
is
all
that
I
will
say
it
was
gilgalad
elvenking
and
elendil
of
westernesse
who
overthrew
sauron
though
they
themselves
perished
in
the
deed
and
isildur
elendil's
son
cut
the
ring
from
sauron's
hand
and
took
it
for
his
own
then
sauron
was
vanquished
and
his
spirit
fled
and
was
hidden
for
long
years
until
his
shadow
took
shape
again
in
mirkwood

'but
the
ring
was
lost
it
fell
into
the
great
river
anduin
and
vanished
for
isildur
was
marching
north
along
the
east
banks
of
the
river
and
near
the
gladden
fields
he
was
waylaid
by
the
orcs
of
the
mountains
and
almost
all
his
folk
were
slain
he
leaped
into
the
waters
but
the
ring
slipped
from
his
finger
as
he
swam
and
then
the
orcs
saw
him
and
killed
him
with
arrows'

gandalf
paused
'and
there
in
the
dark
pools
amid
the
gladden
fields'
he
said
'the
ring
passed
out
of
knowledge
and
legend
and
even
so
much
of
its
history
is
known
now
only
to
a
few
and
the
council
of
the
wise
could
discover
no
more
but
at
last
I
can
carry
on
the
story
I
think

'long
after
but
still
very
long
ago
there
lived
by
the
banks
of
the
great
river
on
the
edge
of
wilderland
a
cleverhanded
and
quietfooted
little
people
I
guess
they
were
of
hobbitkind
akin
to
the
fathers
of
the
fathers
of
the
stoors
for
they
loved
the
river
and
often
swam
in
it
or
made
little
boats
of
reeds
there
was
among
them
a
family
of
high
repute
for
it
was
large
and
wealthier
than
most
and
it
was
ruled
by
a
grandmother
of
the
folk
stern
and
wise
in
old
lore
such
as
they
had
the
most
inquisitive
and
curiousminded
of
that
family
was
called
smagol
he
was
interested
in
roots
and
beginnings
he
dived
into
deep
pools
he
burrowed
under
trees
and
growing
plants
he
tunnelled
into
green
mounds
and
he
ceased
to
look
up
at
the
hilltops
or
the
leaves
on
trees
or
the
flowers
opening
in
the
air
his
head
and
his
eyes
were
downward


'he
had
a
friend
called
dagol
of
similar
sort
sharpereyed
but
not
so
quick
and
strong
on
a
time
they
took
a
boat
and
went
down
to
the
gladden
fields
where
there
were
great
beds
of
iris
and
flowering
reeds
there
smagol
got
out
and
went
nosing
about
the
banks
but
deal
sat
in
the
boat
and
fished
suddenly
a
great
fish
took
his
hook
and
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
was
dragged
out
and
down
into
the
water
to
the
bottom
then
he
let
go
of
his
line
for
he
thought
he
saw
something
shining
in
the
riverbed
and
holding
his
breath
he
grabbed
at
it

'then
up
he
came
spluttering
with
weeds
in
his
hair
and
a
handful
of
mud
and
he
swam
to
the
bank
and
behold
when
he
washed
the
mud
away
there
in
his
hand
lay
a
beautiful
golden
ring
and
it
shone
and
glittered
in
the
sun
so
that
his
heart
was
glad
but
smagol
had
been
watching
him
from
behind
a
tree
and
as
deal
gloated
over
the
ring
smagol
came
softly
up
behind

'give
us
that
deal
my
love
said
smagol
over
his
friend's
shoulder

'why
said
deal

'
because
it's
my
birthday
my
love
and
I
wants
it
said
smagol

'i
don't
care
said
deal
I
have
given
you
a
present
already
more
than
I
could
afford
I
found
this
and
i'm
going
to
keep
it

'
oh
are
you
indeed
my
love
said
smagol
and
he
caught
deal
by
the
throat
and
strangled
him
because
the
gold
looked
so
bright
and
beautiful
then
he
put
the
ring
on
his
finger

'no
one
ever
found
out
what
had
become
of
deal
he
was
murdered
far
from
home
and
his
body
was
cunningly
hidden
but
smagol
returned
alone
and
he
found
that
none
of
his
family
could
see
him
when
he
was
wearing
the
ring
he
was
very
pleased
with
his
discovery
and
he
concealed
it
and
he
used
it
to
find
out
secrets
and
he
put
his
knowledge
to
crooked
and
malicious
uses
he
became
sharpeyed
and
keeneared
for
all
that
was
hurtful
the
ring
had
given
him
power
according
to
his
stature
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
he
became
very
unpopular
and
was
shunned
when
visible
by
all
his
relations
they
kicked
him
and
he
bit
their
feet
he
took
to
thieving
and
going
about
muttering
to
himself
and
gurgling
in
his
throat
so
they
called
him

gollum

and
cursed
him
and
told
him
to
go
far
away
and
his
grandmother
desiring
peace
expelled
him
from
the
family
and
turned
him
out
of
her
hole

'he
wandered
in
loneliness
weeping
a
little
for
the
hardness
of
the
world
and
he
journeyed
up
the
river
till
he
came
to
a
stream
that
flowed
down
from
the
mountains
and
he
went
that
way
he
caught
fish
in
deep
pools
with
invisible
fingers
and
ate
them
raw
one
day
it
was
very
hot
and
as
he
was
bending
over
a
pool
he
felt
a
burning
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
dazzling
light
from
the
water
pained
his
wet
eyes
he
wondered
at
it
for
he
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
sun
then
for
the
last
time
he
looked
up
and
shook
his
fist
at
her

'but
as
he
lowered
his
eyes
he
saw
far
above
the
tops
of
the
misty
mountains
out
of
which
the
stream
came
and
he
thought
suddenly
it
would
be
cool
and
shady
under
those
mountains
the
sun
could
not
watch
me
there
the
roots
of
those
mountains
must
be
roots
indeed
there
must
be
great
secrets
buried
there
which
have
not
been
discovered
since
the
beginning

'so
he
journeyed
by
night
up
into
the
highlands
and
he
found
a
little
cave
out
of
which
the
dark
stream
ran
and
he
wormed
his
way
like
a
maggot
into
the
heart
of
the
hills
and
vanished
out
of
all
knowledge
the
ring
went
into
the
shadows
with
him
and
even
the
maker
when
his
power
had
begun
to
grow
again
could
learn
nothing
of
it'

'gollum'
cried
frodo
'gollum
do
you
mean
that
this
is
the
very
gollumcreature
that
bilbo
met
how
loathsome'

'i
think
it
is
a
sad
story'
said
the
wizard
'and
it
might
have
happened
to
others
even
to
some
hobbits
that
I
have
known'

'i
can't
believe
that
gollum
was
connected
with
hobbits
however
distantly'
said
frodo
with
some
heat
'what
an
abominable
notion'

'it
is
true
all
the
same'
replied
gandalf
'about
their
origins
at
any
rate
I
know
more
than
hobbits
do
themselves
and
even
bilbo's
story
suggests
the
kinship
there
was
a
great
deal
in
the
background
of
their
minds
and
memories
that
was
very
similar
they
understood
one
another
remarkably
well
very
much
better
than
a
hobbit
would
understand
say
a
dwarf
or
an
orc
or
even
an
elf
think
of
the
riddles
they
both
knew
for
one
thing'

'yes'
said
frodo
'though
other
folks
besides
hobbits
ask
riddles
and
of
much
the
same
sort
and
hobbits
don't
cheat
gollum
meant
to
cheat
all
the
time
he
was
just
trying
to
put
poor
bilbo
off
his
guard
and
I
daresay
it
amused
his
wickedness
to
start
a
game
which
might
end
in
providing
him
with
an
easy
victim
but
if
he
lost
would
not
hurt
him'

'only
too
true
I
fear'
said
gandalf
'but
there
was
something
else
in
it
I
think
which
you
don't
see
yet
even
gollum
was
not
wholly
ruined
he
had
proved
tougher
than
even
one
of
the
wise
would
have
guessed
as
a
hobbit
might
there
was
a
little
corner
of
his
mind
that
was
still
his
own
and
light
came
through
it
as
through
a
chink
in
the
dark
light
out
of
the
past
it
was
actually
pleasant
I
think
to
hear
a
kindly
voice
again
bringing
up
memories
of
wind
and
trees
and
sun
on
the
grass
and
such
forgotten
things

'but
that
of
course
would
only
make
the
evil
part
of
him
angrier
in
the
end

unless
it
could
be
conquered
unless
it
could
be
cured'
gandalf
sighed
'alas
there
is
little
hope
of
that
for
him
yet
not
no
hope
no
not
though
he
possessed
the
ring
so
long
almost
as
far
back
as
he
can
remember
for
it
was
long
since
he
had
worn
it
much
in
the
black
darkness
it
was
seldom
needed
certainly
he
had
never
faded
he
is
thin
and
tough
still
but
the
thing
was
eating
up
his
mind
of
course
and
the
torment
had
become
almost
unbearable

'all
the
great
secrets
under
the
mountains
had
turned
out
to
be
just
empty
night
there
was
nothing
more
to
find
out
nothing
worth
doing
only
nasty
furtive
eating
and
resentful
remembering
he
was
altogether
wretched
he
hated
the
dark
and
he
hated
light
more
he
hated
everything
and
the
ring
most
of
all'

'what
do
you
mean'
said
frodo
'surely
the
ring
was
his
precious
and
the
only
thing
he
cared
for
but
if
he
hated
it
why
didn't
he
get
rid
of
it
or
go
away
and
leave
it'

'you
ought
to
begin
to
understand
frodo
after
all
you
have
heard'
said
gandalf
'he
hated
it
and
loved
it
as
he
hated
and
loved
himself
he
could
not
get
rid
of
it
he
had
no
will
left
in
the
matter

'a
ring
of
power
looks
after
itself
frodo

it

may
slip
off
treacherously
but
its
keeper
never
abandons
it
at
most
he
plays
with
the
idea
of
handing
it
on
to
someone
else's
care

and
that
only
at
an
early
stage
when
it
first
begins
to
grip
but
as
far
as
I
know
bilbo
alone
in
history
has
ever
gone
beyond
playing
and
really
done
it
he
needed
all
my
help
too
and
even
so
he
would
never
have
just
forsaken
it
or
cast
it
aside
it
was
not
gollum
frodo
but
the
ring
itself
that
decided
things
the
ring
left

him'


'what
just
in
time
to
meet
bilbo'
said
frodo
'wouldn't
an
orc
have
suited
it
better'

'it
is
no
laughing
matter'
said
gandalf
'not
for
you
it
was
the
strangest
event
in
the
whole
history
of
the
ring
so
far
bilbo's
arrival
just
at
that
time
and
putting
his
hand
on
it
blindly
in
the
dark

'there
was
more
than
one
power
at
work
frodo
the
ring
was
trying
to
get
back
to
its
master
it
had
slipped
from
isildur's
hand
and
betrayed
him
then
when
a
chance
came
it
caught
poor
deal
and
he
was
murdered
and
after
that
gollum
and
it
had
devoured
him
it
could
make
no
further
use
of
him
he
was
too
small
and
mean
and
as
long
as
it
stayed
with
him
he
would
never
leave
his
deep
pool
again
so
now
when
its
master
was
awake
once
more
and
sending
out
his
dark
thought
from
mirkwood
it
abandoned
gollum
only
to
be
picked
up
by
the
most
unlikely
person
imaginable
bilbo
from
the
shire

'behind
that
there
was
something
else
at
work
beyond
any
design
of
the
ringmaker
I
can
put
it
no
plainer
than
by
saying
that
bilbo
was

meant
to
find
the
ring
and

not

by
its
maker
in
which
case
you
also
were

meant
to
have
it
and
that
maybe
an
encouraging
thought'

it
is
not'
said
frodo
though
I
am
not
sure
that
I
understand
you
but
how
have
you
learned
all
this
about
the
ring
and
about
gollum
do
you
really
know
it
all
or
are
you
just
guessing
still'


gandalf
looked
at
frodo
and
his
eyes
glinted
I
knew
much
and
I
have
learned
much'
he
answered
'but
I
am
not
going
to
give
an
account
of
all
my
doings
to

you

the
history
of
elendil
and
isildur
and
the
one
ring
is
known
to
all
the
wise
your
ring
is
shown
to
be
that
one
ring
by
the
firewriting
alone
apart
from
any
other
evidence'
'and
when
did
you
discover
that'
asked
frodo
interrupting
'just
now
in
this
room
of
course'
answered
the
wizard
sharply
'but
I
expected
to
find
it
I
have
come
back
from
dark
journeys
and
long
search
to
make
that
final
test
it
is
the
last
proof
and
all
is
now
only
too
clear
making
out
gollum's
part
and
fitting
it
into
the
gap
in
the
history
required
some
thought
I
may
have
started
with
guesses
about
gollum
but
I
am
not
guessing
now
I
know
I
have
seen
him'

'you
have
seen
gollum'
exclaimed
frodo
in
amazement

'yes
the
obvious
thing
to
do
of
course
if
one
could
I
tried
long
ago
but
I
have
managed
it
at
last'

'then
what
happened
after
bilbo
escaped
from
him
do
you
know
that'

'not
so
clearly
what
I
have
told
you
is
what
gollum
was
willing
to
tell

though
not
of
course
in
the
way
I
have
reported
it
gollum
is
a
liar
and
you
have
to
sift
his
words
for
instance
he
called
the
ring
his
birthday
present
and
he
stuck
to
that
he
said
it
came
from
his
grandmother
who
had
lots
of
beautiful
things
of
that
kind
a
ridiculous
story
I
have
no
doubt
that
smagol's
grandmother
was
a
matriarch
a
great
person
in
her
way
but
to
talk
of
her
possessing
many
elvenrings
was
absurd
and
as
for
giving
them
away
it
was
a
lie
but
a
lie
with
a
grain
of
truth

'the
murder
of
deal
haunted
gollum
and
he
had
made
up
a
defence
repeating
it
to
his
precious
over
and
over
again
as
he
gnawed
bones
in
the
dark
until
he
almost
believed
it
it

was

his
birthday
deal
ought
to
have
given
the
ring
to
him
it
had
previously
turned
up
just
so
as
to
be
a
present
it

was

his
birthday
present
and
so
on
and
on

I
endured
him
as
long
as
I
could
but
the
truth
was
desperately
important
and
in
the
end
I
had
to
be
harsh
I
put
the
fear
of
fire
on
him
and
wrung
the
true
story
out
of
him
bit
by
bit
together
with
much
snivelling
and
snarling
he
thought
he
was
misunderstood
and
illused
but
when
he
had
at
last
told
me
his
history
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
riddlegame
and
bilbo's
escape
he
would
not
say
any
more
except
in
dark
hints
some
other
fear
was
on
him
greater
than
mine
he
muttered
that
he
was
going
to
gel
his
own
back
people
would
see
if
he
would
stand
being
kicked
and
driven
into
a
hole
and
then

robbed

gollum
had
good
friends
now
good
friends
and
very
strong
they
would
help
him
baggins
would
pay
for
it
that
was
his
chief
thought
he
hated
bilbo
and
cursed
his
name
what
is
more
he
knew
where
he
came
from'

'but
how
did
he
find
that
out'
asked
frodo

'well
as
for
the
name
bilbo
very
foolishly
told
gollum
himself
and
after
that
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
discover
his
country
once
gollum
came
out
oh
yes
he
came
out
his
longing
for
the
ring
proved
stronger
than
his
fear
of
the
orcs
or
even
of
the
light
after
a
year
or
two
he
left
the
mountains
you
see
though
still
bound
by
desire
of
it
the
ring
was
no
longer
devouring
him
he
began
to
revive
a
little
he
felt
old
terribly
old
yet
less
timid
and
he
was
mortally
hungry

'light
light
of
sun
and
moon
he
still
feared
and
hated
and
he
always
will
I
think
but
he
was
cunning
he
found
he
could
hide
from
daylight
and
moonshine
and
make
his
way
swiftly
and
softly
by
dead
of
night
with
his
pale
cold
eyes
and
catch
small
frightened
or
unwary
things
he
grew
stronger
and
bolder
with
new
food
and
new
air
he
found
his
way
into
mirkwood
as
one
would
expect'

'is
that
where
you
found
him'
asked
frodo

'i
saw
him
there'
answered
gandalf
'but
before
that
he
had
wandered
far
following
bilbo's
trail
it
was
difficult
to
learn
anything
from
him
for
certain
for
his
talk
was
constantly
interrupted
by
curses
and
threats
what
had
it
got
in
its
pocketses
he
said
it
wouldn't
say
no
precious
little
cheat
not
a
fair
question
it
cheated
first
it
did
it
broke
the
rules
we
ought
to
have
squeezed
it
yes
precious
and
we
will
precious


'that
is
a
sample
of
his
talk
I
don't
suppose
you
want
any
more
I
had
weary
days
of
it
but
from
hints
dropped
among
the
snarls
I
even
gathered
that
his
padding
feet
had
taken
him
at
last
to
esgaroth
and
even
to
the
streets
of
dale
listening
secretly
and
peering
well
the
news
of
the
great
events
went
far
and
wide
in
wilderland
and
many
had
heard
bilbo's
name
and
knew
where
he
came
from
we
had
made
no
secret
of
our
return
journey
to
his
home
in
the
west
gollum's
sharp
ears
would
soon
learn
what
he
wanted'

'then
why
didn't
he
track
bilbo
further'
asked
frodo
'why
didn't
he
come
to
the
shire'

'ah'
said
gandalf
'now
we
come
to
it
I
think
gollum
tried
to
he
set
out
and
came
back
westward
as
far
as
the
great
river
but
then
he
turned
aside
he
was
not
daunted
by
the
distance
I
am
sure
no
something
else
drew
him
away
so
my
friends
think
those
that
hunted
him
for
me

'the
woodelves
tracked
him
first
an
easy
task
for
them
for
his
trail
was
still
fresh
then
through
mirkwood
and
back
again
it
led
them
though
they
never
caught
him
the
wood
was
full
of
the
rumour
of
him
dreadful
tales
even
among
beasts
and
birds
the
woodmen
said
that
there
was
some
new
terror
abroad
a
ghost
that
drank
blood
it
climbed
trees
to
find
nests
it
crept
into
holes
to
find
the
young
it
slipped
through
windows
to
find
cradles

'but
at
the
western
edge
of
mirkwood
the
trail
turned
away
it
wandered
off
southwards
and
passed
out
of
the
woodelves'
ken
and
was
lost
and
then
I
made
a
great
mistake
yes
frodo
and
not
the
first
though
I
fear
it
may
prove
the
worst
I
let
the
matter
be
I
let
him
go
for
I
had
much
else
to
think
of
at
that
time
and
I
still
trusted
the
lore
of
saruman

'well
that
was
years
ago
I
have
paid
for
it
since
with
many
dark
and
dangerous
days
the
trail
was
long
cold
when
I
took
it
up
again
after
bilbo
left
here
and
my
search
would
have
been
in
vain
but
for
the
help
that
I
had
from
a
friend
aragorn
the
greatest
traveller
and
huntsman
of
this
age
of
the
world
together
we
sought
for
gollum
down
the
whole
length
of
wilderland
without
hope
and
without
success
but
at
last
when
I
had
given
up
the
chase
and
turned
to
other
parts
gollum
was
found
my
friend
returned
out
of
the
great
perils
bringing
the
miserable
creature
with
him

'what
he
had
been
doing
he
would
not
say
he
only
wept
and
called
us
cruel
with
many
a

gollum

in
his
throat
and
when
we
pressed
him
he
whined
and
cringed
and
rubbed
his
long
hands
licking
his
fingers
as
if
they
pained
him
as
if
he
remembered
some
old
torture
but
I
am
afraid
there
is
no
possible
doubt
he
had
made
his
slow
sneaking
way
step
by
step
mile
by
mile
south
down
at
last
to
the
land
of
mordor'

a
heavy
silence
fell
in
the
room
frodo
could
hear
his
heart
beating
even
outside
everything
seemed
still
no
sound
of
sam's
shears
could
now
be
heard

'yes
to
mordor'
said
gandalf
'alas
mordor
draws
all
wicked
things
and
the
dark
power
was
bending
all
its
will
to
gather
them
there
the
ring
of
the
enemy
would
leave
its
mark
too
leave
him
open
to
the
summons
and
all
folk
were
whispering
then
of
the
new
shadow
in
the
south
and
its
hatred
of
the
west
there
were
his
fine
new
friends
who
would
help
him
in
his
revenge

'wretched
fool
in
that
land
he
would
learn
much
too
much
for
his
comfort
and
sooner
or
later
as
he
lurked
and
pried
on
the
borders
he
would
be
caught
and
taken

for
examination
that
was
the
way
of
it
I
fear
when
he
was
found
he
had
already
been
there
long
and
was
on
his
way
back
on
some
errand
of
mischief
but
that
does
not
matter
much
now
his
worst
mischief
was
done

'yes
alas
through
him
the
enemy
has
learned
that
the
one
has
been
found
again
he
knows
where
isildur
fell
he
knows
where
gollum
found
his
ring
he
knows
that
it
is
a
great
ring
for
it
gave
long
life
he
knows
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
three
for
they
have
never
been
lost
and
they
endure
no
evil
he
knows
that
it
is
not
one
of
the
seven
or
the
nine
for
they
are
accounted
for
he
knows
that
it
is
the
one
and
he
has
at
last
heard
I
think
of

hobbits

and
the

shire


'the
shire

he
may
be
seeking
for
it
now
if
he
has
not
already
found
out
where
it
lies
indeed
frodo
I
fear
that
he
may
even
think
that
the
longunnoticed
name
of

baggins

has
become
important'


'but
this
is
terrible'
cried
frodo
'far
worse
than
the
worst
that
I
imagined
from
your
hints
and
warnings
o
gandalf
best
of
friends
what
am
I
to
do
for
now
I
am
really
afraid
what
am
I
to
do
what
a
pity
that
bilbo
did
not
stab
that
vile
creature
when
he
had
a
chance'

'pity
it
was
pity
that
stayed
his
hand
pity
and
mercy
not
to
strike
without
need
and
he
has
been
well
rewarded
frodo
be
sure
that
he
took
so
little
hurt
from
the
evil
and
escaped
in
the
end
because
he
began
his
ownership
of
the
ring
so
with
pity'

'i
am
sorry'
said
frodo
'but
I
am
frightened
and
I
do
not
feel
any
pity
for
gollum'

'you
have
not
seen
him'
gandalf
broke
in

'no
and
I
don't
want
to'
said
frodo
I
can't
understand
you
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
and
the
elves
have
let
him
live
on
after
all
those
horrible
deeds
now
at
any
rate
he
is
as
bad
as
an
orc
and
just
an
enemy
he
deserves
death'

'deserves
it
I
daresay
he
does
many
that
live
deserve
death
and
some
that
die
deserve
life
can
you
give
it
to
them
then
do
not
be
too
eager
to
deal
out
death
in
judgement
for
even
the
very
wise
cannot
see
all
ends
I
have
not
much
hope
that
gollum
can
be
cured
before
he
dies
but
there
is
a
chance
of
it
and
he
is
bound
up
with
the
fate
of
the
ring
my
heart
tells
me
that
he
has
some
part
to
play
yet
for
good
or
ill
before
the
end
and
when
that
comes
the
pity
of
bilbo
may
rule
the
fate
of
many

yours
not
least
in
any
case
we
did
not
kill
him
he
is
very
old
and
very
wretched
the
woodelves
have
him
in
prison
but
they
treat
him
with
such
kindness
as
they
can
find
in
their
wise
hearts'

'all
the
same'
said
frodo
'even
if
bilbo
could
not
kill
gollum
I
wish
he
had
not
kept
the
ring
I
wish
he
had
never
found
it
and
that
I
had
not
got
it
why
did
you
let
me
keep
it
why
didn't
you
make
me
throw
it
away
or
or
destroy
it'

'let
you
make
you'
said
the
wizard
'haven't
you
been
listening
to
all
that
I
have
said
you
are
not
thinking
of
what
you
are
saying
but
as
for
throwing
it
away
that
was
obviously
wrong
these
rings
have
a
way
of
being
found
in
evil
hands
it
might
have
done
great
evil
worst
of
all
it
might
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
indeed
it
certainly
would
for
this
is
the
one
and
he
is
exerting
all
his
power
to
find
it
or
draw
it
to
himself

'of
course
my
dear
frodo
it
was
dangerous
for
you
and
that
has
troubled
me
deeply
but
there
was
so
much
at
stake
that
I
had
to
take
some
risk

though
even
when
I
was
far
away
there
has
never
been
a
day
when
the
shire
has
not
been
guarded
by
watchful
eyes
as
long
as
you
never
used
it
I
did
not
think
that
the
ring
would
have
any
lasting
effect
on
you
not
for
evil
not
at
any
rate
for
a
very
long
time
and
you
must
remember
that
nine
years
ago
when
I
last
saw
you
I
still
knew
little
for
certain'

'but
why
not
destroy
it
as
you
say
should
have
been
done
long
ago'
cried
frodo
again
if
you
had
warned
me
or
even
sent
me
a
message
I
would
have
done
away
with
it'

'would
you
how
would
you
do
that
have
you
ever
tried'

'no
but
I
suppose
one
could
hammer
it
or
melt
it'

'try'
said
gandalf
try
now'

frodo
drew
the
ring
out
of
his
pocket
again
and
looked
at
it
it
now
appeared
plain
and
smooth
without
mark
or
device
that
he
could
see
the
gold
looked
very
fair
and
pure
and
frodo
thought
how
rich
and
beautiful
was
its
colour
how
perfect
was
its
roundness
it
was
an
admirable
thing
and
altogether
precious
when
he
took
it
out
he
had
intended
to
fling
it
from
him
into
the
very
hottest
part
of
the
fire
but
he
found
now
that
he
could
not
do
so
not
without
a
great
struggle
he
weighed
the
ring
in
his
hand
hesitating
and
forcing
himself
to
remember
all
that
gandalf
had
told
him
and
then
with
an
effort
of
will
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
cast
it
away

but
he
found
that
he
had
put
it
back
in
his
pocket

gandalf
laughed
grimly
'you
see
already
you
too
frodo
cannot
easily
let
it
go
nor
will
to
damage
it
and
I
could
not
make
you

except
by
force
which
would
break
your
mind
but
as
for
breaking
the
ring
force
is
useless
even
if
you
took
it
and
struck
it
with
a
heavy
sledgehammer
it
would
make
no
dint
in
it
it
cannot
be
unmade
by
your
hands
or
by
mine


'your
small
fire
of
course
would
not
melt
even
ordinary
gold
this
ring
has
already
passed
through
it
unscathed
and
even
unheated
but
there
is
no
smith's
forge
in
this
shire
that
could
change
it
at
all
not
even
the
anvils
and
furnaces
of
the
dwarves
could
do
that
it
has
been
said
that
dragonfire
could
melt
and
consume
the
rings
of
power
but
there
is
not
now
any
dragon
left
on
earth
in
which
the
old
fire
is
hot
enough
nor
was
there
ever
any
dragon
not
even
ancalagon
the
black
who
could
have
harmed
the
one
ring
the
ruling
ring
for
that
was
made
by
sauron
himself
there
is
only
one
way
to
find
the
cracks
of
doom
in
the
depths
of
orodruin
the
firemountain
and
cast
the
ring
in
there
if
you
really
wish
to
destroy
it
to
put
it
beyond
the
grasp
of
the
enemy
for
ever'

'i
do
really
wish
to
destroy
it'
cried
frodo
'or
well
to
have
it
destroyed
I
am
not
made
for
perilous
quests
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
the
ring
why
did
it
come
to
me
why
was
I
chosen'

'such
questions
cannot
be
answered'
said
gandalf
'you
may
be
sure
that
it
was
not
for
any
merit
that
others
do
not
possess
not
for
power
or
wisdom
at
any
rate
but
you
have
been
chosen
and
you
must
therefore
use
such
strength
and
heart
and
wits
as
you
have'

'but
I
have
so
little
of
any
of
these
things
you
are
wise
and
powerful
will
you
not
take
the
ring'

'no'
cried
gandalf
springing
to
his
feet
'with
that
power
I
should
have
power
too
great
and
terrible
and
over
me
the
ring
would
gain
a
power
still
greater
and
more
deadly'
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
face
was
lit
as
by
a
fire
within
'do
not
tempt
me
for
I
do
not
wish
to
become
like
the
dark
lord
himself
yet
the
way
of
the
ring
to
my
heart
is
by
pity
pity
for
weakness
and
the
desire
of
strength
to
do
good
do
not
tempt
me
I
dare
not
take
it
not
even
to
keep
it
safe
unused
the
wish
to
wield
it
would
be
too
great
for
my
strength
I
shall
have
such
need
of
it
great
perils
lie
before
me'

he
went
to
the
window
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
and
the
shutters
sunlight
streamed
back
again
into
the
room
sam
passed
along
the
path
outside
whistling
'and
now'
said
the
wizard
turning
back
to
frodo
'the
decision
lies
with
you
but
I
will
always
help
you'
he
laid
his
hand
on
frodo's
shoulder
'i
will
help
you
bear
this
burden
as
long
as
it
is
yours
to
bear
but
we
must
do
something
soon
the
enemy
is
moving'

there
was
a
long
silence
gandalf
sat
down
again
and
puffed
at
his
pipe
as
if
lost
in
thought
his
eyes
seemed
closed
but
under
the
lids
he
was
watching
frodo
intently
frodo
gazed
fixedly
at
the
red
embers
on
the
hearth
until
they
filled
all
his
vision
and
he
seemed
to
be
looking
down
into
profound
wells
of
fire
he
was
thinking
of
the
fabled
cracks
of
doom
and
the
terror
of
the
fiery
mountain

'well'
said
gandalf
at
last
'what
are
you
thinking
about
have
you
decided
what
to
do'

'no'
answered
frodo
coming
back
to
himself
out
of
darkness
and
finding
to
his
surprise
that
it
was
not
dark
and
that
out
of
the
window
he
could
see
the
sunlit
garden
'or
perhaps
yes
as
far
as
I
understand
what
you
have
said
I
suppose
I
must
keep
the
ring
and
guard
it
at
least
for
the
present
whatever
it
may
do
to
me'

'whatever
it
may
do
it
will
be
slow
slow
to
evil
if
you
keep
it
with
that
purpose'
said
gandalf

'i
hope
so'
said
frodo
'but
I
hope
that
you
may
find
some
other
better
keeper
soon
but
in
the
meanwhile
it
seems
that
I
am
a
danger
a
danger
to
all
that
live
near
me
I
cannot
keep
the
ring
and
stay
here
I
ought
to
leave
bag
end
leave
the
shire
leave
everything
and
go
away'
he
sighed

'i
should
like
to
save
the
shire
if
I
could

though
there
have
been
times
when
I
thought
the
inhabitants
too
stupid
and
dull
for
words
and
have
felt
that
an
earthquake
or
an
invasion
of
dragons
might
be
good
for
them
but
I
don't
feel
like
that
now
I
feel
that
as
long
as
the
shire
lies
behind
safe
and
comfortable
I
shall
find
wandering
more
bearable
I
shall
know
that
somewhere
there
is
a
firm
foothold
even
if
my
feet
cannot
stand
there
again

'of
course
I
have
sometimes
thought
of
going
away
but
I
imagined
that
as
a
kind
of
holiday
a
series
of
adventures
like
bilbo's
or
better
ending
in
peace
but
this
would
mean
exile
a
flight
from
danger
into
danger
drawing
it
after
me
and
I
suppose
I
must
go
alone
if
I
am
to
do
that
and
save
the
shire
but
I
feel
very
small
and
very
uprooted
and
well

desperate
the
enemy
is
so
strong
and
terrible'

he
did
not
tell
gandalf
but
as
he
was
speaking
a
great
desire
to
follow
bilbo
flamed
up
in
his
heart

to
follow
bilbo
and
even
perhaps
to
find
him
again
it
was
so
strong
that
it
overcame
his
fear
he
could
almost
have
run
out
there
and
then
down
the
road
without
his
hat
as
bilbo
had
done
on
a
similar
morning
long
ago

'my
dear
frodo'
exclaimed
gandalf
'hobbits
really
are
amazing
creatures
as
I
have
said
before
you
can
learn
all
that
there
is
to
know
about
their
ways
in
a
month
and
yet
after
a
hundred
years
they
can
still
surprise
you
at
a
pinch
I
hardly
expected
to
get
such
an
answer
not
even
from
you
but
bilbo
made
no
mistake
in
choosing
his
heir
though
he
little
thought
how
important
it
would
prove
I
am
afraid
you
are
right
the
ring
will
not
be
able
to
stay
hidden
in
the
shire
much
longer
and
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
others
you
will
have
to
go
and
leave
the
name
of
baggins
behind
you
that
name
will
not
be
safe
to
have
outside
the
shire
or
in
the
wild
I
will
give
you
a
travelling
name
now
when
you
go
go
as
mr
underhill

'but
I
don't
think
you
need
go
alone
not
if
you
know
of
anyone
you
can
trust
and
who
would
be
willing
to
go
by
your
side

and
that
you
would
be
willing
to
take
into
unknown
perils
but
if
you
look
for
a
companion
be
careful
in
choosing
and
be
careful
of
what
you
say
even
to
your
closest
friends
the
enemy
has
many
spies
and
many
ways
of
hearing'

suddenly
he
stopped
as
if
listening
frodo
became
aware
that
all
was
very
quiet
inside
and
outside
gandalf
crept
to
one
side
of
the
window
then
with
a
dart
he
sprang
to
the
sill
and
thrust
a
long
arm
out
and
downwards
there
was
a
squawk
and
up
came
sam
gamgee's
curly
head
hauled
by
one
ear

'well
well
bless
my
beard'
said
gandalf
'sam
gamgee
is
it
now
what
may
you
be
doing'

'lor
bless
you
mr
gandalf
sir'
said
sam
'nothing
leastways
I
was
just
trimming
the
grassborder
under
the
window
if
you
follow
me'
he
picked
up
his
shears
and
exhibited
them
as
evidence

'i
don't'
said
gandalf
grimly
it
is
some
time
since
I
last
heard
the
sound
of
your
shears
how
long
have
you
been
eavesdropping'

'eavesdropping
sir
I
don't
follow
you
begging
your
pardon
there
ain't
no
eaves
at
bag
end
and
that's
a
fact'

'don't
be
a
fool
what
have
you
heard
and
why
did
you
listen'
gandalf's
eyes
flashed
and
his
brows
stuck
out
like
bristles

'mr
frodo
sir'
cried
sam
quaking
'don't
let
him
hurt
me
sir
don't
let
him
turn
me
into
anything
unnatural
my
old
dad
would
take
on
so
I
meant
no
harm
on
my
honour
sir'

'he
won't
hurt
you'
said
frodo
hardly
able
to
keep
from
laughing
although
he
was
himself
startled
and
rather
puzzled
'he
knows
as
well
as
I
do
that
you
mean
no
harm
but
just
you
up
and
answer
his
questions
straight
away'

'well
sir'
said
sam
dithering
a
little
'i
heard
a
deal
that
I
didn't
rightly
understand
about
an
enemy
and
rings
and
mr
bilbo
sir
and
dragons
and
a
fiery
mountain
and

and
elves
sir
I
listened
because
I
couldn't
help
myself
if
you
know
what
I
mean
lor
bless
me
sir
but
I
do
love
tales
of
that
sort
and
I
believe
them
too
whatever
ted
may
say
elves
sir
I
would
dearly
love
to
see

them

couldn't
you
take
me
to
see
elves
sir
when
you
go'

suddenly
gandalf
laughed
'come
inside'
he
shouted
and
putting
out
both
his
arms
he
lifted
the
astonished
sam
shears
grassclippings
and
all
right
through
the
window
and
stood
him
on
the
floor
'take
you
to
see
elves
eh'
he
said
eyeing
sam
closely
but
with
a
smile
flickering
on
his
face
'so
you
heard
that
mr
frodo
is
going
away'

'i
did
sir
and
that's
why
I
choked
which
you
heard
seemingly
I
tried
not
to
sir
but
it
burst
out
of
me
I
was
so
upset'


'it
can't
be
helped
sam'
said
frodo
sadly
he
had
suddenly
realized
that
flying
from
the
shire
would
mean
more
painful
partings
than
merely
saying
farewell
to
the
familiar
comforts
of
bag
end
'i
shall
have
to
go
but'

and
here
he
looked
hard
at
sam

'if
you
really
care
about
me
you
will
keep
that

dead

secret
see
if
you
don't
if
you
even
breathe
a
word
of
what
you've
heard
here
then
I
hope
gandalf
will
turn
you
into
a
spotted
toad
and
fill
the
garden
full
of
grasssnakes'

sam
fell
on
his
knees
trembling
'get
up
sam'
said
gandalf
I
have
thought
of
something
better
than
that
something
to
shut
your
mouth
and
punish
you
properly
for
listening
you
shall
go
away
with
mr
frodo'

'me
sir'
cried
sam
springing
up
like
a
dog
invited
for
a
walk
'me
go
and
see
elves
and
all
hooray'
he
shouted
and
then
burst
into
tears


chapter
3


three
is
company


'you
ought
to
go
quietly
and
you
ought
to
go
soon'
said
gandalf
two
or
three
weeks
had
passed
and
still
frodo
made
no
sign
of
getting
ready
to
go

'i
know
but
it
is
difficult
to
do
both'
he
objected
if
I
just
vanish
like
bilbo
the
tale
will
be
all
over
the
shire
in
no
time'

'of
course
you
mustn't
vanish'
said
gandalf
'that
wouldn't
do
at
all
I
said

soon

not

instantly

if
you
can
think
of
any
way
of
slipping
out
of
the
shire
without
its
being
generally
known
it
will
be
worth
a
little
delay
but
you
must
not
delay
too
long'

'what
about
the
autumn
on
or
after
our
birthday'
asked
frodo
'i
think
I
could
probably
make
some
arrangements
by
then'

to
tell
the
truth
he
was
very
reluctant
to
start
now
that
it
had
come
to
the
point
bag
end
seemed
a
more
desirable
residence
than
it
had
for
years
and
he
wanted
to
savour
as
much
as
he
could
of
his
last
summer
in
the
shire
when
autumn
came
he
knew
that
part
at
least
of
his
heart
would
think
more
kindly
of
journeying
as
it
always
did
at
that
season
he
had
indeed
privately
made
up
his
mind
to
leave
on
his
fiftieth
birthday
bilbo's
one
hundred
and
twentyeighth
it
seemed
somehow
the
proper
day
on
which
to
set
out
and
follow
him
following
bilbo
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
the
one
thing
that
made
the
thought
of
leaving
bearable
he
thought
as
little
as
possible
about
the
ring
and
where
it
might
lead
him
in
the
end
but
he
did
not
tell
all
his
thoughts
to
gandalf
what
the
wizard
guessed
was
always
difficult
to
tell

he
looked
at
frodo
and
smiled
'very
well'
he
said
'i
think
that
will
do

but
it
must
not
be
any
later
I
am
getting
very
anxious
in
the
meanwhile
do
take
care
and
don't
let
out
any
hint
of
where
you
are
going
and
see
that
sam
gamgee
does
not
talk
if
he
does
I
really
shall
turn
him
into
a
toad'

'as
for

where
I

am
going'
said
frodo
'it
would
be
difficult
to
give
that
away
for
I
have
no
clear
idea
myself
yet'

'don't
be
absurd'
said
gandalf
'i
am
not
warning
you
against
leaving
an
address
at
the
postoffice
but
you
are
leaving
the
shire

and
that
should
not
be
known
until
you
are
far
away
and
you
must
go
or
at
least
set
out
either
north
south
west
or
east

and
the
direction
should
certainly
not
be
known'

'i
have
been
so
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
leaving
bag
end
and
of
saying
farewell
that
I
have
never
even
considered
the
direction'
said
frodo
'for
where
am
I
to
go
and
by
what
shall
I
steer
what
is
to
be
my
quest
bilbo
went
to
find
a
treasure
there
and
back
again
but
I
go
to
lose
one
and
not
return
as
far
as
I
can
see'

'but
you
cannot
see
very
far'
said
gandalf
'neither
can
I
it
may
be
your
task
to
find
the
cracks
of
doom
but
that
quest
may
be
for
others
I
do
not
know
at
any
rate
you
are
not
ready
for
that
long
road
yet'


'no
indeed'
said
frodo
'but
in
the
meantime
what
course
am
I
to
lake'

'towards
danger
but
not
too
rashly
nor
too
straight'
answered
the
wizard
'if
you
want
my
advice
make
for
rivendell
that
journey
should
not
prove
too
perilous
though
the
road
is
less
easy
than
it
was
and
it
will
grow
worse
as
the
year
fails'

'rivendell'
said
frodo
'very
good
I
will
go
east
and
I
will
make
for
rivendell
I
will
take
sam
to
visit
the
elves
he
will
be
delighted'
he
spoke
lightly
but
his
heart
was
moved
suddenly
with
a
desire
to
see
the
house
of
elrond
halfelven
and
breathe
the
air
of
that
deep
valley
where
many
of
the
fair
folk
still
dwelt
in
peace

one
summer's
evening
an
astonishing
piece
of
news
reached
the

ivy
bush

and

green
dragon

giants
and
other
portents
on
the
borders
of
the
shire
were
forgotten
for
more
important
matters
mr
frodo
was
selling
bag
end
indeed
he
had
already
sold
it

to
the
sackvillebagginses

'for
a
nice
bit
loo'
said
some
'at
a
bargain
price'
said
others
'and
that's
more
likely
when
mistress
lobelia's
the
buyer'
otho
had
died
some
years
before
at
the
ripe
but
disappointed
age
of
102

just
why
mr
frodo
was
selling
his
beautiful
hole
was
even
more
debatable
than
the
price
a
few
held
the
theory

supported
by
the
nods
and
hints
of
mr
baggins
himself

that
frodo's
money
was
running
out
he
was
going
to
leave
hobbiton
and
live
in
a
quiet
way
on
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
down
in
buckland
among
his
brandybuck
relations
'as
far
from
the
sackvillebagginses
as
may
be'
some
added
but
so
firmly
fixed
had
the
notion
of
the
immeasurable
wealth
of
the
bagginses
of
bag
end
become
that
most
found
this
hard
to
believe
harder
than
any
other
reason
or
unreason
that
their
fancy
could
suggest
to
most
it
suggested
a
dark
and
yet
unrevealed
plot
by
gandalf
though
he
kept
himself
very
quiet
and
did
not
go
about
by
day
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
'hiding
up
in
the
bag
end'
but
however
a
removal
might
fit
in
with
the
designs
of
his
wizardry
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
frodo
baggins
was
going
back
to
buckland

'yes
I
shall
be
moving
this
autumn'
he
said
'merry
brandybuck
is
looking
out
for
a
nice
little
hole
for
me
or
perhaps
a
small
house'

as
a
matter
of
fact
with
merry's
help
he
had
already
chosen
and
bought
a
little
house
at
crickhollow
in
the
country
beyond
bucklebury
to
all
but
sam
he
pretended
he
was
going
to
settle
down
there
permanently
the
decision
to
set
out
eastwards
had
suggested
the
idea
to
him
for
buckland
was
on
the
eastern
borders
of
the
shire
and
as
he
had
lived
there
in
childhood
his
going
back
would
at
least
seem
credible

gandalf
stayed
in
the
shire
for
over
two
months
then
one
evening
at
the
end
of
june
soon
after
frodo's
plan
had
been
finally
arranged
he
suddenly
announced
that
he
was
going
off
again
next
morning
'only
for
a
short
while
I
hope'
he
said
'but
I
am
going
down
beyond
the
southern
borders
to
get
some
news
if
I
can
I
have
been
idle
longer
than
I
should'

he
spoke
lightly
but
it
seemed
to
frodo
that
he
looked
rather
worried
'has
anything
happened'
he
asked

'well
no
but
I
have
heard
something
that
has
made
me
anxious
and
needs
looking
into
if
I
think
it
necessary
after
all
for
you
to
get
off
at
once
I
shall
come
back
immediately
or
at
least
send
word
in
the
meanwhile
stick
to
your
plan
but
be
more
careful
than
ever
especially
of
the
ring
let
me
impress
on
you
once
more

don't
use
it'


he
went
off
at
dawn
'i
may
be
back
any
day'
he
said
'at
the
very
latest
I
shall
come
back
for
the
farewell
party
I
think
after
all
you
may
need
my
company
on
the
road'

at
first
frodo
was
a
good
deal
disturbed
and
wondered
often
what
gandalf
could
have
heard
but
his
uneasiness
wore
off
and
in
the
fine
weather
he
forgot
his
troubles
for
a
while
the
shire
had
seldom
seen
so
fair
a
summer
or
so
rich
an
autumn
the
trees
were
laden
with
apples
honey
was
dripping
in
the
combs
and
the
corn
was
tall
and
full

autumn
was
well
under
way
before
frodo
began
to
worry
about
gandalf
again
september
was
passing
and
there
was
still
no
news
of
him
the
birthday
and
the
removal
drew
nearer
and
still
he
did
not
come
or
send
word
bag
end
began
to
be
busy
some
of
frodo's
friends
came
to
stay
and
help
him
with
the
packing
there
was
fredegar
bolger
and
folco
boffin
and
of
course
his
special
friends
pippin
took
and
merry
brandybuck
between
them
they
turned
the
whole
place
upsidedown

on
september
20th
two
covered
carts
went
off
laden
to
buckland
conveying
the
furniture
and
goods
that
frodo
had
not
sold
to
his
new
home
by
way
of
the
brandywine
bridge
the
next
day
frodo
became
really
anxious
and
kept
a
constant
lookout
for
gandalf
thursday
his
birthday
morning
dawned
as
fair
and
clear
as
it
had
long
ago
for
bilbo's
great
party
still
gandalf
did
not
appear
in
the
evening
frodo
gave
his
farewell
feast
it
was
quite
small
just
a
dinner
for
himself
and
his
four
helpers
but
he
was
troubled
and
fell
in
no
mood
for
it
the
thought
that
he
would
so
soon
have
to
part
with
his
young
friends
weighed
on
his
heart
he
wondered
how
he
would
break
it
to
them

the
four
younger
hobbits
were
however
in
high
spirits
and
the
party
soon
became
very
cheerful
in
spite
of
gandalf's
absence
the
diningroom
was
bare
except
for
a
table
and
chairs
but
the
food
was
good
and
there
was
good
wine
frodo's
wine
had
not
been
included
in
the
sale
to
the
sackvillebagginses

'whatever
happens
to
the
rest
of
my
stuff
when
the
sbs
get
their
claws
on
it
at
any
rate
I
have
found
a
good
home
for
this'
said
frodo
as
he
drained
his
glass
it
was
the
last
drop
of
old
winyards

when
they
had
sung
many
songs
and
talked
of
many
things
they
had
done
together
they
toasted
bilbo's
birthday
and
they
drank
his
health
and
frodo's
together
according
to
frodo's
custom
then
they
went
out
for
a
sniff
of
air
and
glimpse
of
the
stars
and
then
they
went
to
bed
frodo's
party
was
over
and
gandalf
had
not
come

the
next
morning
they
were
busy
packing
another
cart
with
the
remainder
of
the
luggage
merry
took
charge
of
this
and
drove
off
with
fatty
that
is
fredegar
bolger
'someone
must
get
there
and
warm
the
house
before
you
arrive'
said
merry
'well
see
you
later

the
day
after
tomorrow
if
you
don't
go
to
sleep
on
the
way'

folco
went
home
after
lunch
but
pippin
remained
behind
frodo
was
restless
and
anxious
listening
in
vain
for
a
sound
of
gandalf
he
decided
to
wait
until
nightfall
after
that
if
gandalf
wanted
him
urgently
he
would
go
to
crickhollow
and
might
even
get
there
first
for
frodo
was
going
on
foot
his
plan

for
pleasure
and
a
last
look
at
the
shire
as
much
as
any
other
reason

was
to
walk
from
hobbiton
to
bucklebury
ferry
taking
it
fairly
easy

'i
shall
get
myself
a
bit
into
training
too'
he
said
looking
at
himself
in
a
dusty
mirror
in
the
halfempty
hall
he
had
not
done
any
strenuous
walking
for
a
long
time
and
the
reflection
looked
rather
flabby
he
thought

after
lunch
the
sackvillebagginses
lobelia
and
her
sandyhaired
son
lotho
turned
up
much
to
frodo's
annoyance
'ours
at
last'
said
lobelia
as
she
stepped
inside
it
was
not
polite
nor
strictly
true
for
the
sale
of
bag
end
did
not
take
effect
until
midnight
but
lobelia
can
perhaps
be
forgiven
she
had
been
obliged
to
wait
about
seventyseven
years
longer
for
bag
end
than
she
once
hoped
and
she
was
now
a
hundred
years
old
anyway
she
had
come
to
see
that
nothing
she
had
paid
for
had
been
carried
off
and
she
wanted
the
keys
it
took
a
long
while
to
satisfy
her
as
she
had
brought
a
complete
inventory
with
her
and
went
right
through
it
in
the
end
she
departed
with
lotho
and
the
spare
key
and
the
promise
that
the
other
key
would
be
left
at
the
gamgees'
in
bagshot
row
she
snorted
and
showed
plainly
that
she
thought
the
gamgees
capable
of
plundering
the
hole
during
the
night
frodo
did
not
offer
her
any
tea

he
took
his
own
tea
with
pippin
and
sam
gamgee
in
the
kitchen
it
had
been
officially
announced
that
sam
was
coming
to
buckland
'to
do
for
mr
frodo
and
look
after
his
bit
of
garden'
an
arrangement
that
was
approved
by
the
gaffer
though
it
did
not
console
him
for
the
prospect
of
having
lobelia
as
a
neighbour


'our
last
meal
at
bag
end'
said
frodo
pushing
back
his
chair
they
left
the
washing
up
for
lobelia
pippin
and
sam
strapped
up
their
three
packs
and
piled
them
in
the
porch
pippin
went
out
for
a
last
stroll
in
the
garden
sam
disappeared

the
sun
went
down
bag
end
seemed
sad
and
gloomy
and
dishevelled
frodo
wandered
round
the
familiar
rooms
and
saw
the
light
of
the
sunset
fade
on
the
walls
and
shadows
creep
out
of
the
corners
it
grew
slowly
dark
indoors
he
went
out
and
walked
down
to
the
gate
at
the
bottom
of
the
path
and
then
on
a
short
way
down
the
hill
road
he
half
expected
to
see
gandalf
come
striding
up
through
the
dusk

the
sky
was
clear
and
the
stars
were
growing
bright
'it's
going
to
be
a
fine
night'
he
said
aloud
'that's
good
for
a
beginning
I
feel
like
walking
I
can't
bear
any
more
hanging
about
I
am
going
to
start
and
gandalf
must
follow
me'
he
turned
to
go
back
and
then
slopped
for
he
heard
voices
just
round
the
corner
by
the
end
of
bagshot
row
one
voice
was
certainly
the
old
gaffer's
the
other
was
strange
and
somehow
unpleasant
he
could
not
make
out
what
it
said
but
he
heard
the
gaffer's
answers
which
were
rather
shrill
the
old
man
seemed
put
out

'no
mr
baggins
has
gone
away
went
this
morning
and
my
sam
went
with
him
anyway
all
his
stuff
went
yes
sold
out
and
gone
I
tell'ee
why
why's
none
of
my
business
or
yours
where
to
that
ain't
no
secret
he's
moved
to
bucklebury
or
some
such
place
away
down
yonder
yes
it
is


a
tidy
way
i've
never
been
so
far
myself
they're
queer
folks
in
buckland
no
I
can't
give
no
message
good
night
to
you'

footsteps
went
away
down
the
hill
frodo
wondered
vaguely
why
the
fact
that
they
did
not
come
on
up
the
hill
seemed
a
great
relief
'i
am
sick
of
questions
and
curiosity
about
my
doings
I
suppose'
he
thought
'what
an
inquisitive
lot
they
all
are'
he
had
half
a
mind
to
go
and
ask
the
gaffer
who
the
inquirer
was
but
he
thought
better
or
worse
of
it
and
turned
and
walked
quickly
back
to
bag
end

pippin
was
sitting
on
his
pack
in
the
porch
sam
was
not
there
frodo
stepped
inside
the
dark
door
'sam'
he
called
'sam
time'

'coming
sir'
came
the
answer
from
far
within
followed
soon
by
sam
himself
wiping
his
mouth
he
had
been
saying
farewell
to
the
beerbarrel
in
the
cellar

'all
aboard
sam'
said
frodo

'yes
sir
i'll
last
for
a
bit
now
sir'

frodo
shut
and
locked
the
round
door
and
gave
the
key
to
sam
'run
down
with
this
to
your
home
sam'
he
said
'then
cut
along
the
row
and
meet
us
as
quick
as
you
can
at
the
gate
in
the
lane
beyond
the
meadows
we
are
not
going
through
the
village
tonight
too
many
ears
pricking
and
eyes
prying'
sam
ran
off
at
full
speed

'well
now
we're
off
at
last'
said
frodo
they
shouldered
their
packs
and
took
up
their
sticks
and
walked
round
the
corner
to
the
west
side
of
bag
end
'goodbye'
said
frodo
looking
at
the
dark
blank
windows
he
waved
his
hand
and
then
turned
and
following
bilbo
if
he
had
known
it
hurried
after
peregrin
down
the
gardenpath
they
jumped
over
the
low
place
in
the
hedge
at
the
bottom
and
took
to
the
fields
passing
into
the
darkness
like
a
rustle
in
the
grasses

at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
on
its
western
side
they
came
to
the
gate
opening
on
to
a
narrow
lane
there
they
halted
and
adjusted
the
straps
of
their
packs
presently
sam
appeared
trotting
quickly
and
breathing
hard
his
heavy
pack
was
hoisted
high
on
his
shoulders
and
he
had
put
on
his
head
a
tall
shapeless
fell
bag
which
he
called
a
hat
in
the
gloom
he
looked
very
much
like
a
dwarf

'i
am
sure
you
have
given
me
all
the
heaviest
stuff'
said
frodo
'i
pity
snails
and
all
that
carry
their
homes
on
their
backs'

'i
could
take
a
lot
more
yet
sir
my
packet
is
quite
light'
said
sam
stoutly
and
untruthfully

'no
you
don't
sam'
said
pippin
'it
is
good
for
him
he's
got
nothing
except
what
he
ordered
us

to
pack
he's
been
slack
lately
and
he'll
feel
the
weight
less
when
he's
walked
off
some
of
his
own'
'be
kind
to
a
poor
old
hobbit'
laughed
frodo
'i
shall
be
as
thin
as
a
willowwand
i'm
sure
before
I
get
to
buckland
but
I
was
talking
nonsense
I
suspect
you
have
taken
more
than
your

share
sam
and
I
shall
look
into
it
at
our
next
packing'
he
picked
up
his
stick
again
'well
we
all
like
walking
in
the
dark'
he
said
'so
let's
put
some
miles
behind
us
before
bed'

for
a
short
way
they
followed
the
lane
westwards
then
leaving
it
they
turned
left
and
took
quietly
to
the
fields
again
they
went
in
single
file
along
hedgerows
and
the
borders
of
coppices
and
night
fell
dark
about
them
in
their
dark
cloaks
they
were
as
invisible
as
if
they
all
had
magic
rings
since
they
were
all
hobbits
and
were
trying
to
be
silent
they
made
no
noise
that
even
hobbits
would
hear
even
the
wild
things
in
the
fields
and
woods
hardly
noticed
their
passing

after
some
time
they
crossed
the
water
west
of
hobbiton
by
a
narrow
plankbridge
the
stream
was
there
no
more
than
a
winding
black
ribbon
bordered
with
leaning
aldertrees
a
mile
or
two
further
south
they
hastily
crossed
the
great
road
from
the
brandywine
bridge
they
were
now
in
the
tookland
and
bending
southeastwards
they
made
for
the
green
hill
country
as
they
began
to
climb
its
first
slopes
they
looked
back
and
saw
the
lamps
in
hobbiton
far
off
twinkling
in
the
gentle
valley
of
the
water
soon
it
disappeared
in
the
folds
of
the
darkened
land
and
was
followed
by
bywater
beside
its
grey
pool
when
the
light
of
the
last
farm
was
far
behind
peeping
among
the
trees
frodo
turned
and
waved
a
hand
in
farewell

'i
wonder
if
I
shall
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again'
he
said
quietly

when
they
had
walked
for
about
three
hours
they
rested
the
night
was
clear
cool
and
starry
but
smokelike
wisps
of
mist
were
creeping
up
the
hillsides
from
the
streams
and
deep
meadows
thinclad
birches
swaying
in
a
light
wind
above
their
heads
made
a
black
net
against
the
pale
sky
they
ate
a
very
frugal
supper
for
hobbits
and
then
went
on
again
soon
they
struck
a
narrow
road
that
went
rolling
up
and
down
fading
grey
into
the
darkness
ahead
the
road
to
woodhall
and
stock
and
the
bucklebury
ferry
it
climbed
away
from
the
main
road
in
the
watervalley
and
wound
over
the
skirts
of
the
green
hills
towards
woodyend
a
wild
corner
of
the
eastfarthing

after
a
while
they
plunged
into
a
deeply
cloven
track
between
tall
trees
that
rustled
their
dry
leaves
in
the
night
it
was
very
dark
at
first
they
talked
or
hummed
a
tune
softly
together
being
now
far
away
from
inquisitive
ears
then
they
marched
on
in
silence
and
pippin
began
to
lag
behind
at
last
as
they
began
to
climb
a
steep
slope
he
stopped
and
yawned

'i
am
so
sleepy'
he
said
'that
soon
I
shall
fall
down
on
the
road
are
you
going
to
sleep
on
your
legs
it
is
nearly
midnight'

'i
thought
you
liked
walking
in
the
dark'
said
frodo
'but
there
is
no
great
hurry
merry
expects
us
some
time
the
day
after
tomorrow
but
that
leaves
us
nearly
two
days
more
we'll
halt
at
the
first
likely
spot'

'the
wind's
in
the
west'
said
sam
'if
we
get
to
the
other
side
of
this
hill
we
shall
find
a
spot
that
is
sheltered
and
snug
enough
sir
there
is
a
dry
firwood
just
ahead
if
I
remember
rightly'
sam
knew
the
land
well
within
twenty
miles
of
hobbiton
but
that
was
the
limit
of
his
geography

just
over
the
top
of
the
hill
they
came
on
the
patch
of
firwood
leaving
the
road
they
went
into
the
deep
resinscented
darkness
of
the
trees
and
gathered
dead
sticks
and
cones
to
make
a
fire
soon
they
had
a
merry
crackle
of
flame
at
the
foot
of
a
large
firtree
and
they
sat
round
it
for
a
while
until
they
began
to
nod
then
each
in
an
angle
of
the
great
tree's
roots
they
curled
up
in
their
cloaks
and
blankets
and
were
soon
fast
asleep
they
set
no
watch
even
frodo
feared
no
danger
yet
for
they
were
still
in
the
heart
of
the
shire
a
few
creatures
came
and
looked
at
them
when
the
fire
had
died
away
a
fox
passing
through
the
wood
on
business
of
his
own
stopped
several
minutes
and
sniffed

'hobbits'
he
thought
'well
what
next
I
have
heard
of
strange
doings
in
this
land
but
I
have
seldom
heard
of
a
hobbit
sleeping
out
of
doors
under
a
tree
three
of
them
there's
something
mighty
queer
behind
this'
he
was
quite
right
but
he
never
found
out
any
more
about
it

the
morning
came
pale
and
clammy
frodo
woke
up
first
and
found
that
a
treeroot
had
made
a
hole
in
his
back
and
that
his
neck
was
stiff


'walking
for
pleasure
why
didn't
I
drive'
he
thought
as
he
usually
did
at
the
beginning
of
an
expedition
'and
all
my
beautiful
feather
beds
are
sold
to
the
sackvillebagginses
these
treeroots
would
do
them
good'
he
stretched
'wake
up
hobbits'
he
cried
it's
a
beautiful
morning'

'what's
beautiful
about
it'
said
pippin
peering
over
the
edge
of
his
blanket
with
one
eye
'sam
gel
breakfast
ready
for
halfpast
nine
have
you
got
the
bathwater
hot'

sam
jumped
up
looking
rather
bleary
'no
sir
I
haven't
sir'
he
said

frodo
stripped
the
blankets
from
pippin
and
rolled
him
over
and
then
walked
off
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
away
eastward
the
sun
was
rising
red
out
of
the
mists
that
lay
thick
on
the
world
touched
with
gold
and
red
the
autumn
trees
seemed
to
be
sailing
rootless
in
a
shadowy
sea
a
little
below
him
to
the
left
the
road
ran
down
steeply
into
a
hollow
and
disappeared

when
he
returned
sam
and
pippin
had
got
a
good
fire
going
'water'
shouted
pippin
'where's
the
water'

'i
don't
keep
water
in
my
pockets'
said
frodo
'we
thought
you
had
gone
to
find
some'
said
pippin
busy
setting
out
the
food
and
cups
'you
had
better
go
now'

'you
can
come
too'
said
frodo
'and
bring
all
the
waterbottles'
there
was
a
stream
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
filled
their
bottles
and
the
small
camping
kettle
at
a
little
fall
where
the
water
fell
a
few
feet
over
an
outcrop
of
grey
stone
it
was
icy
cold
and
they
spluttered
and
puffed
as
they
bathed
their
faces
and
hands

when
their
breakfast
was
over
and
their
packs
all
trussed
up
again
it
was
after
ten
o'clock
and
the
day
was
beginning
to
turn
fine
and
hot
they
went
down
the
slope
and
across
the
stream
where
it
dived
under
the
road
and
up
the
next
slope
and
up
and
down
another
shoulder
of
the
hills
and
by
that
time
their
cloaks
blankets
water
food
and
other
gear
already
seemed
a
heavy
burden

the
day's
march
promised
to
be
warm
and
tiring
work
after
some
miles
however
the
road
ceased
to
roll
up
and
down
it
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
steep
bank
in
a
weary
zigzagging
sort
of
way
and
then
prepared
to
go
down
for
the
last
time
in
front
of
them
they
saw
the
lower
lands
dotted
with
small
clumps
of
trees
that
melted
away
in
the
distance
to
a
brown
woodland
haze
they
were
looking
across
the
woody
end
towards
the
brandywine
river
the
road
wound
away
before
them
like
a
piece
of
string

'the
road
goes
on
for
ever'
said
pippin
'but
I
can't
without
a
rest
it
is
high
time
for
lunch'
he
sat
down
on
the
bank
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
looked
away
east
into
the
haze
beyond
which
lay
the
river
and
the
end
of
the
shire
in
which
he
had
spent
all
his
life
sam
stood
by
him
his
round
eyes
were
wide
open

for
he
was
looking
across
lands
he
had
never
seen
to
a
new
horizon

'do
elves
live
in
those
woods'
he
asked

'not
that
I
ever
heard'
said
pippin
frodo
was
silent
he
too
was
gazing
eastward
along
the
road
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
suddenly
he
spoke
aloud
but
as
if
to
himself
saying
slowly

the
road
goes
ever
on
and
on

down
from
the
door
where
it
began

now
far
ahead
the
road
has
gone

and
I
must
follow
if
I
can

pursuing
it
with
weary
feet

until
it
joins
some
larger
way

where
many
paths
and
errands
meet

and
whither
then
I
cannot
say


'that
sounds
like
a
bit
of
old
bilbo's
rhyming'
said
pippin
'or
is
it
one
of
your
imitations
it
does
not
sound
altogether
encouraging'

'i
don't
know'
said
frodo
it
came
to
me
then
as
if
I
was
making
it
up
but
I
may
have
heard
it
long
ago
certainly
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
bilbo
in
the
last
years
before
he
went
away
he
used
often
to
say
there
was
only
one
road
that
it
was
like
a
great
river
its
springs
were
at
every
doorstep
and
every
path
was
its
tributary
it's
a
dangerous
business
frodo
going
out
of
your
door
he
used
to
say
you
step
into
the
road
and
if
you
don't
keep
your
feet
there
is
no
knowing
where
you
might
be
swept
off
to
do
you
realize
that
this
is
the
very
path
that
goes
through
mirkwood
and
that
if
you
let
it
it
might
take
you
to
the
lonely
mountain
or
even
further
and
to
worse
places
he
used
to
say
that
on
the
path
outside
the
front
door
at
bag
end
especially
after
he
had
been
out
for
a
long
walk'

'well
the
road
won't
sweep
me
anywhere
for
an
hour
at
least'
said
pippin
unslinging
his
pack
the
others
followed
his
example
putting
their
packs
against
the
bank
and
their
legs
out
into
the
road
after
a
rest
they
had
a
good
lunch
and
then
more
rest

the
sun
was
beginning
to
get
low
and
the
light
of
afternoon
was
on
the
land
as
they
went
down
the
hill
so
far
they
had
not
met
a
soul
on
the
road
this
way
was
not
much
used
being
hardly
fit
for
carts
and
there
was
little
traffic
to
the
woody
end
they
had
been
jogging
along
again
for
an
hour
or
more
when
sam
stopped
a
moment
as
if
listening
they
were
now
on
level
ground
and
the
road
after
much
winding
lay
straight
ahead
through
grassland
sprinkled
with
tall
trees
outliers
of
the
approaching
woods

'i
can
hear
a
pony
or
a
horse
coming
along
the
road
behind'
said
sam

they
looked
back
but
the
turn
of
the
road
prevented
them
from
seeing
far
'i
wonder
if
that
is
gandalf
coming
after
us'
said
frodo
but
even
as
he
said
it
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
not
so
and
a
sudden
desire
to
hide
from
the
view
of
the
rider
came
over
him

'it
may
not
matter
much'
he
said
apologetically
'but
I
would
rather
not
be
seen
on
the
road

by
anyone
I
am
sick
of
my
doings
being
noticed
and
discussed
and
if
it
is
gandalf'
he
added
as
an
afterthought
'we
can
give
him
a
little
surprise
to
pay
him
out
for
being
so
late
let's
get
out
of
sight'

the
other
two
ran
quickly
to
the
left
and
down
into
a
little
hollow
not
far
from
the
road
there
they
lay
flat
frodo
hesitated
for
a
second
curiosity
or
some
other
feeling
was
struggling
with
his
desire
to
hide
the
sound
of
hoofs
drew
nearer
just
in
time
he
threw
himself
down
in
a
patch
of
long
grass
behind
a
tree
that
overshadowed
the
road
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
peered
cautiously
above
one
of
the
great
roots

round
the
corner
came
a
black
horse
no
hobbitpony
but
a
fullsized
horse
and
on
it
sat
a
large
man
who
seemed
to
crouch
in
the
saddle
wrapped
in
a
great
black
cloak
and
hood
so
that
only
his
boots
in
the
high
stirrups
showed
below
his
face
was
shadowed
and
invisible

when
it
reached
the
tree
and
was
level
with
frodo
the
horse
stopped
the
riding
figure
sat
quite
still
with
its
head
bowed
as
if
listening
from
inside
the
hood
came
a
noise
as
of
someone
sniffing
to
catch
an
elusive
scent
the
head
turned
from
side
to
side
of
the
road

a
sudden
unreasoning
fear
of
discovery
laid
hold
of
frodo
and
he
thought
of
his
ring
he
hardly
dared
to
breathe
and
yet
the
desire
to
get
it
out
of
his
pocket
became
so
strong
that
he
began
slowly
to
move
his
hand
he
felt
that
he
had
only
to
slip
it
on
and
then
he
would
be
safe
the
advice
of
gandalf
seemed
absurd
bilbo
had
used
the
ring
'and
I
am
still
in
the
shire'
he
thought
as
his
hand
touched
the
chain
on
which
it
hung
at
that
moment
the
rider
sat
up
and
shook
the
reins
the
horse
stepped
forward
walking
slowly
at
first
and
then
breaking
into
a
quick
trot

frodo
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
road
and
watched
the
rider
until
he
dwindled
into
the
distance
he
could
not
be
quite
sure
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
suddenly
before
it
passed
out
of
sight
the
horse
turned
aside
and
went
into
the
trees
on
the
right

'well
I
call
that
very
queer
and
indeed
disturbing'
said
frodo
to
himself
as
he
walked
towards
his
companions
pippin
and
sam
had
remained
flat
in
the
grass
and
had
seen
nothing
so
frodo
described
the
rider
and
his
strange
behaviour

'i
can't
say
why
but
I
felt
certain
he
was
looking
or

smelling

for
me
and
also
I
felt
certain
that
I
did
not
want
him
to
discover
me
i've
never
seen
or
fell
anything
like
it
in
the
shire
before'

'but
what
has
one
of
the
big
people
got
to
do
with
us'
said
pippin
'and
what
is
he
doing
in
this
part
of
the
world'


'there
are
some
men
about'
said
frodo
'down
in
the
southfarthing
they
have
had
trouble
with
big
people
I
believe
but
I
have
never
heard
of
anything
like
this
rider
I
wonder
where
he
comes
from'

'begging
your
pardon'
put
in
sam
suddenly
'i
know
where
he
comes
from
it's
from
hobbiton
that
this
here
black
rider
comes
unless
there's
more
than
one
and
I
know
where
he's
going
to'

'what
do
you
mean'
said
frodo
sharply
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
'why
didn't
you
speak
up
before'

'i
have
only
just
remembered
sir
it
was
like
this
when
I
got
back
to
our
hole
yesterday
evening
with
the
key
my
dad
he
says
to
me

hello
sam

he
says

I
thought
you
were
away
with
mr
frodo
this
morning
there's
been
a
strange
customer
asking
for
mr
baggins
of
bag
end
and
he's
only
just
gone
i've
sent
him
on
to
bucklebury
not
that
I
liked
the
sound
of
him
he
seemed
mighty
put
out
when
I
told
him
mr
baggins
had
left
his
old
home
for
good
hissed
at
me
he
did
it
gave
me
quite
a
shudder
what
sort
of
a
fellow
was
he

says
I
to
the
gaffer

I
don't
know

says
he

but
he
wasn't
a
hobbit
he
was
tall
and
blacklike
and
he
stooped
aver
me
I
reckon
it
was
one
of
the
big
folk
from
foreign
parts
he
spoke
funny


'i
couldn't
stay
to
hear
more
sir
since
you
were
waiting
and
I
didn't
give
much
heed
to
it
myself
the
gaffer
is
getting
old
and
more
than
a
bit
blind
and
it
must
have
been
near
dark
when
this
fellow
come
up
the
hill
and
found
him
taking
the
air
at
the
end
of
our
row
I
hope
he
hasn't
done
no
harm
sir
nor
me'

'the
gaffer
can't
be
blamed
anyway'
said
frodo
'as
a
matter
of
fact
I
heard
him
talking
to
a
stranger
who
seemed
to
be
inquiring
for
me
and
I
nearly
went
and
asked
him
who
it
was
I
wish
I
had
or
you
had
told
me
about
it
before
I
might
have
been
more
careful
on
the
road'

'still
there
may
be
no
connexion
between
this
rider
and
the
gaffer's
stranger'
said
pippin
'we
left
hobbiton
secretly
enough
and
I
don't
see
how
he
could
have
followed
us'

'what
about
the

smelling

sir'
said
sam
'and
the
gaffer
said
he
was
a
black
chap'

'i
wish
I
had
waited
for
gandalf'
frodo
muttered
'but
perhaps
it
would
only
have
made
matters
worse'

'then
you
know
or
guess
something
about
this
rider'
said
pippin
who
had
caught
the
muttered
words

'i
don't
know
and
I
would
rather
not
guess'
said
frodo
'all
right
cousin
frodo
you
can
keep
your
secret
for
the
present
if
you
want
to
be
mysterious
in
the
meanwhile
what
are
we
to
do
I
should
like
a
bite
and
a
sup
but
somehow
I
think
we
had
better
move
on
from
here
your
talk
of
sniffing
riders
with
invisible
noses
has
unsettled
me'

'yes
I
think
we
will
move
on
now'
said
frodo
'but
not
on
the
road
in
case
that
rider
comes
back
or
another
follows
him
we
ought
to
do
a
good
step
more
today
buckland
is
still
miles
away'

the
shadows
of
the
trees
were
long
and
thin
on
the
grass
as
they
started
off
again
they
now
kept
a
stone's
throw
to
the
left
of
the
road
and
kept
out
of
sight
of
it
as
much
as
they
could
but
this
hindered
them
for
the
grass
was
thick
and
tussocky
and
the
ground
uneven
and
the
trees
began
to
draw
together
into
thickets

the
sun
had
gone
down
red
behind
the
hills
at
their
backs
and
evening
was
coming
on
before
they
came
back
to
the
road
at
the
end
of
the
long
level
over
which
it
had
run
straight
for
some
miles
at
that
point
it
bent
left
and
went
down
into
the
lowlands
of
the
yale
making
for
stock
but
a
lane
branched
right
winding
through
a
wood
of
ancient
oaktrees
on
its
way
to
woodhall
'that
is
the
way
for
us'
said
frodo

not
far
from
the
roadmeeting
they
came
on
the
huge
hulk
of
a
tree
it
was
still
alive
and
had
leaves
on
the
small
branches
that
it
had
put
out
round
the
broken
stumps
of
its
longfallen
limbs
but
it
was
hollow
and
could
be
entered
by
a
great
crack
on
the
side
away
from
the
road
the
hobbits
crept
inside
and
sat
there
upon
a
floor
of
old
leaves
and
decayed
wood
they
rested
and
had
a
light
meal
talking
quietly
and
listening
from
time
to
time


twilight
was
about
them
as
they
crept
back
to
the
lane
the
west
wind
was
sighing
in
the
branches
leaves
were
whispering
soon
the
road
began
to
fall
gently
but
steadily
into
the
dusk
a
star
came
out
above
the
trees
in
the
darkening
east
before
them
they
went
abreast
and
in
step
to
keep
up
their
spirits
after
a
time
as
the
stars
grew
thicker
and
brighter
the
feeling
of
disquiet
left
them
and
they
no
longer
listened
for
the
sound
of
hoofs
they
began
to
hum
softly
as
hobbits
have
a
way
of
doing
as
they
walk
along
especially
when
they
are
drawing
near
to
home
at
night
with
most
hobbits
it
is
a
suppersong
or
a
bedsong
but
these
hobbits
hummed
a
walkingsong
though
not
of
course
without
any
mention
of
supper
and
bed
bilbo
baggins
had
made
the
words
to
a
tune
that
was
as
old
as
the
hills
and
taught
it
to
frodo
as
they
walked
in
the
lanes
of
the
watervalley
and
talked
about
adventure

upon
the
hearth
the
fire
is
red

beneath
the
roof
there
is
a
bed

but
not
yet
weary
are
our
feet

still
round
the
corner
we
may
meet

a
sudden
tree
or
standing
stone

that
none
have
seen
but
we
alone

tree
and
flower
and
leaf
and
grass


let
them
pass
let
them
pass

hill
and
water
under
sky

pass
them
by
pass
them
by


still
round
the
corner
there
may
wait

a
new
road
or
a
secret
gate

and
though
we
pass
them
by
today

tomorrow
we
may
come
this
way

and
take
the
hidden
paths
that
run

towards
the
moon
or
to
the
sun


apple
thorn
and
nut
and
sloe

let
them
go
let
them
go

sand
and
stone
and
pool
and
dell

fare
you
well
fare
you
well


home
is
behind
the
world
ahead

and
there
are
many
paths
to
tread

through
shadows
to
the
edge
of
night

until
the
stars
are
all
alight

then
world
behind
and
home
ahead

we'll
wander
back
to
home
and
bed


mist
and
twilight
cloud
and
shade

away
shall
fade
away
shall
fade

fire
and
lamp
and
meat
and
bread

and
then
to
bed
and
then
to
bed


the
song
ended
'and

now

to
bed
and

now

to
bed'
sang
pippin
in
a
high
voice

'hush'
said
frodo
'i
think
I
hear
hoofs
again'

they
slopped
suddenly
and
stood
as
silent
as
treeshadows
listening
there
was
a
sound
of


hoofs
in
the
lane
some
way
behind
but
coming
slow
and
clear
down
the
wind
quickly
and
quietly
they
slipped
off
the
path
and
ran
into
the
deeper
shade
under
the
oaktrees


'don't
let
us
go
too
far'
said
frodo
'i
don't
want
to
be
seen
but
I
want
to
see
if
it
is
another
black
rider'

'very
well'
said
pippin
'but
don't
forget
the
sniffing'

the
hoofs
drew
nearer
they
had
no
time
to
find
any
hidingplace
better
than
the
general
darkness
under
the
trees
sam
and
pippin
crouched
behind
a
large
treebole
while
frodo
crept
back
a
few
yards
towards
the
lane
it
showed
grey
and
pale
a
line
of
fading
light
through
the
wood
above
it
the
stars
were
thick
in
the
dim
sky
but
there
was
no
moon

the
sound
of
hoofs
stopped
as
frodo
watched
he
saw
something
dark
pass
across
the
lighter
space
between
two
trees
and
then
halt
it
looked
like
the
black
shade
of
a
horse
led
by
a
smaller
black
shadow
the
black
shadow
stood
close
to
the
point
where
they
had
left
the
path
and
it
swayed
from
side
to
side
frodo
thought
he
heard
the
sound
of
snuffling
the
shadow
bent
to
the
ground
and
then
began
to
crawl
towards
him

once
more
the
desire
to
slip
on
the
ring
came
over
frodo
but
this
time
it
was
stronger
than
before
so
strong
that
almost
before
he
realized
what
he
was
doing
his
hand
was
groping
in
his
pocket
but
at
that
moment
there
came
a
sound
like
mingled
song
and
laughter
clear
voices
rose
and
fell
in
the
starlit
air
the
black
shadow
straightened
up
and
retreated
it
climbed
on
to
the
shadowy
horse
and
seemed
to
vanish
across
the
lane
into
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
frodo
breathed
again

'elves'
exclaimed
sam
in
a
hoarse
whisper
'elves
sir'
he
would
have
burst
out
of
the
trees
and
dashed
off
towards
the
voices
if
they
had
not
pulled
him
back

'yes
it
is
elves'
said
frodo
'one
can
meet
them
sometimes
in
the
woody
end
they
don't
live
in
the
shire
but
they
wander
into
it
in
spring
and
autumn
out
of
their
own
lands
away
beyond
the
tower
hills
I
am
thankful
that
they
do
you
did
not
see
but
that
black
rider
stopped
just
here
and
was
actually
crawling
towards
us
when
the
song
began
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
voices
he
slipped
away'

'what
about
the
elves'
said
sam
too
excited
to
trouble
about
the
rider
'can't
we
go
and
see
them'

'listen
they
are
coming
this
way'
said
frodo
'we
have
only
to
wait'
the
singing
drew
nearer
one
clear
voice
rose
now
above
the
others
it
was
singing
in
the
fair
elventongue
of
which
frodo
knew
only
a
little
and
the
others
knew
nothing
yet
the
sound
blending
with
the
melody
seemed
to
shape
itself
in
their
thought
into
words
which
they
only
partly
understood
this
was
the
song
as
frodo
heard
it

snowwhite
snowwhite
o
lady
clear

o
queen
beyond
the
western
seas

o
light
to
us
that
wander
here

amid
the
world
of
woven
trees


gilthoniel
o
elbereth

clear
are
thy
eyes
and
bright
thy
breath

snowwhite
snowwhite
we
sing
to
thee

in
a
far
land
beyond
the
sea


o
stars
that
in
the
sunless
year

with
shining
hand
by
her
were
sawn

in
windy
fields
now
bright
and
clear

we
see
your
silver
blossom
blown


o
elbereth
gilthoniel

we
still
remember
we
who
dwell



in
this
far
land
beneath
the
trees

thy
starlight
on
the
western
seas

the
song
ended
'these
are
high
elves
they
spoke
the
name
of
elbereth'
said
frodo
in
amazement
'few
of
that
fairest
folk
are
ever
seen
in
the
shire
not
many
now
remain
in
middleearth
east
of
the
great
sea
this
is
indeed
a
strange
chance'

the
hobbits
sat
in
shadow
by
the
wayside
before
long
the
elves
came
down
the
lane
towards
the
valley
they
passed
slowly
and
the
hobbits
could
see
the
starlight
glimmering
on
their
hair
and
in
their
eyes
they
bore
no
lights
yet
as
they
walked
a
shimmer
like
the
light
of
the
moon
above
the
rim
of
the
hills
before
it
rises
seemed
to
fall
about
their
feet
they
were
now
silent
and
as
the
last
elf
passed
he
turned
and
looked
towards
the
hobbits
and
laughed

'hail
frodo'
he
cried
'you
are
abroad
late
or
are
you
perhaps
lost'
then
he
called
aloud
to
the
others
and
all
the
company
stopped
and
gathered
round

'this
is
indeed
wonderful'
they
said
'three
hobbits
in
a
wood
at
night
we
have
not
seen
such
a
thing
since
bilbo
went
away
what
is
the
meaning
of
it'

'the
meaning
of
it
fair
people'
said
frodo
'is
simply
that
we
seem
to
be
going
the
same
way
as
you
are
I
like
walking
under
the
stars
but
I
would
welcome
your
company'

'but
we
have
no
need
of
other
company
and
hobbits
are
so
dull'
they
laughed
'and
how
do
you
know
that
we
go
the
same
way
as
you
for
you
do
not
know
whither
we
are
going'

'and
how
do
you
know
my
name'
asked
frodo
in
return

'we
know
many
things'
they
said
'we
have
seen
you
often
before
with
bilbo
though
you
may
not
have
seen
us'

'who
are
you
and
who
is
your
lord'
asked
frodo

'i
am
gildor'
answered
their
leader
the
elf
who
had
first
hailed
him
'gildor
inglorion
of
the
house
of
finrod
we
are
exiles
and
most
of
our
kindred
have
long
ago
departed
and
we
too
are
now
only
tarrying
here
a
while
ere
we
return
over
the
great
sea
but
some
of
our
kinsfolk
dwell
still
in
peace
in
rivendell
come
now
frodo
tell
us
what
you
are
doing
for
we
see
that
there
is
some
shadow
of
fear
upon
you'

'o
wise
people'
interrupted
pippin
eagerly
'tell
us
about
the
black
riders'

'black
riders'
they
said
in
low
voices
'why
do
you
ask
about
black
riders'

'because
two
black
riders
have
overtaken
us
today
or
one
has
done
so
twice'
said
pippin
'only
a
little
while
ago
he
slipped
away
as
you
drew
near'

the
elves
did
not
answer
at
once
but
spoke
together
softly
in
their
own
tongue
at
length
gildor
turned
to
the
hobbits
'we
will
not
speak
of
this
here'
he
said
'we
think
you
had
best
come
now
with
us
it
is
not
our
custom
but
for
this
time
we
will
lake
you
on
our
road
and
you
shall
lodge
with
us
tonight
if
you
will'

'o
fair
folk
this
is
good
fortune
beyond
my
hope'
said
pippin
sam
was
speechless
'i
thank
you
indeed
gildor
inglorion'
said
frodo
bowing

'elen
sla
lmenn'
omentielvo

a
star
shines
on
the
hour
of
our
meeting'
he
added
in
the
highelven
speech

'be
careful
friends'
cried
gildor
laughing
'speak
no
secrets
here
is
a
scholar
in
the
ancient
tongue
bilbo
was
a
good
master
hail
elffriend'
he
said
bowing
to
frodo
'come
now
with
your
friends
and
join
our
company
you
had
best
walk
in
the
middle
so
that
you
may
not
stray
you
may
be
weary
before
we
halt'

'why
where
are
you
going'
asked
frodo

'for
tonight
we
go
to
the
woods
on
the
hills
above
woodhall
it
is
some
miles
but
you
shall
have
rest
at
the
end
of
it
and
it
will
shorten
your
journey
tomorrow'

they
now
marched
on
again
in
silence
and
passed
like
shadows
and
faint
lights
for
elves
even
more
than
hobbits
could
walk
when
they
wished
without
sound
or
footfall
pippin
soon
began
to
feel
sleepy
and
staggered
once
or
twice
but
each
time
a
tall
elf
at
his
side
put
out
his
arm
and
saved
him
from
a
fall
sam
walked
along
at
frodo's
side
as
if
in
a
dream
with
an
expression
on
his
face
half
of
fear
and
half
of
astonished
joy

the
woods
on
either
side
became
denser
the
trees
were
now
younger
and
thicker
and
as
the
lane
went
lower
running
down
into
a
fold
of
the
hills
there
were
many
deep
brakes
of
hazel
on
the
rising
slopes
at
either
hand
at
last
the
elves
turned
aside
from
the
path
a
green
ride
lay
almost
unseen
through
the
thickets
on
the
right
and
this
they
followed
as
it
wound
away
back
up
the
wooded
slopes
on
to
the
top
of
a
shoulder
of
the
hills
that
stood
out
into
the
lower
land
of
the
rivervalley
suddenly
they
came
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
before
them
lay
a
wide
space
of
grass
grey
under
the
night
on
three
sides
the
woods
pressed
upon
it
but
eastward
the
ground
fell
steeply
and
the
tops
of
the
dark
trees
growing
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
were
below
their
feet
beyond
the
low
lands
lay
dim
and
flat
under
the
stars
nearer
at
hand
a
few
lights
twinkled
in
the
village
of
woodhall

the
elves
sat
on
the
grass
and
spoke
together
in
soft
voices
they
seemed
to
take
no
further
notice
of
the
hobbits
frodo
and
his
companions
wrapped
themselves
in
cloaks
and
blankets
and
drowsiness
stole
over
them
the
night
grew
on
and
the
lights
in
the
valley
went
out
pippin
fell
asleep
pillowed
on
a
green
hillock

away
high
in
the
east
swung
remmirath
the
netted
stars
and
slowly
above
the
mists
red
borgil
rose
glowing
like
a
jewel
of
fire
then
by
some
shift
of
airs
all
the
mist
was
drawn
away
like
a
veil
and
there
leaned
up
as
he
climbed
over
the
rim
of
the
world
the
swordsman
of
the
sky
menelvagor
with
his
shining
belt
the
elves
all
burst
into
song
suddenly
under
the
trees
a
fire
sprang
up
with
a
red
light

'come'
the
elves
called
to
the
hobbits
'come
now
is
the
time
for
speech
and
merriment'

pippin
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
shivered
'there
is
a
fire
in
the
hall
and
food
for
hungry
guests'
said
an
elf
standing
before
him

at
the
south
end
of
the
greensward
there
was
an
opening
there
the
green
floor
ran
on
into
the
wood
and
formed
a
wide
space
like
a
hall
roofed
by
the
boughs
of
trees
their
great
trunks
ran
like
pillars
down
each
side
in
the
middle
there
was
a
woodfire
blazing
and
upon
the
treepillars
torches
with
lights
of
gold
and
silver
were
burning
steadily
the
elves
sat
round
the
fire
upon
the
grass
or
upon
the
sawn
rings
of
old
trunks
some
went
to
and
fro
bearing
cups
and
pouring
drink
others
brought
food
on
heaped
plates
and
dishes

'this
is
poor
fare'
they
said
to
the
hobbits
'for
we
are
lodging
in
the
greenwood
far
from
our
halls
if
ever
you
are
our
guests
at
home
we
will
treat
you
better'

'it
seems
to
me
good
enough
for
a
birthdayparty'
said
frodo

pippin
afterwards
recalled
little
of
either
food
or
drink
for
his
mind
was
filled
with
the
light
upon
the
elffaces
and
the
sound
of
voices
so
various
and
so
beautiful
that
he
felt
in
a
waking
dream
but
he
remembered
that
there
was
bread
surpassing
the
savour
of
a
fair
white
loaf
to
one
who
is
starving
and
fruits
sweet
as
wildberries
and
richer
than
the
tended
fruits
of
gardens
he
drained
a
cup
that
was
filled
with
a
fragrant
draught
cool
as
a
clear
fountain
golden
as
a
summer
afternoon

sam
could
never
describe
in
words
nor
picture
clearly
to
himself
what
he
felt
or
thought
that
night
though
it
remained
in
his
memory
as
one
of
the
chief
events
of
his
life
the
nearest
he
ever
got
was
to
say
'well
sir
if
I
could
grow
apples
like
that
I
would
call
myself
a
gardener
but
it
was
the
singing
that
went
to
my
heart
if
you
know
what
I
mean'

frodo
sat
eating
drinking
and
talking
with
delight
but
his
mind
was
chiefly
on
the
words
spoken
he
knew
a
little
of
the
elfspeech
and
listened
eagerly
now
and
again
he
spoke
to
those
that
served
him
and
thanked
them
in
their
own
language
they
smiled
at
him
and
said
laughing
'here
is
a
jewel
among
hobbits'

after
a
while
pippin
fell
fast
asleep
and
was
lifted
up
and
borne
away
to
a
bower
under
the
trees
there
he
was
laid
upon
a
soft
bed
and
slept
the
rest
of
the
night
away
sam
refused
to
leave
his
master
when
pippin
had
gone
he
came
and
sat
curled
up
at
frodo's
feet
where
at
last
he
nodded
and
closed
his
eyes
frodo
remained
long
awake
talking
with
gildor

they
spoke
of
many
things
old
and
new
and
frodo
questioned
gildor
much
about
happenings
in
the
wide
world
outside
the
shire
the
tidings
were
mostly
sad
and
ominous
of
gathering
darkness
the
wars
of
men
and
the
flight
of
the
elves
at
last
frodo
asked
the
question
that
was
nearest
to
his
heart

'tell
me
gildor
have
you
ever
seen
bilbo
since
he
left
us'

gildor
smiled
'yes'
he
answered
'twice
he
said
farewell
to
us
on
this
very
spot
but
I
saw
him
once
again
far
from
here'
he
would
say
no
more
about
bilbo
and
frodo
fell
silent

'you
do
not
ask
me
or
tell
me
much
that
concerns
yourself
frodo'
said
gildor
'but
I
already
know
a
little
and
I
can
read
more
in
your
face
and
in
the
thought
behind
your
questions
you
are
leaving
the
shire
and
yet
you
doubt
that
you
will
find
what
you
seek
or
accomplish
what
you
intend
or
that
you
will
ever
return
is
not
that
so'

'it
is'
said
frodo
'but
I
thought
my
going
was
a
secret
known
only
to
gandalf
and
my
faithful
sam'
he
looked
down
at
sam
who
was
snoring
gently

'the
secret
will
not
reach
the
enemy
from
us'
said
gildor

'the
enemy'
said
frodo
'then
you
know
why
I
am
leaving
the
shire'

'i
do
not
know
for
what
reason
the
enemy
is
pursuing
you'
answered
gildor
'but
I
perceive
that
he
is

strange
indeed
though
that
seems
to
me
and
I
warn
you
that
peril
is
now
both
before
you
and
behind
you
and
upon
either
side'

'you
mean
the
riders
I
feared
that
they
were
servants
of
the
enemy
what

are

the
black
riders'

'has
gandalf
told
you
nothing'

'nothing
about
such
creatures'

'then
I
think
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
more

lest
terror
should
keep
you
from
your
journey
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
set
out
only
just
in
time
if
indeed
you
are
in
time
you
must
now
make
haste
and
neither
stay
nor
turn
back
for
the
shire
is
no
longer
any
protection
to
you'

'i
cannot
imagine
what
information
could
be
more
terrifying
than
your
hints
and
warnings'
exclaimed
frodo
'i
knew
that
danger
lay
ahead
of
course
but
I
did
not
expect
to
meet
it
in
our
own
shire
can't
a
hobbit
walk
from
the
water
to
the
river
in
peace'

'but
it
is
not
your
own
shire'
said
gildor
'others
dwelt
here
before
hobbits
were
and
others
will
dwell
here
again
when
hobbits
are
no
more
the
wide
world
is
all
about
you
you
can
fence
yourselves
in
but
you
cannot
for
ever
fence
it
out'

'i
know

and
yet
it
has
always
seemed
so
safe
and
familiar
what
can
I
do
now
my
plan
was
to
leave
the
shire
secretly
and
make
my
way
to
rivendell
but
now
my
footsteps
are
dogged
before
ever
I
get
to
buckland'

'i
think
you
should
still
follow
that
plan'
said
gildor
'i
do
not
think
the
road
will
prove
too
hard
for
your
courage
but
if
you
desire
clearer
counsel
you
should
ask
gandalf
I
do
not
know
the
reason
for
your
flight
and
therefore
I
do
not
know
by
what
means
your
pursuers
will
assail
you
these
things
gandalf
must
know
I
suppose
that
you
will
see
him
before
you
leave
the
shire'

'i
hope
so
but
that
is
another
thing
that
makes
me
anxious
I
have
been
expecting
gandalf
for
many
days
he
was
to
have
come
to
hobbiton
at
the
latest
two
nights
ago
but
he
has
never
appeared
now
I
am
wondering
what
can
have
happened
should
I
wait
for
him'

gildor
was
silent
for
a
moment
'i
do
not
like
this
news'
he
said
at
last
'that
gandalf
should
be
late
does
not
bode
well
but
it
is
said

do
not
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
wizards
for
they
are
subtle
and
quick
to
anger

the
choice
is
yours
to
go
or
wait'

'and
it
is
also
said'
answered
frodo
'go

not
to
the
elves
for
counsel
for
they
will
say
both
no
and
yes'


'is
it
indeed'
laughed
gildor
'elves
seldom
give
unguarded
advice
for
advice
is
a
dangerous
gift
even
from
the
wise
to
the
wise
and
all
courses
may
run
ill
but
what
would
you
you
have
not
told
me
all
concerning
yourself
and
how
then
shall
I
choose
better
than
you
but
if
you
demand
advice
I
will
for
friendship's
sake
give
it
I
think
you
should
now
go
at
once
without
delay
and
if
gandalf
does
not
come
before
you
set
out
then
I
also
advise
this
do
not
go
alone
take
such
friends
as
are
trusty
and
willing
now
you
should
be
grateful
for
I
do
not
give
this
counsel
gladly
the
elves
have
their
own
labours
and
their
own
sorrows
and
they
are
little
concerned
with
the
ways
of
hobbits
or
of
any
other
creatures
upon
earth
our
paths
cross
theirs
seldom
by
chance
or
purpose
in
this
meeting
there
may
be
more
than
chance
but
the
purpose
is
not
clear
to
me
and
I
fear
to
say
too
much'

'i
am
deeply
grateful'
said
frodo
'but
I
wish
you
would
tell
me
plainly
what
the
black
riders
are
if
I
take
your
advice
I
may
not
see
gandalf
for
a
long
while
and
I
ought
to
know
what
is
the
danger
that
pursues
me'

'is
it
not
enough
to
know
that
they
are
servants
of
the
enemy'
answered
gildor
'flee
them
speak
no
words
to
them
they
are
deadly
ask
no
more
of
me
but
my
heart
forbodes
that
ere
all
is
ended
you
frodo
son
of
drogo
will
know
more
of
these
fell
things
than
gildor
inglorion
may
elbereth
protect
you'

'but
where
shall
I
find
courage'
asked
frodo
'that
is
what
I
chiefly
need'

'courage
is
found
in
unlikely
places'
said
gildor
'be
of
good
hope
sleep
now
in
the
morning
we
shall
have
gone
but
we
will
send
our
messages
through
the
lands
the
wandering
companies
shall
know
of
your
journey
and
those
that
have
power
for
good
shall
be
on
the
watch
I
name
you
elffriend
and
may
the
stars
shine
upon
the
end
of
your
road
seldom
have
we
had
such
delight
in
strangers
and
it
is
fair
to
hear
words
of
the
ancient
speech
from
the
lips
of
other
wanderers
in
the
world'

frodo
felt
sleep
coming
upon
him
even
as
gildor
finished
speaking
'i
will
sleep
now'
he
said
and
the
elf
led
him
to
a
bower
beside
pippin
and
he
threw
himself
upon
a
bed
and
fell
at
once
into
a
dreamless
slumber


chapter
4


a
short
cut
to
mushrooms


in
the
morning
frodo
woke
refreshed
he
was
lying
in
a
bower
made
by
a
living
tree
with
branches
laced
and
drooping
to
the
ground
his
bed
was
of
fern
and
grass
deep
and
soft
and
strangely
fragrant
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
fluttering
leaves
which
were
still
green
upon
the
tree
he
jumped
up
and
went
out

sam
was
sitting
on
the
grass
near
the
edge
of
the
wood
pippin
was
standing
studying
the
sky
and
weather
there
was
no
sign
of
the
elves

'they
have
left
us
fruit
and
drink
and
bread'
said
pippin
'come
and
have
your
breakfast
the
bread
tastes
almost
as
good
as
it
did
last
night
I
did
not
want
to
leave
you
any
but
sam
insisted'

frodo
sat
down
beside
sam
and
began
to
eat
'what
is
the
plan
for
today'
asked
pippin

'to
walk
to
bucklebury
as
quickly
as
possible'
answered
frodo
and
gave
his
attention
to
the
food

'do
you
think
we
shall
see
anything
of
those
riders'
asked
pippin
cheerfully
under
the
morning
sun
the
prospect
of
seeing
a
whole
troop
of
them
did
not
seem
very
alarming
to
him

'yes
probably'
said
frodo
not
liking
the
reminder
'but
I
hope
to
get
across
the
river
without
their
seeing
us'

'did
you
find
out
anything
about
them
from
gildor'

'not
much

only
hints
and
riddles'
said
frodo
evasively
'did
you
ask
about
the
sniffing'

'we
didn't
discuss
it'
said
frodo
with
his
mouth
full

'you
should
have
I
am
sure
it
is
very
important'


'in
that
case
I
am
sure
gildor
would
have
refused
to
explain
it'
said
frodo
sharply
'and
now
leave
me
in
peace
for
a
bit
I
don't
want
to
answer
a
string
of
questions
while
I
am
eating
I
want
to
think'

'good
heavens'
said
pippin
'at
breakfast'
he
walked
away
towards
the
edge
of
the
green

from
frodo's
mind
the
bright
morning

treacherously
bright
he
thought

had
not
banished
the
fear
of
pursuit
and
he
pondered
the
words
of
gildor
the
merry
voice
of
pippin
came
to
him
he
was
running
on
the
green
turf
and
singing

'no
I
could
not'
he
said
to
himself
'it
is
one
thing
to
take
my
young
friends
walking
over
the
shire
with
me
until
we
are
hungry
and
weary
and
food
and
bed
are
sweet
to
take
them
into
exile
where
hunger
and
weariness
may
have
no
cure
is
quite
another

even
if
they
are
willing
to
come
the
inheritance
is
mine
alone
I
don't
think
I
ought
even
to
take
sam'
he
looked
at
sam
gamgee
and
discovered
that
sam
was
watching
him

'well
sam'
he
said
'what
about
it
I
am
leaving
the
shire
as
soon
as
ever
I
can

in
fact
I
have
made
up
my
mind
now
not
even
to
wait
a
day
at
crickhollow
if
it
can
be
helped'

'very
good
sir'

'you
still
mean
to
come
with
me'

'i
do'

'it
is
going
to
be
very
dangerous
sam
'it
is
already
dangerous
most
likely
neither
of
us
will
come
back'

'if
you
don't
come
back
sir
then
I
shan't
that's
certain'
said
sam

'don't
you
leave
him

they
said
to
me

leave
him

I
said

I
never
mean
to
I
am
going
with
him
if
he
climbs
to
the
moon
and
if
any
of
those
black
rulers
try
to
stop
him
they'll
have
sam
gamgee
to
reckon
with

I
said
they
laughed'

'who
are

they

and
what
are
you
talking
about'

'the
elves
sir
we
had
some
talk
last
night
and
they
seemed
to
know
you
were
going
away
so
I
didn't
see
the
use
of
denying
it
wonderful
folk
elves
sir
wonderful'

'they
are'
said
frodo
'do
you
like
them
still
now
you
have
had
a
closer
view'

'they
seem
a
bit
above
my
likes
and
dislikes
so
to
speak'
answered
sam
slowly
'it
don't
seem
to
matter
what
I
think
about
them
they
are
quite
different
from
what
I
expected

so
old
and
young
and
so
gay
and
sad
as
it
were'

frodo
looked
at
sam
rather
startled
half
expecting
to
see
some
outward
sign
of
the
odd
change
that
seemed
to
have
come
over
him
it
did
not
sound
like
the
voice
of
the
old
sam
gamgee
that
he
thought
he
knew
but
it
looked
like
the
old
sam
gamgee
sitting
there
except
that
his
face
was
unusually
thoughtful

'do
you
feel
any
need
to
leave
the
shire
now

now
that
your
wish
to
see
them
has
come
true
already'
he
asked

'yes
sir
I
don't
know
how
to
say
it
but
after
last
night
I
feel
different
I
seem
to
see
ahead
in
a
kind
of
way
I
know
we
are
going
to
take
a
very
long
road
into
darkness
but
I
know
I
can't
turn
back
it
isn't
to
see
elves
now
nor
dragons
nor
mountains
that
I
want

I
don't
rightly
know
what
I
want
but
I
have
something
to
do
before
the
end
and
it
lies
ahead
not
in
the
shire
I
must
see
it
through
sir
if
you
understand
me'

'i
don't
altogether
but
I
understand
that
gandalf
chose
me
a
good
companion
I
am
content
we
will
go
together'

frodo
finished
his
breakfast
in
silence
then
standing
up
he
looked
over
the
land
ahead
and
called
to
pippin

'all
ready
to
start'
he
said
as
pippin
ran
up
'we
must
be
getting
off
at
once
we
slept
late
and
there
are
a
good
many
miles
to
go'


'you

slept
late
you
mean'
said
pippin
'i
was
up
long
before
and
we
are
only
waiting
for
you
to
finish
eating
and
thinking'


'i
have
finished
both
now
and
I
am
going
to
make
for
bucklebury
ferry
as
quickly
as
possible
I
am
not
going
out
of
the
way
back
to
the
road
we
left
last
night
I
am
going
to
cut
straight
across
country
from
here'

'then
you
are
going
to
fly'
said
pippin
'you
won't
cut
straight
on
foot
anywhere
in
this
country'

'we
can
cut
straighter
than
the
road
anyway'
answered
frodo
'the
ferry
is
east
from
woodhall
but
the
hard
road
curves
away
to
the
left
you
can
see
a
bend
of
it
away
north
over
there
it
goes
round
the
north
end
of
the
marish
so
as
to
strike
the
causeway
from
the
bridge
above
stock
but
that
is
miles
out
of
the
way
we
could
save
a
quarter
of
the
distance
if
we
made
a
line
for
the
ferry
from
where
we
stand'


'short
cuts
make
long
delays'

argued
pippin
'the
country
is
rough
round
here
and
there
are
bogs
and
all
kinds
of
difficulties
down
in
the
marish
I
know
the
land
in
these
parts
and
if
you
are
worrying
about
black
riders
I
can't
see
that
it
is
any
worse
meeting
them
on
a
road
than
in
a
wood
or
a
field'

'it
is
less
easy
to
find
people
in
the
woods
and
fields'
answered
frodo
'and
if
you
are
supposed
to
be
on
the
road
there
is
some
chance
that
you
will
be
looked
for
on
the
road
and
not
off
it'

'all
right'
said
pippin
'i
will
follow
you
into
every
bog
and
ditch
but
it
is
hard
I
had
counted
on
passing
the

golden
perch

at
stock
before
sundown
the
best
beer
in
the
eastfarthing
or
used
to
be
it
is
a
long
time
since
I
tasted
it'

'that
settles
it'
said
frodo
'short
cuts
make
delays
but
inns
make
longer
ones
at
all
costs
we
must
keep
you
away
from
the

golden
perch

we
want
to
get
to
bucklebury
before
dark
what
do
you
say
sam'

'i
will
go
along
with
you
mr
frodo'
said
sam
in
spite
of
private
misgiving
and
a
deep
regret
for
the
best
beer
in
the
eastfarthing

'then
if
we
are
going
to
toil
through
bog
and
briar
let's
go
now'
said
pippin

it
was
already
nearly
as
hot
as
it
had
been
the
day
before
but
clouds
were
beginning
to
come
up
from
the
west
it
looked
likely
to
turn
to
rain
the
hobbits
scrambled
down
a
steep
green
bank
and
plunged
into
the
thick
trees
below
their
course
had
been
chosen
to
leave
woodhall
to
their
left
and
to
cut
slanting
through
the
woods
that
clustered
along
the
eastern
side
of
the
hills
until
they
reached
the
flats
beyond
then
they
could
make
straight
for
the
ferry
over
country
that
was
open
except
for
a
few
ditches
and
fences
frodo
reckoned
they
had
eighteen
miles
to
go
in
a
straight
line

he
soon
found
that
the
thicket
was
closer
and
more
tangled
than
it
had
appeared
there
were
no
paths
in
the
undergrowth
and
they
did
not
get
on
very
fast
when
they
had
struggled
to
the
bottom
of
the
bank
they
found
a
stream
running
down
from
the
hills
behind
in
a
deeply
dug
bed
with
steep
slippery
sides
overhung
with
brambles
most
inconveniently
it
cut
across
the
line
they
had
chosen
they
could
not
jump
over
it
nor
indeed
get
across
it
at
all
without
getting
wet
scratched
and
muddy
they
halted
wondering
what
to
do
'first
check'
said
pippin
smiling
grimly

sam
gamgee
looked
back
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
top
of
the
green
bank
from
which
they
had
climbed
down

'look'
he
said
clutching
frodo
by
the
arm
they
all
looked
and
on
the
edge
high
above
them
they
saw
against
the
sky
a
horse
standing
beside
it
stooped
a
black
figure

they
at
once
gave
up
any
idea
of
going
back
frodo
led
the
way
and
plunged
quickly
into
the
thick
bushes
beside
the
stream
'whew'
he
said
to
pippin
'we
were
both
right
the
short
cut
has
gone
crooked
already
but
we
got
under
cover
only
just
in
time
you've
got
sharp
ears
sam
can
you
hear
anything
coming'

they
stood
still
almost
holding
their
breath
as
they
listened
but
there
was
no
sound
of
pursuit
'i
don't
fancy
he
would
try
bringing
his
horse
down
that
bank'
said
sam
'but
I
guess
he
knows
we
came
down
it
we
had
better
be
going
on'

going
on
was
not
altogether
easy
they
had
packs
to
carry
and
the
bushes
and
brambles
were
reluctant
to
let
them
through
they
were
cut
off
from
the
wind
by
the
ridge
behind
and
the
air
was
still
and
stuffy
when
they
forced
their
way
at
last
into
more
open
ground
they
were
hot
and
tired
and
very
scratched
and
they
were
also
no
longer
certain
of
the
direction
in
which
they
were
going
the
banks
of
the
stream
sank
as
it
reached
the
levels
and
became
broader
and
shallower
wandering
off
towards
the
marish
and
the
river

'why
this
is
the
stockbrook'
said
pippin
'if
we
are
going
to
try
and
get
back
on
to
our
course
we
must
cross
at
once
and
bear
right'

they
waded
the
stream
and
hurried
over
a
wide
open
space
rushgrown
and
treeless
on
the
further
side
beyond
that
they
came
again
to
a
belt
of
trees
tall
oaks
for
the
most
part
with
here
and
there
an
elm
tree
or
an
ash
the
ground
was
fairly
level
and
there
was
little
undergrowth
but
the
trees
were
loo
close
for
them
to
see
far
ahead
the
leaves
blew
upwards
in
sudden
gusts
of
wind
and
spots
of
rain
began
to
fall
from
the
overcast
sky
then
the
wind
died
away
and
the
rain
came
streaming
down
they
trudged
along
as
fast
as
they
could
over
patches
of
grass
and
through
thick
drifts
of
old
leaves
and
all
about
them
the
rain
pattered
and
trickled
they
did
not
talk
but
kept
glancing
back
and
from
side
to
side

after
half
an
hour
pippin
said
'i
hope
we
have
not
turned
too
much
towards
the
south
and
are
not
walking
longwise
through
this
wood
it
is
not
a
very
broad
belt
I
should
have
said
no
more
than
a
mile
at
the
widest

and
we
ought
to
have
been
through
it
by
now'

'it
is
no
good
our
starting
to
go
in
zigzags'
said
frodo
'that
won't
mend
matters
let
us
keep
on
as
we
are
going
I
am
not
sure
that
I
want
to
come
out
into
the
open
yet'

they
went
on
for
perhaps
another
couple
of
miles
then
the
sun
gleamed
out
of
ragged
clouds
again
and
the
rain
lessened
it
was
now
past
midday
and
they
felt
it
was
high
time
for
lunch
they
halted
under
an
elm
tree
its
leaves
though
fast
turning
yellow
were
still
thick
and
the
ground
at
its
feel
was
fairly
dry
and
sheltered
when
they
came
to
make
their
meal
they
found
that
the
elves
had
filled
their
bottles
with
a
clear
drink
pale
golden
in
colour
it
had
the
scent
of
a
honey
made
of
many
flowers
and
was
wonderfully
refreshing
very
soon
they
were
laughing
and
snapping
their
fingers
at
rain
and
at
black
riders
the
last
few
miles
they
felt
would
soon
be
behind
them

frodo
propped
his
back
against
the
treetrunk
and
closed
his
eyes
sam
and
pippin
sat
near
and
they
began
to
hum
and
then
to
sing
softly

ho
ho
ho
to
the
bottle
I
go

to
heal
my
heart
and
drown
my
woe

rain
may
fall
and
wind
may
blow

and
many
miles
be
still
to
go

but
under
a
tall
tree
I
will
lie

and
let
the
clouds
go
sailing
by



ho
ho
ho

they
began
again
louder
they
stopped
short
suddenly
frodo
sprang
to
his
feet
a
longdrawn
wail
came
down
the
wind
like
the
cry
of
some
evil
and
lonely
creature
it
rose
and
fell
and
ended
on
a
high
piercing
note
even
as
they
sat
and
stood
as
if
suddenly
frozen
it
was
answered
by
another
cry
fainter
and
further
off
but
no
less
chilling
to
the
blood
there
was
then
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
leaves

'and
what
do
you
think
that
was'
pippin
asked
at
last
trying
to
speak
lightly
but
quavering
a
little
'if
it
was
a
bird
it
was
one
that
I
never
heard
in
the
shire
before'

'it
was
not
bird
or
beast'
said
frodo
'it
was
a
call
or
a
signal

there
were
words
in
that
cry
though
I
could
not
catch
them
but
no
hobbit
has
such
a
voice'

no
more
was
said
about
it
they
were
all
thinking
of
the
riders
but
no
one
spoke
of
them
they
were
now
reluctant
either
to
stay
or
go
on
but
sooner
or
later
they
had
got
to
get
across
the
open
country
to
the
ferry
and
it
was
best
to
go
sooner
and
in
daylight
in
a
few
moments
they
had
shouldered
their
packs
again
and
were
off


before
long
the
wood
came
to
a
sudden
end
wide
grasslands
stretched
before
them
they
now
saw
that
they
had
in
fact
turned
too
much
to
the
south
away
over
the
flats
they
could
glimpse
the
low
hill
of
bucklebury
across
the
river
but
it
was
now
to
their
left
creeping
cautiously
out
from
the
edge
of
the
trees
they
set
off
across
the
open
as
quickly
as
they
could

at
first
they
felt
afraid
away
from
the
shelter
of
the
wood
far
back
behind
them
stood
the
high
place
where
they
had
breakfasted
frodo
half
expected
to
see
the
small
distant
figure
of
a
horseman
on
the
ridge
dark
against
the
sky
but
there
was
no
sign
of
one
the
sun
escaping
from
the
breaking
clouds
as
it
sank
towards
the
hills
they
had
left
was
now
shining
brightly
again
their
fear
left
them
though
they
still
felt
uneasy
but
the
land
became
steadily
more
tame
and
wellordered
soon
they
came
into
welltended
fields
and
meadows
there
were
hedges
and
gates
and
dikes
for
drainage
everything
seemed
quiet
and
peaceful
just
an
ordinary
corner
of
the
shire
their
spirits
rose
with
every
step
the
line
of
the
river
grew
nearer
and
the
black
riders
began
to
seem
like
phantoms
of
the
woods
now
left
far
behind

they
passed
along
the
edge
of
a
huge
turnipfield
and
came
to
a
stout
gate
beyond
it
a
rutted
lane
ran
between
low
welllaid
hedges
towards
a
distant
clump
of
trees
pippin
stopped

'i
know
these
fields
and
this
gate'
he
said
'this
is
bamfurlong
old
farmer
maggot's
land
that's
his
farm
away
there
in
the
trees'

'one
trouble
after
another'
said
frodo
looking
nearly
as
much
alarmed
as
if
pippin
had
declared
the
lane
was
the
slot
leading
to
a
dragon's
den
the
others
looked
at
him
in
surprise

'what's
wrong
with
old
maggot'
asked
pippin
'he's
a
good
friend
to
all
the
brandy
bucks
of
course
he's
a
terror
to
trespassers
and
keeps
ferocious
dogs

but
after
all
folk
down
here
are
near
the
border
and
have
to
be
more
on
their
guard'

'i
know'
said
frodo
'but
all
the
same'
he
added
with
a
shamefaced
laugh
'i
am
terrified
of
him
and
his
dogs
I
have
avoided
his
farm
for
years
and
years
he
caught
me
several
times
trespassing
after
mushrooms
when
I
was
a
youngster
at
brandy
hall
on
the
last
occasion
he
beat
me
and
then
took
me
and
showed
me
to
his
dogs
see
lads
he
said
next
time
this
young
varmint
sets
foot
on
my
land
you
can
eat
him
now
see
him
off
they
chased
me
all
the
way
to
the
ferry
I
have
never
got
over
the
fright

though
I
daresay
the
beasts
knew
their
business
and
would
not
really
have
touched
me'

pippin
laughed
'well
it's
time
you
made
it
up
especially
if
you
are
coming
back
to
live
in
buckland
old
maggot
is
really
a
stout
fellow

if
you
leave
his
mushrooms
alone
let's
get
into
the
lane
and
then
we
shan't
be
trespassing
if
we
meet
him
i'll
do
the
talking
he
is
a
friend
of
merry's
and
I
used
to
come
here
with
him
a
good
deal
at
one
time'

they
went
along
the
lane
until
they
saw
the
thatched
roofs
of
a
large
house
and
farmbuildings
peeping
out
among
the
trees
ahead
the
maggots
and
the
puddifoots
of
stock
and
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
marish
were
housedwellers
and
this
farm
was
stoutly
built
of
brick
and
had
a
high
wall
all
round
it
there
was
a
wide
wooden
gate
opening
out
of
the
wall
into
the
lane

suddenly
as
they
drew
nearer
a
terrific
baying
and
barking
broke
out
and
a
loud
voice
was
heard
shouting
'grip
fang
wolf
come
on
lads'

frodo
and
sam
stopped
dead
but
pippin
walked
on
a
few
paces
the
gate
opened
and
three
huge
dogs
came
pelting
out
into
the
lane
and
dashed
towards
the
travellers
barking
fiercely
they
took
no
notice
of
pippin
but
sam
shrank
against
the
wall
while
two
wolvishlooking
dogs
sniffed
at
him
suspiciously
and
snarled
if
he
moved
the
largest
and
most
ferocious
of
the
three
halted
in
front
of
frodo
bristling
and
growling

through
the
gate
there
now
appeared
a
broad
thickset
hobbit
with
a
round
red
face
'hallo
hallo
and
who
may
you
be
and
what
may
you
be
wanting'
he
asked

'good
afternoon
mr
maggot'
said
pippin

the
farmer
looked
at
him
closely
'well
if
it
isn't
master
pippin

mr
peregrin
took
I
should
say'
he
cried
changing
from
a
scowl
to
a
grin
'it's
a
long
time
since
I
saw
you
round
here
it's
lucky
for
you
that
I
know
you
I
was
just
going
out
to
set
my
dogs
on
any
strangers
there
are
some
funny
things
going
on
today
of
course
we
do
get
queer
folk
wandering
in
these
parts
at
times
too
near
the
river'
he
said
shaking
his
head
'but
this
fellow
was
the
most
outlandish
I
have
ever
set
eyes
on
he
won't
cross
my
land
without
leave
a
second
time
not
if
I
can
stop
it'

'what
fellow
do
you
mean'
asked
pippin

'then
you
haven't
seen
him'
said
the
farmer
'he
went
up
the
lane
towards
the
causeway
not
a
long
while
back
he
was
a
funny
customer
and
asking
funny
questions
but
perhaps
you'll
come
along
inside
and
we'll
pass
the
news
more
comfortable
i've
a
drop
of
good
ale
on
tap
if
you
and
your
friends
are
willing
mr
took'

it
seemed
plain
that
the
farmer
would
tell
them
more
if
allowed
to
do
it
in
his
own
time
and
fashion
so
they
all
accepted
the
invitation
'what
about
the
dogs'
asked
frodo
anxiously

the
farmer
laughed
'they
won't
harm
you

not
unless
I
tell
'em
to
here
grip
fang
heel'
he
cried
'heel
wolf'
to
the
relief
of
frodo
and
sam
the
dogs
walked
away
and
let
them
go
free

pippin
introduced
the
other
two
to
the
farmer
'mr
frodo
baggins'
he
said
'you
may
not
remember
him
but
he
used
to
live
at
brandy
hall'
at
the
name
baggins
the
farmer
started
and
gave
frodo
a
sharp
glance
for
a
moment
frodo
thought
that
the
memory
of
stolen
mushrooms
had
been
aroused
and
that
the
dogs
would
be
told
to
see
him
off
but
farmer
maggot
took
him
by
the
arm

'well
if
that
isn't
queerer
than
ever'
he
exclaimed
'mr
baggins
is
it
come
inside
we
must
have
a
talk'

they
went
into
the
farmer's
kitchen
and
sat
by
the
wide
fireplace
mrs
maggot
brought
out
beer
in
a
huge
jug
and
filled
four
large
mugs
it
was
a
good
brew
and
pippin
found
himself
more
than
compensated
for
missing
the

golden
perch

sam
sipped
his
beer
suspiciously
he
had
a
natural
mistrust
of
the
inhabitants
of
other
parts
of
the
shire
and
also
he
was
not
disposed
to
be
quick
friends
with
anyone
who
had
beaten
his
master
however
long
ago

after
a
few
remarks
about
the
weather
and
the
agricultural
prospects
which
were
no
worse
than
usual
farmer
maggot
put
down
his
mug
and
looked
at
them
all
in
turn

'now
mr
peregrin'
he
said
'where
might
you
be
coming
from
and
where
might
you
be
going
to
were
you
coming
to
visit'
me
for
if
so
you
had
gone
past
my
gate
without
my
seeing
you'

'well
no'
answered
pippin
'to
tell
you
the
truth
since
you
have
guessed
it
we
got
into
the
lane
from
the
other
end
we
had
come
over
your
fields
but
that
was
quite
by
accident
we
lost
our
way
in
the
woods
back
near
woodhall
trying
to
take
a
short
cut
to
the
ferry'

'if
you
were
in
a
hurry
the
road
would
have
served
you
better'
said
the
farmer
'but
I
wasn't
worrying
about
that
you
have
leave
to
walk
over
my
land
if
you
have
a
mind
mr
peregrin
and
you
mr
baggins

though
I
daresay
you
still
like
mushrooms'
he
laughed
'ah
yes
I
recognized
the
name
I
recollect
the
time
when
young
frodo
baggins
was
one
of
the
worst
young
rascals
of
buckland
but
it
wasn't
mushrooms
I
was
thinking
of
I
had
just
heard
the
name
baggins
before
you
turned
up
what
do
you
think
that
funny
customer
asked
me'

they
waited
anxiously
for
him
to
go
on
'well'
the
farmer
continued
approaching
his
point
with
slow
relish
'he
came
riding
on
a
big
black
horse
in
at
the
gate
which
happened
to
be
open
and
right
up
to
my
door
all
black
he
was
himself
too
and
cloaked
and
hooded
up
as
if
he
did
not
want
to
be
known
now
what
in
the
shire
can
he
want
I
thought
to
myself
we
don't
see
many
of
the
big
folk
over
the
border
and
anyway
I
had
never
heard
of
any
like
this
black
fellow

'
goodday
to
you
I
says
going
out
to
him
this
lane
don't
lead
anywhere
and
wherever
you
may
be
going
your
quickest
way
will
be
back
to
the
road
I
didn't
like
the
looks
of
him
and
when
grip
came
out
he
took
one
sniff
and
let
out
a
yelp
as
if
he
had
been
slung
he
put
down
his
tail
and
bolted
off
howling
the
black
fellow
sat
quite
still

'
I
come
from
yonder
he
said
slow
and
stifflike
pointing
back
west
over

my

fields
if
you
please
have
you
seen

baggins

he
asked
in
a
queer
voice
and
bent
down
towards
me
I
could
not
see
any
face
for
his
hood
fell
down
so
low
and
I
felt
a
sort
of
shiver
down
my
back
but
I
did
not
see
why
he
should
come
riding
over
my
land
so
bold


'
be
off
I
said
there
are
no
bagginses
here
you're
in
the
wrong
part
of
the
shire
you
had
better
go
back
west
to
hobbiton

but
you
can
go
by
road
this
time

'
baggins
has
left
he
answered
in
a
whisper
he
is
coming
he
is
not
far
away
I
wish
to
find
him
if
he
passes
will
you
tell
me
I
will
come
back
with
gold

'
no
you
won't
I
said
you'll
go
back
where
you
belong
double
quick
I
give
you
one
minute
before
I
call
all
my
dogs

'he
gave
a
sort
of
hiss
it
might
have
been
laughing
and
it
might
not
then
he
spurred
his
great
horse
right
at
me
and
I
jumped
out
of
the
way
only
just
in
time
I
called
the
dogs
but
he
swung
off
and
rode
through
the
gate
and
up
the
lane
towards
the
causeway
like
a
bolt
of
thunder
what
do
you
think
of
that'

frodo
sat
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
fire
but
his
only
thought
was
how
on
earth
would
they
reach
the
ferry
'i
don't
know
what
to
think'
he
said
at
last

'then
i'll
tell
you
what
to
think'
said
maggot
'you
should
never
have
gone
mixing
yourself
up
with
hobbiton
folk
mr
frodo
folk
are
queer
up
there'
sam
stirred
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
the
farmer
with
an
unfriendly
eye
'but
you
were
always
a
reckless
lad
when
I
heard
you
had
left
the
brandybucks
and
gone
off
to
that
old
mr
bilbo
I
said
that
you
were
going
to
find
trouble
mark
my
words
this
all
comes
of
those
strange
doings
of
mr
bilbo's
his
money
was
got
in
some
strange
fashion
in
foreign
parts
they
say
maybe
there
is
some
that
want
to
know
what
has
become
of
the
gold
and
jewels
that
he
buried
in
the
hill
of
hobbiton
as
I
hear'

frodo
said
nothing
the
shrewd
guesses
of
the
farmer
were
rather
disconcerting

'well
mr
frodo'
maggot
went
on
'i'm
glad
that
you've
had
the
sense
to
come
back
to
buckland
my
advice
is
stay
there
and
don't
get
mixed
up
with
these
outlandish
folk
you'll
have
friends
in
these
parts
if
any
of
these
black
fellows
come
after
you
again
i'll
deal
with
them
i'll
say
you're
dead
or
have
left
the
shire
or
anything
you
like
and
that
might
be
true
enough
for
as
like
as
not
it
is
old
mr
bilbo
they
want
news
of'

'maybe
you're
right'
said
frodo
avoiding
the
farmer's
eye
and
staring
at
the
fire

maggot
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
'well
I
see
you
have
ideas
of
your
own'
he
said
'it
is
as
plain
as
my
nose
that
no
accident
brought
you
and
that
rider
here
on
the
same
afternoon
and
maybe
my
news
was
no
great
news
to
you
after
all
I
am
not
asking
you
to
tell
me
anything
you
have
a
mind
to
keep
to
yourself
but
I
see
you
are
in
some
kind
of
trouble
perhaps
you
are
thinking
it
won't
be
too
easy
to
get
to
the
ferry
without
being
caught'

'i
was
thinking
so'
said
frodo
'but
we
have
got
to
try
and
get
there
and
it
won't
be
done
by
sitting
and
thinking
so
I
am
afraid
we
must
be
going
thank
you
very
much
indeed
for
your
kindness
i've
been
in
terror
of
you
and
your
dogs
for
over
thirty
years
farmer
maggot
though
you
may
laugh
to
hear
it
it's
a
pity
for
i've
missed
a
good
friend
and
now
i'm
sorry
to
leave
so
soon
but
i'll
come
back
perhaps
one
day

if
I
get
a
chance'

'you'll
be
welcome
when
you
come'
said
maggot
'but
now
i've
a
notion
it's
near
sundown
already
and
we
are
going
to
have
our
supper
for
we
mostly
go
to
bed
soon
after
the
sun
if
you
and
mr
peregrin
and
all
could
stay
and
have
a
bite
with
us
we
would
be
pleased'

'and
so
should
we'
said
frodo
'but
we
must
be
going
at
once
i'm
afraid
even
now
it
will
be
dark
before
we
can
reach
the
ferry'

'ah
but
wait
a
minute
I
was
going
to
say
after
a
bit
of
supper
i'll
gel
out
a
small
waggon
and
i'll
drive
you
all
to
the
ferry
that
will
save
you
a
good
step
and
it
might
also
save
you
trouble
of
another
sort'

frodo
now
accepted
the
invitation
gratefully
to
the
relief
of
pippin
and
sam
the
sun
was
already
behind
the
western
hills
and
the
light
was
failing
two
of
maggot's
sons
and
his
three
daughters
came
in
and
a
generous
supper
was
laid
on
the
large
table
the
kitchen
was
lit
with
candles
and
the
fire
was
mended
mrs
maggot
hustled
in
and
out
one
or
two
other
hobbits
belonging
to
the
farmhousehold
came
in
in
a
short
while
fourteen
sat
down
to
eat
there
was
beer
in
plenty
and
a
mighty
dish
of
mushrooms
and
bacon
besides
much
other
solid
farmhouse
fare
the
dogs
lay
by
the
fire
and
gnawed
rinds
and
cracked
bones

when
they
had
finished
the
farmer
and
his
sons
went
out
with
a
lantern
and
got
the
waggon
ready
it
was
dark
in
the
yard
when
the
guests
came
out
they
threw
their
packs
on
board
and
climbed
in
the
farmer
sat
in
the
drivingseat
and
whipped
up
his
two
stout
ponies
his
wife
stood
in
the
light
of
the
open
door

'you
be
careful
of
yourself
maggot'
she
called
'don't
go
arguing
with
any
foreigners
and
come
straight
back'

'i
will'
said
he
and
drove
out
of
the
gate
there
was
now
no
breath
of
wind
stirring
the
night
was
still
and
quiet
and
a
chill
was
in
the
air
they
went
without
lights
and
took
it
slowly
after
a
mile
or
two
the
lane
came
to
an
end
crossing
a
deep
dike
and
climbing
a
short
slope
up
on
to
the
highbanked
causeway

maggot
got
down
and
took
a
good
look
either
way
north
and
south
but
nothing
could
be
seen
in
the
darkness
and
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
still
air
thin
strands
of
rivermist
were
hanging
above
the
dikes
and
crawling
over
the
fields

'it's
going
to
be
thick'
said
maggot
'but
i'll
not
light
my
lantern
till
I
turn
for
home
we'll
hear
anything
on
the
road
long
before
we
meet
it
tonight'

it
was
five
miles
or
more
from
maggot's
lane
to
the
ferry
the
hobbits
wrapped
themselves
up
but
their
ears
were
strained
for
any
sound
above
the
creak
of
the
wheels
and
the
slow

clop

of
the
ponies'
hoofs
the
waggon
seemed
slower
than
a
snail
to
frodo
beside
him
pippin
was
nodding
towards
sleep
but
sam
was
staring
forwards
into
the
rising
fog

they
reached
the
entrance
to
the
ferry
lane
at
last
it
was
marked
by
two
tall
white
posts
that
suddenly
loomed
up
on
their
right
farmer
maggot
drew
in
his
ponies
and
the
waggon
creaked
to
a
halt
they
were
just
beginning
lo
scramble
out
when
suddenly
they
heard
what
they
had
all
been
dreading
hoofs
on
the
road
ahead
the
sound
was
coming
towards
them

maggot
jumped
down
and
stood
holding
the
ponies'
heads
and
peering
forward
into
the
gloom

clipclop
clipclop

came
the
approaching
rider
the
fall
of
the
hoofs
sounded
loud
in
the
still
foggy
air

'you'd
better
be
hidden
mr
frodo'
said
sam
anxiously
'you
get
down
in
the
waggon
and
cover
up
with
blankets
and
we'll
send
this
rider
to
the
rightabouts'
he
climbed
out
and
went
to
the
farmer's
side
black
riders
would
have
to
ride
over
him
to
get
near
the
waggon


clopclop
clopclop

the
rider
was
nearly
on
them

'hallo
there'
called
farmer
maggot
the
advancing
hoofs
stopped
short
they
thought
they
could
dimly
guess
a
dark
cloaked
shape
in
the
mist
a
yard
or
two
ahead
'now
then'
said
the
farmer
throwing
the
reins
to
sam
and
striding
forward
'don't
you
come
a
step
nearer
what
do
you
want
and
where
are
you
going'

'i
want
mr
baggins
have
you
seen
him'
said
a
muffled
voice

but
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
merry
brandybuck
a
dark
lantern
was
uncovered
and
its
light
fell
on
the
astonished
face
of
the
farmer

'mr
merry'
he
cried

'yes
of
course
who
did
you
think
it
was'
said
merry
coming
forward
as
he
came
out
of
the
mist
and
their
fears
subsided
he
seemed
suddenly
to
diminish
to
ordinary
hobbitsize
he
was
riding
a
pony
and
a
scarf
was
swathed
round
his
neck
and
over
his
chin
to
keep
out
the
fog

frodo
sprang
out
of
the
waggon
to
greet
him
'so
there
you
are
at
last'
said
merry
'i
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
you
would
turn
up
at
all
today
and
I
was
just
going
back
to
supper
when
it
grew
foggy
I
came
across
and
rode
up
towards
stock
to
see
if
you
had
fallen
in
any
ditches
but
i'm
blest
if
I
know
which
way
you
have
come
where
did
you
find
them
mr
maggot
in
your
duckpond'


'no
I
caught
'em
trespassing'
said
the
farmer
'and
nearly
set
my
dogs
on
'em
but
they'll
tell
you
all
the
story
i've
no
doubt
now
if
you'll
excuse
me
mr
merry
and
mr
frodo
and
all
i'd
best
be
turning
for
home
mrs
maggot
will
be
worriting
with
the
night
getting
thick'

he
backed
the
waggon
into
the
lane
and
turned
it
'well
good
night
to
you
all'
he
said
'it's
been
a
queer
day
and
no
mistake
but
all's
well
as
ends
well
though
perhaps
we
should
not
say
that
until
we
reach
our
own
doors
i'll
not
deny
that
i'll
be
glad
now
when
I
do'
he
lit
his
lanterns
and
got
up
suddenly
he
produced
a
large
basket
from
under
the
seat
'i
was
nearly
forgetting'
he
said
'mrs
maggot
put
this
up
for
mr
baggins
with
her
compliments'
he
handed
it
down
and
moved
off
followed
by
a
chorus
of
thanks
and
goodnights

they
watched
the
pale
rings
of
light
round
his
lanterns
as
they
dwindled
into
the
foggy
night
suddenly
frodo
laughed
from
the
covered
basket
he
held
the
scent
of
mushrooms
was
rising


chapter
5


a
conspiracy
unmasked


'now
we
had
better
get
home
ourselves'
said
merry
there's
something
funny
about
all
this
I
see
but
it
must
wait
till
we
get
in'

they
turned
down
the
ferry
lane
which
was
straight
and
wellkept
and
edged
with
large
whitewashed
stones
in
a
hundred
yards
or
so
it
brought
them
to
the
riverbank
where
there
was
a
broad
wooden
landingstage
a
large
flat
ferryboat
was
moored
beside
it
the
white
bollards
near
the
water's
edge
glimmered
in
the
light
of
two
lamps
on
high
posts
behind
them
the
mists
in
the
flat
fields
were
now
above
the
hedges
but
the
water
before
them
was
dark
with
only
a
few
curling
wisps
like
steam
among
the
reeds
by
the
bank
there
seemed
to
be
less
fog
on
the
further
side

merry
led
the
pony
over
a
gangway
on
to
the
ferry
and
the
others
followed
merry
then
pushed
slowly
off
with
a
long
pole
the
brandywine
flowed
slow
and
broad
before
them
on
the
other
side
the
bank
was
steep
and
up
it
a
winding
path
climbed
from
the
further
landing
lamps
were
twinkling
there
behind
loomed
up
the
buck
hill
and
out
of
it
through
stray
shrouds
of
mist
shone
many
round
windows
yellow
and
red
they
were
the
windows
of
brandy
hall
the
ancient
home
of
the
brandybucks

long
ago
gorhendad
oldbuck
head
of
the
oldbuck
family
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
marish
or
indeed
in
the
shire
had
crossed
the
river
which
was
the
original
boundary
of
the
land
eastwards
he
built
and
excavated
brandy
hall
changed
his
name
to
brandybuck
and
settled
down
to
become
master
of
what
was
virtually
a
small
independent
country
his
family
grew
and
grew
and
after
his
days
continued
to
grow
until
brandy
hall
occupied
the
whole
of
the
low
hill
and
had
three
large
frontdoors
many
sidedoors
and
about
a
hundred
windows
the
brandybucks
and
their
numerous
dependants
then
began
to
burrow
and
later
to
build
all
round
about
that
was
the
origin
of
buckland
a
thickly
inhabited
strip
between
the
river
and
the
old
forest
a
sort
of
colony
from
the
shire
its
chief
village
was
bucklebury
clustering
in
the
banks
and
slopes
behind
brandy
hall

the
people
in
the
marish
were
friendly
with
the
bucklanders
and
the
authority
of
the
master
of
the
hall
as
the
head
of
the
brandybuck
family
was
called
was
still
acknowledged
by
the
farmers
between
stock
and
rushey
but
most
of
the
folk
of
the
old
shire
regarded
the
bucklanders
as
peculiar
half
foreigners
as
it
were
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
not
very
different
from
the
other
hobbits
of
the
four
farthings
except
in
one
point
they
were
fond
of
boats
and
some
of
them
could
swim

their
land
was
originally
unprotected
from
the
east
but
on
that
side
they
had
built
a
hedge
the
high
hay
it
had
been
planted
many
generations
ago
and
was
now
thick
and
tail
for
it
was
constantly
tended
it
ran
all
the
way
from
brandywine
bridge
in
a
big
loop
curving
away
from
the
river
to
haysend
where
the
withywindle
flowed
out
of
the
forest
into
the
brandywine
well
over
twenty
miles
from
end
to
end
but
of
course
it
was
not
a
complete
protection
the
forest
drew
close
to
the
hedge
in
many
places
the
bucklanders
kept
their
doors
locked
after
dark
and
that
also
was
not
usual
in
the
shire

the
ferryboat
moved
slowly
across
the
water
the
buckland
shore
drew
nearer
sam
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
had
not
been
over
the
river
before
he
had
a
strange
feeling
as
the
slow
gurgling
stream
slipped
by
his
old
life
lay
behind
in
the
mists
dark
adventure
lay
in
front
he
scratched
his
head
and
for
a
moment
had
a
passing
wish
that
mr
frodo
could
have
gone
on
living
quietly
at
bag
end

the
four
hobbits
stepped
off
the
ferry
merry
was
tying
it
up
and
pippin
was
already
leading
the
pony
up
the
path
when
sam
who
had
been
looking
back
as
if
to
take
farewell
of
the
shire
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper

'look
back
mr
frodo
do
you
see
anything'

on
the
far
stage
under
the
distant
lamps
they
could
just
make
out
a
figure
it
looked
like
a
dark
black
bundle
left
behind
but
as
they
looked
it
seemed
to
move
and
sway
this
way
and
that
as
if
searching
the
ground
it
then
crawled
or
went
crouching
back
into
the
gloom
beyond
the
lamps

'what
in
the
shire
is
that'
exclaimed
merry

'something
that
is
following
us'
said
frodo
'but
don't
ask
any
more
now
let's
get
away
at
once'
they
hurried
up
the
path
to
the
top
of
the
bank
but
when
they
looked
back
the
far
shore
was
shrouded
in
mist
and
nothing
could
be
seen

'thank
goodness
you
don't
keep
any
boats
on
the
westbank'
said
frodo
'can
horses
cross
the
river'

'they
can
go
twenty
miles
north
to
brandywine
bridge

or
they
might
swim'
answered
merry
'though
I
never
heard
of
any
horse
swimming
the
brandywine
but
what
have
horses
to
do
with
it'
i'll
tell
you
later
let's
get
indoors
and
then
we
can
talk'

'all
right
you
and
pippin
know
your
way
so
i'll
just
ride
on
and
tell
fatty
bolger
that
you
are
coming
we'll
see
about
supper
and
things'

'we
had
our
supper
early
with
farmer
maggot'
said
frodo
'but
we
could
do
with
another'

'you
shall
have
it
give
me
that
basket'
said
merry
and
rode
ahead
into
the
darkness

it
was
some
distance
from
the
brandywine
to
frodo's
new
house
at
crickhollow
they
passed

hill
and
brandy
hall
on
their
left
and
on
the
outskirts
of
bucklebury
struck
the
main
road
of
buckland
that
ran
south
from
the
bridge
half
a
mile
northward
along
this
they
came
to
a
lane
opening
on
their
right
this
they
followed
for
a
couple
of
miles
as
it
climbed
up
and
down
into
the
country

at
last
they
came
to
a
narrow
gate
in
a
thick
hedge
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
house
in
the
dark
it
stood
back
from
the
lane
in
the
middle
of
a
wide
circle
of
lawn
surrounded
by
a
belt
of
low
trees
inside
the
outer
hedge
frodo
had
chosen
it
because
it
stood
in
an
outoftheway
corner
of
the
country
and
there
were
no
other
dwellings
close
by
you
could
get
in
and
out
without
being
noticed
it
had
been
built
a
long
while
before
by
the
brandybucks
for
the
use
of
guests
or
members
of
the
family
that
wished
to
escape
from
the
crowded
life
of
brandy
hall
for
a
time
it
was
an
oldfashioned
countrified
house
as
much
like
a
hobbithole
as
possible
it
was
long
and
low
with
no
upper
storey
and
it
had
a
roof
of
turf
round
windows
and
a
large
round
door

as
they
walked
lip
the
green
path
from
the
gate
no
light
was
visible
the
windows
were
dark
and
shuttered
frodo
knocked
on
the
door
and
fatty
bolger
opened
it
a
friendly
light
streamed
out
they
slipped
in
quickly
and
shut
themselves
and
the
light
inside
they
were
in
a
wide
hall
with
doors
on
either
side
in
front
of
them
a
passage
ran
back
down
the
middle
of
the
house

'well
what
do
you
think
of
it'
asked
merry
coming
up
the
passage
'we
have
done
our
best
in
a
short
time
to
make
it
look
like
home
after
all
fatty
and
I
only
got
here
with
the
last
cartload
yesterday'

frodo
looked
round
it
did
look
like
home
many
of
his
own
favourite
things

or
bilbo's
things
they
reminded
him
sharply
of
him
in
their
new
selling

were
arranged
as
nearly
as
possible
as
they
had
been
at
bag
end
it
was
a
pleasant
comfortable
welcoming
place
and
he
found
himself
wishing
that
he
was
really
coming
here
to
settle
down
in
quiet
retirement
it
seemed
unfair
to
have
put
his
friends
to
all
this
trouble
and
he
wondered
again
how
he
was
going
to
break
the
news
to
them
that
he
must
leave
them
so
soon
indeed
at
once
yet
that
would
have
to
be
done
that
very
night
before
they
all
went
to
bed

'it's
delightful'
he
said
with
an
effort
'i
hardly
feel
that
I
have
moved
at
all'

the
travellers
hung
up
their
cloaks
and
piled
their
packs
on
the
floor
merry
led
them
down
the
passage
and
threw
open
a
door
at
the
far
end
firelight
came
out
and
a
puff
of
steam

'a
bath'
cried
pippin
'o
blessed
meriadoc'

'which
order
shall
we
go
in'
said
frodo
'eldest
first
or
quickest
first
you'll
be
last
either
way
master
peregrin'

'trust
me
to
arrange
things
better
than
that'
said
merry
'we
can't
begin
life
at
crickhollow
with
a
quarrel
over
baths
in
that
room
there
are

three

tubs
and
a
copper
full
of
boiling
water
there
are
also
towels
mats
and
soap
get
inside
and
be
quick'

merry
and
fatty
went
into
the
kitchen
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
and
busied
themselves
with
the
final
preparations
for
a
late
supper
snatches
of
competing
songs
came
from
the
bathroom
mixed
with
the
sound
of
splashing
and
wallowing
the
voice
of
pippin
was
suddenly
lifted
up
above
the
others
in
one
of
bilbo's
favourite
bathsongs

sing
hey
for
the
bath
at
close
of
day

that
washes
the
weary
mud
away

a
loon
is
he
that
will
not
sing

o
water
hot
is
a
noble
thing

o
sweet
is
the
sound
of
falling
rain

and
the
brook
that
leaps
from
hill
to
plain

but
better
than
rain
or
rippling
streams

is
water
hot
that
smokes
and
steams

o
water
cold
we
may
pour
at
need

down
a
thirsty
throat
and
be
glad
indeed

but
better
is
beer
if
drink
we
lack

and
water
hot
poured
down
the
back

o
water
is
fair
that
leaps
on
high

in
a
fountain
white
beneath
the
sky

but
never
did
fountain
sound
so
sweet

as
splashing
hot
water
with
my
feet

there
was
a
terrific
splash
and
a
shout
of

whoa

from
frodo
it
appeared
that
a
lot
of
pippin's
bath
had
imitated
a
fountain
and
leaped
on
high

merry
went
to
the
door
'what
about
supper
and
beer
in
the
throat'
he
called
frodo
came
out
drying
his
hair

'there's
so
much
water
in
the
air
that
i'm
coming
into
the
kitchen
to
finish'
he
said

'lawks'
said
merry
looking
in
the
stone
floor
was
swimming
'you
ought
to
mop
all
that
up
before
you
get
anything
to
eat
peregrin'
he
said
'hurry
up
or
we
shan't
wait
for
you'

they
had
supper
in
the
kitchen
on
a
table
near
the
fire
'i
suppose
you
three
won't
want
mushrooms
again'
said
fredegar
without
much
hope

'yes
we
shall'
cried
pippin


'they're
mine'
said
frodo
'given
to

me

by
mrs
maggot
a
queen
among
farmers'
wives
take
your
greedy
hands
away
and
i'll
serve
them'

hobbits
have
a
passion
for
mushrooms
surpassing
even
the
greediest
likings
of
big
people
a
fact
which
partly
explains
young
frodo's
long
expeditions
to
the
renowned
fields
of
the
marish
and
the
wrath
of
the
injured
maggot
on
this
occasion
there
was
plenty
for
all
even
according
to
hobbit
standards
there
were
also
many
other
things
to
follow
and
when
they
had
finished
even
fatty
bolger
heaved
a
sigh
of
content
they
pushed
back
the
table
and
drew
chairs
round
the
fire

'we'll
clear
up
later'
said
merry
'now
tell
me
all
about
it
I
guess
that
you
have
been
having
adventures
which
was
not
quite
fair
without
me
I
want
a
full
account
and
most
of
all
I
want
to
know
what
was
the
matter
with
old
maggot
and
why
he
spoke
to
me
like
that
he
sounded
almost
as
if
he
was

scared

if
that
is
possible'

'we
have
all
been
scared'
said
pippin
after
a
pause
in
which
frodo
stared
at
the
fire
and
did
not
speak
'you
would
have
been
too
if
you
had
been
chased
for
two
days
by
black
riders'

'and
what
are
they'

'black
figures
riding
on
black
horses'
answered
pippin
'if
frodo
won't
talk
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
tale
from
the
beginning'
he
then
gave
a
full
account
of
their
journey
from
the
time
when
they
left
hobbiton
sam
gave
various
supporting
nods
and
exclamations
frodo
remained
silent

'i
should
think
you
were
making
it
all
up'
said
merry
'if
I
had
not
seen
that
black
shape
on
the
landingstage

and
heard
the
queer
sound
in
maggot's
voice
what
do
you
make
of
it
all
frodo'

'cousin
frodo
has
been
very
close'
said
pippin
'but
the
time
has
come
for
him
to
open
out
so
far
we
have
been
given
nothing
more
to
go
on
than
farmer
maggot's
guess
that
it
has
something
to
do
with
old
bilbo's
treasure'

'that
was
only
a
guess'
said
frodo
hastily
'maggot
does
not

know
anything'

'old
maggot
is
a
shrewd
fellow'
said
merry
'a
lot
goes
on
behind
his
round
face
that
does
not
come
out
in
his
talk
i've
heard
that
he
used
to
go
into
the
old
forest
at
one
time
and
he
has
the
reputation
of
knowing
a
good
many
strange
things
but
you
can
at
least
tell
us
frodo
whether
you
think
his
guess
good
or
bad'

'i

think'

answered
frodo
slowly
'that
it
was
a
good
guess
as
far
as
it
goes
there

is
a

connexion
with
bilbo's
old
adventures
and
the
riders
are
looking
or
perhaps
one
ought
to
say

searching

for
him
or
for
me
I
also
fear
if
you
want
to
know
that
it
is
no
joke
at
all
and
that
I
am
not
safe
here
or
anywhere
else'
he
looked
round
at
the
windows
and
walls
as
if
he
was
afraid
they
would
suddenly
give
way
the
others
looked
at
him
in
silence
and
exchanged
meaning
glances
among
themselves

'it's
coming
out
in
a
minute'
whispered
pippin
to
merry
merry
nodded

'well'
said
frodo
at
last
sitting
up
and
straightening
his
back
as
if
he
had
made
a
decision
'i
can't
keep
it
dark
any
longer
I
have
got
something
to
tell
you
all
but
I
don't
know
quite
how
to
begin'

'i
think
I
could
help
you'
said
merry
quietly
'by
telling
you
some
of
it
myself'

'what
do
you
mean'
said
frodo
looking
at
him
anxiously
'just
this
my
dear
old
frodo
you
are
miserable
because
you
don't
know
how
to
say
goodbye
you
meant
to
leave
the
shire
of
course
but
danger
has
come
on
you
sooner
than
you
expected
and
now
you
are
making
up
your
mind
to
go
at
once
and
you
don't
want
to
we
are
very
sorry
for
you'


frodo
opened
his
mouth
and
shut
it
again
his
look
of
surprise
was
so
comical
that
they
laughed
'dear
old
frodo'
said
pippin
'did
you
really
think
you
had
thrown
dust
in
all
our
eyes
you
have
not
been
nearly
careful
or
clever
enough
for
that
you
have
obviously
been
planning
to
go
and
saying
farewell
to
all
your
haunts
all
this
year
since
april
we
have
constantly
heard
you
muttering
shall
I
ever
look
down
into
that
valley
again
I
wonder
and
things
like
that
and
pretending
that
you
had
come
to
the
end
of
your
money
and
actually
selling
your
beloved
bag
end
to
those
sackvillebagginses
and
all
those
close
talks
with
gandalf'


'good
heavens'
said
frodo
'i
thought
I
had
been
both
careful
and
clever
I
don't
know
what
gandalf
would
say
is
all
the
shire
discussing
my
departure
then'

'oh
no'
said
merry
'don't
worry
about
that
the
secret
won't
keep
for
long
of
course
but
at
present
it
is
I
think
only
known
to
us
conspirators
after
all
you
must
remember
that
we
know
you
well
and
are
often
with
you
we
can
usually
guess
what
you
are
thinking
I
knew
bilbo
too
to
tell
you
the
truth
I
had
been
watching
you
rather
closely
ever
since
he
left
I
thought
you
would
go
after
him
sooner
or
later
indeed
I
expected
you
to
go
sooner
and
lately
we
have
been
very
anxious
we
have
been
terrified
that
you
might
give
us
the
slip
and
go
off
suddenly
all
on
your
own
like
he
did
ever
since
this
spring
we
have
kept
our
eyes
open
and
done
a
good
deal
of
planning
on
our
own
account
you
are
not
going
to
escape
so
easily'

'but
I
must
go'
said
frodo
'it
cannot
be
helped
dear
friends
it
is
wretched
for
us
all
but
it
is
no
use
your
trying
to
keep
me
since
you
have
guessed
so
much
please
help
me
and
do
not
hinder
me'

'you
do
not
understand'
said
pippin
'you
must
go

and
therefore
we
must
too
merry
and
I
are
coming
with
you
sam
is
an
excellent
fellow
and
would
jump
down
a
dragon's
throat
to
save
you
if
he
did
not
trip
over
his
own
feet
but
you
will
need
more
than
one
companion
in
your
dangerous
adventure'

'my
dear
and
most
beloved
hobbits'
said
frodo
deeply
moved
'but
I
could
not
allow
it
I
decided
that
long
ago
too
you
speak
of
danger
but
you
do
not
understand
this
is
no
treasurehunt
no
thereandback
journey
I
am
flying
from
deadly
peril
into
deadly
peril'

'of
course
we
understand'
said
merry
firmly
'that
is
why
we
have
decided
to
come
we
know
the
ring
is
no
laughingmatter
but
we
are
going
to
do
our
best
to
help
you
against
the
enemy'

'the
ring'
said
frodo
now
completely
amazed

'yes
the
ring'
said
merry
'my
dear
old
hobbit
you
don't
allow
for
the
inquisitiveness
of
friends
I
have
known
about
the
existence
of
the
ring
for
years

before
bilbo
went
away
in
fact
but
since
he
obviously
regarded
it
as
secret
I
kept
the
knowledge
in
my
head
until
we
formed
our
conspiracy
I
did
not
know
bilbo
of
course
as
well
as
I
know
you
I
was
too
young
and
he
was
also
more
careful

but
he
was
not
careful
enough
if
you
want
to
know
how
I
first
found
out
I
will
tell
you'

'go
on'
said
frodo
faintly

'it
was
the
sackvillebagginses
that
were
his
downfall
as
you
might
expect
one
day
a
year
before
the
party
I
happened
to
be
walking
along
the
road
when
I
saw
bilbo
ahead
suddenly
in
the
distance
the
sbs
appeared
coming
towards
us
bilbo
slowed
down
and
then
hey
presto
he
vanished
I
was
so
startled
that
I
hardly
had
the
wits
to
hide
myself
in
a
more
ordinary
fashion
but
I
got
through
the
hedge
and
walked
along
the
field
inside
I
was
peeping
through
into
the
road
after
the
sbs
had
passed
and
was
looking
straight
at
bilbo
when
he
suddenly
reappeared
I
caught
a
glint
of
gold
as
he
put
something
back
in
his
trouserpocket

'after
that
I
kept
my
eyes
open
in
fact
I
confess
that
I
spied
but
you
must
admit
that
it
was
very
intriguing
and
I
was
only
in
my
teens
I
must
be
the
only
one
in
the
shire
besides
you
frodo
that
has
ever
seen
the
old
fellow's
secret
book'

'you
have
read
his
book'
cried
frodo
'good
heavens
above
is
nothing
safe'

'not
too
safe
I
should
say'
said
merry
'but
I
have
only
had
one
rapid
glance
and
that
was
difficult
to
get
he
never
left
the
book
about
I
wonder
what
became
of
it
I
should
like
another
look
have
you
got
it
frodo'

'no
it
was
not
at
bag
end
he
must
have
taken
it
away'

'well
as
I
was
saying'
merry
proceeded
'i
kept
my
knowledge
to
myself
till
this
spring
when
things
got
serious
then
we
formed
our
conspiracy
and
as
we
were
serious
too
and
meant
business
we
have
not
been
too
scrupulous
you
are
not
a
very
easy
nut
to
crack
and
gandalf
is
worse
but
if
you
want
to
be
introduced
to
our
chief
investigator
I
can
produce
him'


'where
is
he'
said
frodo
looking
round
as
if
he
expected
a
masked
and
sinister
figure
to
come
out
of
a
cupboard

'step
forward
sam'
said
merry
and
sam
stood
up
with
a
face
scarlet
up
to
the
ears
'here's
our
collector
of
information
and
he
collected
a
lot
I
can
tell
you
before
he
was
finally
caught
after
which
I
may
say
he
seemed
to
regard
himself
as
on
parole
and
dried
up'

'sam'
cried
frodo
feeling
that
amazement
could
go
no
further
and
quite
unable
to
decide
whether
he
felt
angry
amused
relieved
or
merely
foolish

'yes
sir'
said
sam
'begging
your
pardon
sir
but
I
meant
no
wrong
to
you
mr
frodo
nor
to
mr
gandalf
for
that
matter

he

has
some
sense
mind
you
and
when
you
said

go
alone

he
said

no
lake
someone
as
you
can
trust'


'but
it
does
not
seem
that
I
can
trust
anyone'
said
frodo
sam
looked
at
him
unhappily
'it
all
depends
on
what
you
want'
put
in
merry
'you
can
trust
us
to
stick
to
you
through
thick
and
thin

to
the
bitter
end
and
you
can
trust
us
to
keep
any
secret
of
yours

closer
than
you
keep
it
yourself
but
you
cannot
trust
us
to
let
you
face
trouble
alone
and
go
off
without
a
word
we
are
your
friends
frodo
anyway
there
it
is
we
know
most
of
what
gandalf
has
told
you
we
know
a
good
deal
about
the
ring
we
are
horribly
afraid

but
we
are
coming
with
you
or
following
you
like
hounds'

'and
after
all
sir'
added
sam
'you
did
ought
to
take
the
elves'
advice
gildor
said
you
should
take
them
as
was
willing
and
you
can't
deny
it'

'i
don't
deny
it'
said
frodo
looking
at
sam
who
was
now
grinning
'i
don't
deny
it
but
i'll
never
believe
you
are
sleeping
again
whether
you
snore
or
not
I
shall
kick
you
hard
to
make
sure

'you
are
a
set
of
deceitful
scoundrels'
he
said
turning
to
the
others
'but
bless
you'
he
laughed
getting
up
and
waving
his
arms
'i
give
in
I
will
take
gildor's
advice
if
the
danger
were
not
so
dark
I
should
dance
for
joy
even
so
I
cannot
help
feeling
happy
happier
than
I
have
felt
for
a
long
time
I
had
dreaded
this
evening'

'good
that's
settled
three
cheers
for
captain
frodo
and
company'
they
shouted
and
they
danced
round
him
merry
and
pippin
began
a
song
which
they
had
apparently
got
ready
for
the
occasion

it
was
made
on
the
model
of
the
dwarfsong
that
started
bilbo
on
his
adventure
long
ago
and
went
to
the
same
tune

farewell
we
call
to
hearth
and
hall

though
wind
may
blow
and
rain
may
fall

we
must
away
ere
break
of
day

far
over
wood
and
mountain
tall

to
rivendell
where
elves
yet
dwell

in
glades
beneath
the
misty
fell

through
moor
and
waste
we
ride
in
haste

and
whither
then
we
cannot
tell

with
foes
ahead
behind
us
dread

beneath
the
sky
shall
be
our
bed

until
at
last
our
toil
be
passed

our
journey
done
our
errand
sped


we
must
away
we
must
away

we
ride
before
the
break
of
day



'very
good'
said
frodo
'but
in
that
case
there
are
a
lot
of
things
to
do
before
we
go
to
bed

under
a
roof
for
tonight
at
any
rate'

'oh
that
was
poetry'
said
pippin
'do
you
really
mean
to
start
before
the
break
of
day'

'i
don't
know'
answered
frodo
'i
fear
those
black
riders
and
I
am
sure
it
is
unsafe
to
stay
in
one
place
long
especially
in
a
place
to
which
it
is
known
I
was
going
also
gildor
advised
me
not
to
wait
but
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
gandalf
I
could
see
that
even
gildor
was
disturbed
when
he
heard
that
gandalf
had
never
appeared
it
really
depends
on
two
things
how
soon
could
the
riders
get
to
bucklebury
and
how
soon
could
we
get
off
it
will
take
a
good
deal
of
preparation'

'the
answer
to
the
second
question'
said
merry
'is
that
we
could
get
off
in
an
hour
I
have
prepared
practically
everything
there
are
six
ponies
in
a
stable
across
the
fields
stores
and
tackle
are
all
packed
except
for
a
few
extra
clothes
and
the
perishable
food'

'it
seems
to
have
been
a
very
efficient
conspiracy'
said
frodo
'but
what
about
the
black
riders
would
it
be
safe
to
wait
one
day
for
gandalf'

'that
all
depends
on
what
you
think
the
riders
would
do
if
they
found
you
here'
answered
merry
'they

could

have
reached
here
by
now
of
course
if
they
were
not
stopped
at
the
northgate
where
the
hedge
runs
down
to
the
riverbank
just
this
side
of
the
bridge
the
gateguards
would
not
let
them
through
by
night
though
they
might
break
through
even
in
the
daylight
they
would
try
to
keep
them
out
I
think
at
any
rate
until
they
got
a
message
through
to
the
master
of
the
hall

for
they
would
not
like
the
look
of
the
riders
and
would
certainly
be
frightened
by
them
but
of
course
buckland
cannot
resist
a
determined
attack
for
long
and
it
is
possible
that
in
the
morning
even
a
black
rider
that
rode
up
and
asked
for
mr
baggins
would
be
let
through
it
is
pretty
generally
known
that
you
are
coming
back
to
live
at
crickhollow'

frodo
sat
for
a
while
in
thought
'i
have
made
up
my
mind'
he
said
finally
'i
am
starting
tomorrow
as
soon
as
it
is
light
but
I
am
not
going
by
road
it
would
be
safer
to
wait
here
than
that
if
I
go
through
the
northgate
my
departure
from
buckland
will
be
known
at
once
instead
of
being
secret
for
several
days
at
least
as
it
might
be
and
what
is
more
the
bridge
and
the
east
road
near
the
borders
will
certainly
be
watched
whether
any
rider
gets
into
buckland
or
not
we
don't
know
how
many
there
are
but
there
are
at
least
two
and
possibly
more
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
off
in
a
quite
unexpected
direction'

'but
that
can
only
mean
going
into
the
old
forest'
said
fredegar
horrified
'you
can't
be
thinking
of
doing
that
it
is
quite
as
dangerous
as
black
riders'

'not
quite'
said
merry
it
sounds
very
desperate
but
I
believe
frodo
is
right
it
is
the
only
way
of
getting
off
without
being
followed
at
once
with
luck
we
might
gel
a
considerable
start'

'but
you
won't
have
any
luck
in
the
old
forest'
objected
fredegar
'no
one
ever
has
luck
in
there
you'll
gel
lost
people
don't
go
in
there'

'oh
yes
they
do'
said
merry
'the
brandybucks
go
in

occasionally
when
the
fit
takes
them
we
have
a
private
entrance
frodo
went
in
once
long
ago
I
have
been
in
several
times
usually
in
daylight
of
course
when
the
trees
are
sleepy
and
fairly
quiet'

'well
do
as
you
think
best'
said
fredegar
'i
am
more
afraid
of
the
old
forest
than
of
anything
I
know
about
the
stories
about
it
are
a
nightmare
but
my
vote
hardly
counts
as
I
am
not
going
on
the
journey
still
I
am
very
glad
someone
is
stopping
behind
who
can
tell
gandalf
what
you
have
done
when
he
turns
up
as
I
am
sure
he
will
before
long'

fond
as
he
was
of
frodo
fatty
bolger
had
no
desire
to
leave
the
shire
nor
to
see
what
lay
outside
it
his
family
came
from
the
eastfarthing
from
budgeford
in
bridgefields
in
fact
but
he
had
never
been
over
the
brandywine
bridge
his
task
according
to
the
original
plans
of
the
conspirators
was
to
stay
behind
and
deal
with
inquisitive
folk
and
to
keep
up
as
long
as
possible
the
pretence
that
mr
baggins
was
still
living
at
crickhollow
he
had
even
brought
along
some
old
clothes
of
frodo's
to
help
him
in
playing
the
part
they
little
thought
how
dangerous
that
part
might
prove


'excellent'
said
frodo
when
he
understood
the
plan
'we
could
not
have
left
any
message
behind
for
gandalf
otherwise
I
don't
know
whether
these
riders
can
read
or
not
of
course
but
I
should
not
have
dared
to
risk
a
written
message
in
case
they
got
in
and
searched
the
house
but
if
fatty
is
willing
to
hold
the
fort
and
I
can
be
sure
of
gandalf
knowing
the
way
we
have
gone
that
decides
me
I
am
going
into
the
old
forest
first
thing
tomorrow'

'well
that's
that'
said
pippin
'on
the
whole
I
would
rather
have
our
job
than
fatty's

waiting
here
till
black
riders
come'

'you
wait
till
you
are
well
inside
the
forest'
said
fredegar
'you'll
wish
you
were
back
here
with
me
before
this
time
tomorrow'

'it's
no
good
arguing
about
it
any
more'
said
merry
'we
have
still
got
to
tidy
up
and
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
packing
before
we
get
to
bed
I
shall
call
you
all
before
the
break
of
day'

when
at
last
he
had
got
to
bed
frodo
could
not
sleep
for
some
time
his
legs
ached
he
was
glad
that
he
was
riding
in
the
morning
eventually
he
fell
into
a
vague
dream
in
which
he
seemed
to
be
looking
out
of
a
high
window
over
a
dark
sea
of
tangled
trees
down
below
among
the
roots
there
was
the
sound
of
creatures
crawling
and
snuffling
he
felt
sure
they
would
smell
him
out
sooner
or
later

then
he
heard
a
noise
in
the
distance
at
first
he
thought
it
was
a
great
wind
coming
over
the
leaves
of
the
forest
then
he
knew
that
it
was
not
leaves
but
the
sound
of
the
sea
faroff
a
sound
he
had
never
heard
in
waking
life
though
it
had
often
troubled
his
dreams
suddenly
he
found
he
was
out
in
the
open
there
were
no
trees
after
all
he
was
on
a
dark
heath
and
there
was
a
strange
salt
smell
in
the
air
looking
up
he
saw
before
him
a
tall
white
tower
standing
alone
on
a
high
ridge
a
great
desire
came
over
him
to
climb
the
tower
and
see
the
sea
he
started
to
struggle
up
the
ridge
towards
the
tower
but
suddenly
a
light
came
in
the
sky
and
there
was
a
noise
of
thunder


chapter
6


the
old
forest


frodo
woke
suddenly
it
was
still
dark
in
the
room
merry
was
standing
there
with
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
banging
on
the
door
with
the
other
'all
right
what
is
it'
said
frodo
still
shaken
and
bewildered

'what
is
it'
cried
merry
'it
is
time
to
get
up
it
is
half
past
four
and
very
foggy
come
on
sam
is
already
getting
breakfast
ready
even
pippin
is
up
I
am
just
going
to
saddle
the
ponies
and
fetch
the
one
that
is
to
be
the
baggagecarrier
wake
that
sluggard
fatty
at
least
he
must
get
up
and
see
us
off'

soon
after
six
o'clock
the
five
hobbits
were
ready
to
start
fatty
bolger
was
still
yawning
they
stole
quietly
out
of
the
house
merry
went
in
front
leading
a
laden
pony
and
took
his
way
along
a
path
that
went
through
a
spinney
behind
the
house
and
then
cut
across
several
fields
the
leaves
of
trees
were
glistening
and
every
twig
was
dripping
the
grass
was
grey
with
cold
dew
everything
was
still
and
faraway
noises
seemed
near
and
clear
fowls
chattering
in
a
yard
someone
closing
a
door
of
a
distant
house

in
their
shed
they
found
the
ponies
sturdy
little
beasts
of
the
kind
loved
by
hobbits
not
speedy
but
good
for
a
long
day's
work
they
mounted
and
soon
they
were
riding
off
into
the
mist
which
seemed
to
open
reluctantly
before
them
and
close
forbiddingly
behind
them
after
riding
for
about
an
hour
slowly
and
without
talking
they
saw
the
hedge
looming
suddenly
ahead
it
was
tall
and
netted
over
with
silver
cobwebs
'how
are
you
going
to
get
through
this'
asked
fredegar
'follow
me'
said
merry
'and
you
will
see'
he
turned
to
the
left
along
the
hedge
and
soon
they
came
to
a
point
where
it
bent
inwards
running
along
the
lip
of
a
hollow
a
cutting
had
been
made
at
some
distance
from
the
hedge
and
went
sloping
gently
down
into
the
ground
it
had
walls
of
brick
at
the
sides
which
rose
steadily
until
suddenly
they
arched
over
and
formed
a
tunnel
that
dived
deep
under
the
hedge
and
came
out
in
the
hollow
on
the
other
side

here
fatty
bolger
halted
'goodbye
frodo'
he
said
'i
wish
you
were
not
going
into
the
forest
I
only
hope
you
will
not
need
rescuing
before
the
day
is
out
but
good
luck
to
you

today
and
every
day'

'if
there
are
no
worse
things
ahead
than
the
old
forest
I
shall
be
lucky'
said
frodo
'tell
gandalf
to
hurry
along
the
east
road
we
shall
soon
be
back
on
it
and
going
as
fast
as
we
can'
'goodbye'
they
cried
and
rode
down
the
slope
and
disappeared
from
fredegar's
sight
into
the
tunnel

it
was
dark
and
damp
at
the
far
end
it
was
closed
by
a
gate
of
thickset
iron
bars
merry
got
down
and
unlocked
the
gate
and
when
they
had
all
passed
through
he
pushed
it
to
again
it
shut
with
a
clang
and
the
lock
clicked
the
sound
was
ominous

'there'
said
merry
'you
have
left
the
shire
and
are
now
outside
and
on
the
edge
of
the
old
forest'

'are
the
stories
about
it
true'
asked
pippin

'i
don't
know
what
stories
you
mean'
merry
answered
'if
you
mean
the
old
bogeystories
fatty's
nurses
used
to
tell
him
about
goblins
and
wolves
and
things
of
that
sort
I
should
say
no
at
any
rate
I
don't
believe
them
but
the
forest

is

queer
everything
in
it
is
very
much
more
alive
more
aware
of
what
is
going
on
so
to
speak
than
things
are
in
the
shire
and
the
trees
do
not
like
strangers
they
watch
you
they
are
usually
content
merely
to
watch
you
as
long
as
daylight
lasts
and
don't
do
much
occasionally
the
most
unfriendly
ones
may
drop
a
branch
or
stick
a
root
out
or
grasp
at
you
with
a
long
trailer
but
at
night
things
can
be
most
alarming
or
so
I
am
told
I
have
only
once
or
twice
been
in
here
after
dark
and
then
only
near
the
hedge
I
thought
all
the
trees
were
whispering
to
each
other
passing
news
and
plots
along
in
an
unintelligible
language
and
the
branches
swayed
and
groped
without
any
wind
they
do
say
the
trees
do
actually
move
and
can
surround
strangers
and
hem
them
in
in
fact
long
ago
they
attacked
the
hedge
they
came
and
planted
themselves
right
by
it
and
leaned
over
it
but
the
hobbits
came
and
cut
down
hundreds
of
trees
and
made
a
great
bonfire
in
the
forest
and
burned
all
the
ground
in
a
long
strip
east
of
the
hedge
after
that
the
trees
gave
up
the
attack
but
they
became
very
unfriendly
there
is
still
a
wide
bare
space
not
far
inside
where
the
bonfire
was
made'

'is
it
only
the
trees
that
are
dangerous'
asked
pippin

'there
are
various
queer
things
living
deep
in
the
forest
and
on
the
far
side'
said
merry
'or
at
least
I
have
heard
so
but
I
have
never
seen
any
of
them
but
something
makes
paths
whenever
one
comes
inside
one
finds
open
tracks
but
they
seem
to
shift
and
change
from
time
to
time
in
a
queer
fashion
not
far
from
this
tunnel
there
is
or
was
for
a
long
time
the
beginning
of
quite
a
broad
path
leading
to
the
bonfire
glade
and
then
on
more
or
less
in
our
direction
east
and
a
little
north
that
is
the
path
I
am
going
to
try
and
find'

the
hobbits
now
left
the
tunnelgate
and
rode
across
the
wide
hollow
on
the
far
side
was
a
faint
path
leading
up
on
to
the
floor
of
the
forest
a
hundred
yards
and
more
beyond
the
hedge
but
it
vanished
as
soon
as
it
brought
them
under
the
trees
looking
back
they
could
see
the
dark
line
of
the
hedge
through
the
stems
of
trees
that
were
already
thick
about
them
looking
ahead
they
could
see
only
treetrunks
of
innumerable
sizes
and
shapes
straight
or
bent
twisted
leaning
squat
or
slender
smooth
or
gnarled
and
branched
and
all
the
stems
were
green
or
grey
with
moss
and
slimy
shaggy
growths

merry
alone
seemed
fairly
cheerful
'you
had
better
lead
on
and
find
that
path'
frodo
said
to
him
'don't
let
us
lose
one
another
or
forget
which
way
the
hedge
lies'

they
picked
a
way
among
the
trees
and
their
ponies
plodded
along
carefully
avoiding
the
many
writhing
and
interlacing
roots
there
was
no
undergrowth
the
ground
was
rising
steadily
and
as
they
went
forward
it
seemed
that
the
trees
became
taller
darker
and
thicker
there
was
no
sound
except
an
occasional
drip
of
moisture
falling
through
the
still
leaves
for
the
moment
there
was
no
whispering
or
movement
among
the
branches
but
they
all
got
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
they
were
being
watched
with
disapproval
deepening
to
dislike
and
even
enmity
the
feeling
steadily
grew
until
they
found
themselves
looking
up
quickly
or
glancing
back
over
their
shoulders
as
if
they
expected
a
sudden
blow

there
was
not
as
yet
any
sign
of
a
path
and
the
trees
seemed
constantly
to
bar
their
way
pippin
suddenly
felt
that
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
without
warning
let
out
a
shout
'oi
oi'
he
cried
'i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
just
let
me
pass
through
will
you'

the
others
halted
startled
but
the
cry
fell
as
if
muffled
by
a
heavy
curtain
there
was
no
echo
or
answer
though
the
wood
seemed
to
become
more
crowded
and
more
watchful
than
before

'i
should
not
shout
if
I
were
you'
said
merry
it
does
more
harm
than
good'

frodo
began
to
wonder
if
it
were
possible
to
find
a
way
through
and
if
he
had
been
right
to
make
the
others
come
into
this
abominable
wood
merry
was
looking
from
side
to
side
and
seemed
already
uncertain
which
way
to
go
pippin
noticed
it
'it
has
not
taken
you
long
to
lose
us'
he
said
but
at
that
moment
merry
gave
a
whistle
of
relief
and
pointed
ahead

'well
well'
he
said
'these
trees

do

shift
there
is
the
bonfire
glade
in
front
of
us
or
I
hope
so
but
the
path
to
it
seems
to
have
moved
away'

the
light
grew
clearer
as
they
went
forward
suddenly
they
came
out
of
the
trees
and
found
themselves
in
a
wide
circular
space
there
was
sky
above
them
blue
and
clear
to
their
surprise
for
down
under
the
forestroof
they
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
rising
morning
and
the
lifting
of
the
mist
the
sun
was
not
however
high
enough
yet
to
shine
down
into
the
clearing
though
its
light
was
on
the
treetops
the
leaves
were
all
thicker
and
greener
about
the
edges
of
the
glade
enclosing
it
with
an
almost
solid
wall
no
tree
grew
there
only
rough
grass
and
many
tall
plants
stalky
and
faded
hemlocks
and
woodparsley
fireweed
seeding
into
fluffy
ashes
and
rampant
nettles
and
thistles
a
dreary
place
but
it
seemed
a
charming
and
cheerful
garden
after
the
close
forest

the
hobbits
felt
encouraged
and
looked
up
hopefully
at
the
broadening
daylight
in
the
sky
at
the
far
side
of
the
glade
there
was
a
break
in
the
wall
of
trees
and
a
clear
path
beyond
it
they
could
see
it
running
on
into
the
wood
wide
in
places
and
open
above
though
every
now
and
again
the
trees
drew
in
and
overshadowed
it
with
their
dark
boughs
up
this
path
they
rode
they
were
still
climbing
gently
but
they
now
went
much
quicker
and
with
better
heart
for
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
forest
had
relented
and
was
going
to
let
them
pass
unhindered
after
all

but
after
a
while
the
air
began
to
get
hot
and
stuffy
the
trees
drew
close
again
on
either
side
and
they
could
no
longer
see
far
ahead
now
stronger
than
ever
they
felt
again
the
ill
will
of
the
wood
pressing
on
them
so
silent
was
it
that
the
fall
of
their
ponies'
hoofs
rustling
on
dead
leaves
and
occasionally
stumbling
on
hidden
roots
seemed
to
thud
in
their
ears
frodo
tried
to
sing
a
song
to
encourage
them
but
his
voice
sank
to
a
murmur

o
wanderers
in
the
shadowed
land

despair
not
for
though
dark
they
stand

all
woods
there
be
must
end
at
last

and
see
the
open
sun
go
past

the
setting
sun
the
rising
sun

the
day's
end
or
the
day
begun

for
east
or
west
all
woods
must
fail




fail


even
as
he
said
the
word
his
voice
faded
into
silence
the
air
seemed
heavy
and
the
making
of
words
wearisome
just
behind
them
a
large
branch
fell
from
an
old
overhanging
tree
with
a
crash
into
the
path
the
trees
seemed
to
close
in
before
them


'they
do
not
like
all
that
about
ending
and
failing'
said
merry
'i
should
not
sing
any
more
at
present
wait
till
we
do
get
to
the
edge
and
then
we'll
turn
and
give
them
a
rousing
chorus'

he
spoke
cheerfully
and
if
he
felt
any
great
anxiety
he
did
not
show
it
the
others
did
not
answer
they
were
depressed
a
heavy
weight
was
settling
steadily
on
frodo's
heart
and
he
regretted
now
with
every
step
forward
that
he
had
ever
thought
of
challenging
the
menace
of
the
trees
he
was
indeed
just
about
to
stop
and
propose
going
back
if
that
was
still
possible
when
things
took
a
new
turn
the
path
stopped
climbing
and
became
for
a
while
nearly
level
the
dark
trees
drew
aside
and
ahead
they
could
see
the
path
going
almost
straight
forward
before
them
but
some
distance
off
there
stood
a
green
hilltop
treeless
rising
like
a
bald
head
out
of
the
encircling
wood
the
path
seemed
to
be
making
directly
for
it

they
now
hurried
forward
again
delighted
with
the
thought
of
climbing
out
for
a
while
above
the
roof
of
the
forest
the
path
dipped
and
then
again
began
to
climb
upwards
leading
them
at
last
to
the
foot
of
the
steep
hillside
there
it
left
the
trees
and
faded
into
the
turf
the
wood
stood
all
round
the
hill
like
thick
hair
that
ended
sharply
in
a
circle
round
a
shaven
crown

the
hobbits
led
their
ponies
up
winding
round
and
round
until
they
reached
the
top
there
they
stood
and
gazed
about
them
the
air
was
gleaming
and
sunlit
but
hazy
and
they
could
not
see
to
any
great
distance
near
at
hand
the
mist
was
now
almost
gone
though
here
and
there
it
lay
in
hollows
of
the
wood
and
to
the
south
of
them
out
of
a
deep
fold
cutting
right
across
the
forest
the
fog
still
rose
like
steam
or
wisps
of
white
smoke

'that'
said
merry
pointing
with
his
hand
'that
is
the
line
of
the
withywindle
it
comes
down
out
of
the
downs
and
flows
southwest
through
the
midst
of
the
forest
to
join
the
brandywine
below
haysend
we
don't
want
to
go

that

way
the
withywindle
valley
is
said
to
be
the
queerest
part
of
the
whole
wood

the
centre
from
which
all
the
queerness
comes
as
it
were'

the
others
looked
in
the
direction
that
merry
pointed
out
but
they
could
see
little
but
mists
over
the
damp
and
deepcut
valley
and
beyond
it
the
southern
half
of
the
forest
faded
from
view

the
sun
on
the
hilllop
was
now
getting
hot
it
must
have
been
about
eleven
o'clock
but
the
autumn
haze
still
prevented
them
from
seeing
much
in
other
directions
in
the
west
they
could
not
make
out
either
the
line
of
the
hedge
or
the
valley
of
the
brandywine
beyond
it
northward
where
they
looked
most
hopefully
they
could
see
nothing
that
might
be
the
line
of
the
great
east
road
for
which
they
were
making
they
were
on
an
island
in
a
sea
of
trees
and
the
horizon
was
veiled

on
the
southeastern
side
the
ground
fell
very
steeply
as
if
the
slopes
of
the
hill
were
continued
far
down
under
the
trees
like
islandshores
that
really
are
the
sides
of
a
mountain
rising
out
of
deep
waters
they
sat
on
the
green
edge
and
looked
out
over
the
woods
below
them
while
they
ate
their
midday
meal
as
the
sun
rose
and
passed
noon
they
glimpsed
far
off
in
the
east
the
greygreen
lines
of
the
downs
that
lay
beyond
the
old
forest
on
that
side
that
cheered
them
greatly
for
it
was
good
to
see
a
sight
of
anything
beyond
the
wood's
borders
though
they
did
not
mean
to
go
that
way
if
they
could
help
it
the
barrowdowns
had
as
sinister
a
reputation
in
hobbitlegend
as
the
forest
itself

at
length
they
made
up
their
minds
to
go
on
again
the
path
that
had
brought
them
to
the
hill
reappeared
on
the
northward
side
but
they
had
not
followed
it
far
before
they
became
aware
that
it
was
bending
steadily
to
the
right
soon
it
began
to
descend
rapidly
and
they
guessed
that
it
must
actually
be
heading
towards
the
withywindle
valley
not
at
all
the
direction
they
wished
lo
take
after
some
discussion
they
decided
to
leave
this
misleading
path
and
strike
northward
for
although
they
had
not
been
able
to
see
it
from
the
hilltop
the
road
must
lie
that
way
and
it
could
not
be
many
miles
off
also
northward
and
to
the
left
of
the
path
the
land
seemed
lo
be
drier
and
more
open
climbing
up
to
slopes
where
the
trees
were
thinner
and
pines
and
firs
replaced
the
oaks
and
ashes
and
other
strange
and
nameless
trees
of
the
denser
wood

at
first
their
choice
seemed
to
be
good
they
got
along
at
a
fair
speed
though
whenever
they
got
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
in
an
open
glade
they
seemed
unaccountably
to
have
veered
eastwards
but
after
a
time
the
trees
began
to
close
in
again
just
where
they
had
appeared
from
a
distance
to
be
thinner
and
less
tangled
then
deep
folds
in
the
ground
were
discovered
unexpectedly
like
the
ruts
of
great
giantwheels
or
wide
moats
and
sunken
roads
long
disused
and
choked
with
brambles
these
lay
usually
right
across
their
line
of
march
and
could
only
be
crossed
by
scrambling
down
and
out
again
which
was
troublesome
and
difficult
with
their
ponies
each
time
they
climbed
down
they
found
the
hollow
filled
with
thick
bushes
and
matted
undergrowth
which
somehow
would
not
yield
to
the
left
but
only
gave
way
when
they
turned
to
the
right
and
they
had
to
go
some
distance
along
the
bottom
before
they
could
find
a
way
up
the
further
bank
each
time
they
clambered
out
the
trees
seemed
deeper
and
darker
and
always
to
the
left
and
upwards
it
was
most
difficult
to
find
a
way
and
they
were
forced
to
the
right
and
downwards

after
an
hour
or
two
they
had
lost
all
clear
sense
of
direction
though
they
knew
well
enough
that
they
had
long
ceased
to
go
northward
at
all
they
were
being
headed
off
and
were
simply
following
a
course
chosen
for
them

eastwards
and
southwards
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
and
not
out
of
it

the
afternoon
was
wearing
away
when
they
scrambled
and
stumbled
into
a
fold
that
was
wider
and
deeper
than
any
they
had
yet
met
it
was
so
sleep
and
overhung
that
it
proved
impossible
to
climb
out
of
it
again
either
forwards
or
backwards
without
leaving
their
ponies
and
their
baggage
behind
all
they
could
do
was
to
follow
the
fold

downwards
the
ground
grew
soft
and
in
places
boggy
springs
appeared
in
the
banks
and
soon
they
found
themselves
following
a
brook
that
trickled
and
babbled
through
a
weedy
bed
then
the
ground
began
to
fall
rapidly
and
the
brook
growing
strong
and
noisy
flowed
and
leaped
swiftly
downhill
they
were
in
a
deep
dimlit
gully
overarched
by
trees
high
above
them

after
stumbling
along
for
some
way
along
the
stream
they
came
quite
suddenly
out
of
the
gloom
as
if
through
a
gate
they
saw
the
sunlight
before
them
coming
to
the
opening
they
found
that
they
had
made
their
way
down
through
a
cleft
in
a
high
sleep
bank
almost
a
cliff
at
its
feet
was
a
wide
space
of
grass
and
reeds
and
in
the
distance
could
be
glimpsed
another
bank
almost
as
steep
a
golden
afternoon
of
late
sunshine
lay
warm
and
drowsy
upon
the
hidden
land
between
in
the
midst
of
it
there
wound
lazily
a
dark
river
of
brown
water
bordered
with
ancient
willows
arched
over
with
willows
blocked
with
fallen
willows
and
flecked
with
thousands
of
faded
willowleaves
the
air
was
thick
with
them
fluttering
yellow
from
the
branches
for
there
was
a
warm
and
gentle
breeze
blowing
softly
in
the
valley
and
the
reeds
were
rustling
and
the
willowboughs
were
creaking

'well
now
I
have
at
least
some
notion
of
where
we
are'
said
merry
'we
have
come
almost
in
the
opposite
direction
to
which
we
intended
this
is
the
river
withywindle
I
will
go
on
and
explore'

he
passed
out
into
the
sunshine
and
disappeared
into
the
long
grasses
after
a
while
he
reappeared
and
reported
that
there
was
fairly
solid
ground
between
the
clifffoot
and
the
river
in
some
places
firm
turf
went
down
to
the
water's
edge
'what's
more'
he
said
'there
seems
to
be
something
like
a
footpath
winding
along
on
this
side
of
the
river
if
we
turn
left
and
follow
it
we
shall
be
bound
to
come
out
on
the
east
side
of
the
forest
eventually'

'i
dare
say'
said
pippin
'that
is
if
the
track
goes
on
so
far
and
does
not
simply
lead
us
into
a
bog
and
leave
us
there
who
made
the
track
do
you
suppose
and
why
I
am
sure
it
was
not
for
our
benefit
I
am
getting
very
suspicious
of
this
forest
and
everything
in
it
and
I
begin
to
believe
all
the
stories
about
it
and
have
you
any
idea
how
far
eastward
we
should
have
to
go'

'no'
said
merry
'i
haven't
I
don't
know
in
the
least
how
far
down
the
withywindle
we
are
or
who
could
possibly
come
here
often
enough
to
make
a
path
along
it
but
there
is
no
other
way
out
that
I
can
see
or
think
of'

there
being
nothing
else
for
it
they
filed
out
and
merry
led
them
to
the
path
that
he
had
discovered
everywhere
the
reeds
and
grasses
were
lush
and
tall
in
places
far
above
their
heads
but
once
found
the
path
was
easy
to
follow
as
it
turned
and
twisted
picking
out
the
sounder
ground
among
the
bogs
and
pools
here
and
there
it
passed
over
other
rills
running
down
gullies
into
the
withywindle
out
of
the
higher
forestlands
and
at
these
points
there
were
treetrunks
or
bundles
of
brushwood
laid
carefully
across

the
hobbits
began
to
feel
very
hot
there
were
armies
of
flies
of
all
kinds
buzzing
round
their
ears
and
the
afternoon
sun
was
burning
on
their
backs
at
last
they
came
suddenly
into
a
thin
shade
great
grey
branches
reached
across
the
path
each
step
forward
became
more
reluctant
than
the
last
sleepiness
seemed
to
be
creeping
out
of
the
ground
and
up
their
legs
and
falling
softly
out
of
the
air
upon
their
heads
and
eyes

frodo
felt
his
chin
go
down
and
his
head
nod
just
in
front
of
him
pippin
fell
forward
on
to
his
knees
frodo
halted
'it's
no
good'
he
heard
merry
saying
'can't
go
another
step
without
rest
must
have
nap
it's
cool
under
the
willows
less
flies'

frodo
did
not
like
the
sound
of
this
'come
on'
he
cried
'we
can't
have
a
nap
yet
we
must
get
clear
of
the
forest
first'
but
the
others
were
too
far
gone
to
care
beside
them
sam
stood
yawning
and
blinking
stupidly

suddenly
frodo
himself
felt
sleep
overwhelming
him
his
head
swam
there
now
seemed
hardly
a
sound
in
the
air
the
flies
had
stopped
buzzing
only
a
gentle
noise
on
the
edge
of
hearing
a
soft
fluttering
as
of
a
song
half
whispered
seemed
to
stir
in
the
boughs
above
he
lifted
his
heavy
eyes
and
saw
leaning
over
him
a
huge
willowtree
old
and
hoary
enormous
it
looked
its
sprawling
branches
going
up
like
reaching
arms
with
many
longfingered
hands
its
knotted
and
twisted
trunk
gaping
in
wide
fissures
that
creaked
faintly
as
the
boughs
moved
the
leaves
fluttering
against
the
bright
sky
dazzled
him
and
he
toppled
over
lying
where
he
fell
upon
the
grass

merry
and
pippin
dragged
themselves
forward
and
lay
down
with
their
backs
to
the
willowtrunk
behind
them
the
great
cracks
gaped
wide
to
receive
them
as
the
tree
swayed
and
creaked
they
looked
up
at
the
grey
and
yellow
leaves
moving
softly
against
the
light
and
singing
they
shut
their
eyes
and
then
it
seemed
that
they
could
almost
hear
words
cool
words
saying
something
about
water
and
sleep
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
spell
and
fell
fast
asleep
at
the
foot
of
the
great
grey
willow

frodo
lay
for
a
while
fighting
with
the
sleep
that
was
overpowering
him
then
with
an
effort
he
struggled
to
his
feel
again
he
felt
a
compelling
desire
for
cool
water
'wait
for
me
sam'
he
stammered
'must
bathe
feet
a
minute'

half
in
a
dream
he
wandered
forward
to
the
riverward
side
of
the
tree
where
great
winding
roots
grew
out
into
the
stream
like
gnarled
dragonets
straining
down
to
drink
he
straddled
one
of
these
and
paddled
his
hot
feel
in
the
cool
brown
water
and
there
he
too
suddenly
fell
asleep
with
his
back
against
the
tree

sam
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
and
yawned
like
a
cavern
he
was
worried
the
afternoon
was
getting
late
and
he
thought
this
sudden
sleepiness
uncanny
'there's
more
behind
this
than
sun
and
warm
air'
he
muttered
to
himself
'i
don't
like
this
great
big
tree
I
don't
trust
it
hark
at
it
singing
about
sleep
now
this
won't
do
at
all'

he
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
staggered
off
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
ponies
he
found
that
two
had
wandered
on
a
good
way
along
the
path
and
he
had
just
caught
them
and
brought
them
back
towards
the
others
when
he
heard
two
noises
one
loud
and
the
other
soft
but
very
clear
one
was
the
splash
of
something
heavy
falling
into
the
water
the
other
was
a
noise
like
the
snick
of
a
lock
when
a
door
quietly
closes
fast

he
rushed
back
to
the
bank
frodo
was
in
the
water
close
to
the
edge
and
a
great
treeroot
seemed
to
be
over
him
and
holding
him
down
but
he
was
not
struggling
sam
gripped
him
by
the
jacket
and
dragged
him
from
under
the
root
and
then
with
difficulty
hauled
him
on
to
the
bank
almost
at
once
he
woke
and
coughed
and
spluttered

'do
you
know
sam'
he
said
at
length
'the
beastly
tree

threw

me
in
I
felt
it
the
big
root
just
twisted
round
and
tipped
me
in'


'you
were
dreaming
I
expect
mr
frodo'
said
sam
'you
shouldn't
sit
in
such
a
place
if
you
feel
sleepy'

'what
about
the
others'
frodo
asked
'i
wonder
what
sort
of
dreams
they
are
having'

they
went
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
tree
and
then
sam
understood
the
click
that
he
had
heard
pippin
had
vanished
the
crack
by
which
he
had
laid
himself
had
closed
together
so
that
not
a
chink
could
be
seen
merry
was
trapped
another
crack
had
closed
about
his
waist
his
legs
lay
outside
but
the
rest
of
him
was
inside
a
dark
opening
the
edges
of
which
gripped
like
a
pair
of
pincers

frodo
and
sam
beat
first
upon
the
treetrunk
where
pippin
had
lain
they
then
struggled
frantically
to
pull
open
the
jaws
of
the
crack
that
held
poor
merry
it
was
quite
useless

'what
a
foul
thing
to
happen'
cried
frodo
wildly
'why
did
we
ever
come
into
this
dreadful
forest
I
wish
we
were
all
back
at
crickhollow'
he
kicked
the
tree
with
all
his
strength
heedless
of
his
own
feet
a
hardly
perceptible
shiver
ran
through
the
stem
and
up
into
the
branches
the
leaves
rustled
and
whispered
but
with
a
sound
now
of
faint
and
faroff
laughter

'i
suppose
we
haven't
got
an
axe
among
our
luggage
mr
frodo'
asked
sam

'i
brought
a
little
hatchet
for
chopping
firewood'
said
frodo
'that
wouldn't
be
much
use'

'wait
a
minute'
cried
sam
struck
by
an
idea
suggested
by
firewood
'we
might
do
something
with
fire'

'we
might'
said
frodo
doubtfully
'we
might
succeed
in
roasting
pippin
alive
inside'

'we
might
try
to
hurt
or
frighten
this
tree
to
begin
with'
said
sam
fiercely
'if
it
don't
let
them
go
i'll
have
it
down
if
I
have
to
gnaw
it'
he
ran
to
the
ponies
and
before
long
came
back
with
two
tinderboxes
and
a
hatchet

quickly
they
gathered
dry
grass
and
leaves
and
bits
of
bark
and
made
a
pile
of
broken
twigs
and
chopped
sticks
these
they
heaped
against
the
trunk
on
the
far
side
of
the
tree
from
the
prisoners
as
soon
as
sam
had
struck
a
spark
into
the
tinder
it
kindled
the
dry
grass
and
a
flurry
of
flame
and
smoke
went
up
the
twigs
crackled
little
fingers
of
fire
licked
against
the
dry
scored
rind
of
the
ancient
tree
and
scorched
it
a
tremor
ran
through
the
whole
willow
the
leaves
seemed
to
hiss
above
their
heads
with
a
sound
of
pain
and
anger
a
loud
scream
came
from
merry
and
from
far
inside
the
tree
they
heard
pippin
give
a
muffled
yell

'put
it
out
put
it
out'
cried
merry
'he'll
squeeze
me
in
two
if
you
don't
he
says
so'

'who
what'
shouted
frodo
rushing
round
to
the
other
side
of
the
tree

'put
it
out
put
it
out'
begged
merry
the
branches
of
the
willow
began
to
sway
violently
there
was
a
sound
as
of
a
wind
rising
and
spreading
outwards
to
the
branches
of
all
the
other
trees
round
about
as
though
they
had
dropped
a
stone
into
the
quiet
slumber
of
the
rivervalley
and
set
up
ripples
of
anger
that
ran
out
over
the
whole
forest
sam
kicked
at
the
little
fire
and
stamped
out
the
sparks
but
frodo
without
any
clear
idea
of
why
he
did
so
or
what
he
hoped
for
ran
along
the
path
crying

help
help
help
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hardly
hear
the
sound
of
his
own
shrill
voice
it
was
blown
away
from
him
by
the
willowwind
and
drowned
in
a
clamour
of
leaves
as
soon
as
the
words
left
his
mouth
he
felt
desperate
lost
and
witless

suddenly
he
slopped
there
was
an
answer
or
so
he
thought
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
behind
him
away
down
the
path
further
back
in
the
forest
he
turned
round
and
listened
and
soon
there
could
be
no
doubt
someone
was
singing
a
song
a
deep
glad
voice
was
singing
carelessly
and
happily
but
it
was
singing
nonsense

hey
dol
merry
dol
ring
a
dong
dillo

ring
a
dong
hop
along
fal
lal
the
willow

tom
bom
jolly
tom
tom
bombadillo


half
hopeful
and
half
afraid
of
some
new
danger
frodo
and
sam
now
both
stood
still
suddenly
out
of
a
long
string
of
nonsensewords
or
so
they
seemed
the
voice
rose
up
loud
and
clear
and
burst
into
this
song

hey
come
merry
dot
derry
dol
my
darling

light
goes
the
weatherwind
and
the
feathered
starling

down
along
under
hill
shining
in
the
sunlight

waiting
on
the
doorstep
for
the
cold
starlight

there
my
pretty
lady
is
riverwoman's
daughter

slender
as
the
willowwand
clearer
than

water

old

tom's

waterlilies

hey
come

can
you
hear

singing


frodo
and
sam
stood
as
if
enchanted
the
wind
puffed
out
the
leaves
hung
silently
again
on
stiff
branches
there
was
another
burst
of
song
and
then
suddenly
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
there
appeared
above
the
reeds
an
old
battered
hat
with
a
tall
crown
and
a
long
blue
feather
stuck
in
the
band
with
another
hop
and
a
bound
there
came
into
view
a
man
or
so
it
seemed
at
any
rate
he
was
too
large
and
heavy
for
a
hobbit
if
not
quite
tall
enough
for
one
of
the
big
people
though
he
made
noise
enough
for
one
slumping
along
with
great
yellow
boots
on
his
thick
legs
and
charging
through
grass
and
rushes
like
a
cow
going
down
to
drink
he
had
a
blue
coat
and
a
long
brown
beard
his
eyes
were
blue
and
bright
and
his
face
was
red
as
a
ripe
apple
but
creased
into
a
hundred
wrinkles
of
laughter
in
his
hands
he
carried
on
a
large
leaf
as
on
a
tray
a
small
pile
of
white
waterlilies

'help'
cried
frodo
and
sam
running
towards
him
with
their
hands
stretched
out

'whoa
whoa
steady
there'
cried
the
old
man
holding
up
one
hand
and
they
stopped
short
as
if
they
had
been
struck
stiff
'now
my
little
fellows
where
be
you
agoing
to
puffing
like
a
bellows
what's
the
matter
here
then
do
you
know
who
I
am
i'm
tom
bombadil
tell
me
what's
your
trouble
tom's
in
a
hurry
now
don't
you
crush
my
lilies'

'my
friends
are
caught
in
the
willowtree'
cried
frodo
breathlessly

'master
merry's
being
squeezed
in
a
crack'
cried
sam

'what'
shouted
tom
bombadil
leaping
up
in
the
air
'old
man
willow
naught
worse
than
that
eh
that
can
soon
be
mended
I
know
the
tune
for
him
old
grey
willowman
i'll
freeze
his
marrow
cold
if
he
don't
behave
himself
i'll
sing
his
roots
off
i'll
sing
a
wind
up
and
blow
leaf
and
branch
away
old
man
willow'
setting
down
his
lilies
carefully
on
the
grass
he
ran
to
the
tree
there
he
saw
merry's
feet
still
sticking
out

the
rest
had
already
been
drawn
further
inside
tom
put
his
mouth
to
the
crack
and
began
singing
into
it
in
a
low
voice
they
could
not
catch
the
words
but
evidently
merry
was
aroused
his
legs
began
to
kick
tom
sprang
away
and
breaking
off
a
hanging
branch
smote
the
side
of
the
willow
with
it
'you
let
them
out
again
old
man
willow'
he
said
'what
be
you
athinking
of
you
should
not
be
waking
eat
earth
dig
deep
drink
water
go
to
sleep
bombadil
is
talking'
he
then
seized
merry's
feet
and
drew
him
out
of
the
suddenly
widening
crack


there
was
a
tearing
creak
and
the
other
crack
split
open
and
out
of
it
pippin
sprang
as
if
he
had
been
kicked
then
with
a
loud
snap
both
cracks
closed
fast
again
a
shudder
ran
through
the
tree
from
root
to
tip
and
complete
silence
fell

'thank
you'
said
the
hobbits
one
after
the
other

tom
bombadil
burst
out
laughing
'well
my
little
fellows'
said
he
stooping
so
that
he
peered
into
their
faces
'you
shall
come
home
with
me
the
table
is
all
laden
with
yellow
cream
honeycomb
and
white
bread
and
butter
goldberry
is
waiting
time
enough
for
questions
around
the
supper
table
you
follow
after
me
as
quick
as
you
are
able'
with
that
he
picked
up
his
lilies
and
then
with
a
beckoning
wave
of
his
hand
went
hopping
and
dancing
along
the
path
eastward
still
singing
loudly
and
nonsensically

too
surprised
and
too
relieved
to
talk
the
hobbits
followed
after
him
as
fast
as
they
could
but
that
was
not
fast
enough
tom
soon
disappeared
in
front
of
them
and
the
noise
of
his
singing
got
fainter
and
further
away
suddenly
his
voice
came
floating
back
to
them
in
a
loud
halloo

hop
along
my
little
friends
up
the
withywindle

tom's
going
on
ahead
candles
for
to
kindle

down
west
sinks
the
sun
soon
you
will
be
groping

when
the
nightshadows
fall
then
the
door
will
open

out
of
the
windowpanes
light
will
twinkle
yellow

fear
no

no

fear
neither

nor

tom
goes
on
before
you

hey
now
merry
dot
we'll
be
waiting
for
you


after
that
the
hobbits
heard
no
more
almost
at
once
the
sun
seemed
to
sink
into
the
trees
behind
them
they
thought
of
the
slanting
light
of
evening
glittering
on
the
brandywine
river
and
the
windows
of
bucklebury
beginning
to
gleam
with
hundreds
of
lights
great
shadows
fell
across
them
trunks
and
branches
of
trees
hung
dark
and
threatening
over
the
path
white
mists
began
to
rise
and
curl
on
the
surface
of
the
river
and
stray
about
the
roots
of
the
trees
upon
its
borders
out
of
the
very
ground
at
their
feet
a
shadowy
steam
arose
and
mingled
with
the
swiftly
falling
dusk

it
became
difficult
to
follow
the
path
and
they
were
very
tired
their
legs
seemed
leaden
strange
furtive
noises
ran
among
the
bushes
and
reeds
on
either
side
of
them
and
if
they
looked
up
to
the
pale
sky
they
caught
sight
of
queer
gnarled
and
knobbly
faces
that
gloomed
dark
against
the
twilight
and
leered
down
at
them
from
the
high
bank
and
the
edges
of
the
wood
they
began
to
feel
that
all
this
country
was
unreal
and
that
they
were
stumbling
through
an
ominous
dream
that
led
to
no
awakening

just
as
they
felt
their
feet
slowing
down
to
a
standstill
they
noticed
that
the
ground
was
gently
rising
the
water
began
to
murmur
in
the
darkness
they
caught
the
white
glimmer
of
foam
where
the
river
flowed
over
a
short
fall
then
suddenly
the
trees
came
to
an
end
and
the
mists
were
left
behind
they
stepped
out
from
the
forest
and
found
a
wide
sweep
of
grass
welling
up
before
them
the
river
now
small
and
swift
was
leaping
merrily
down
to
meet
them
glinting
here
and
there
in
the
light
of
the
stars
which
were
already
shining
in
the
sky

the
grass
under
their
feet
was
smooth
and
short
as
if
it
had
been
mown
or
shaven
the
eaves
of
the
forest
behind
were
clipped
and
trim
as
a
hedge
the
path
was
now
plain
before
them
welltended
and
bordered
with
stone
it
wound
up
on
to
the
top
of
a
grassy
knoll
now
grey
under
the
pale
starry
night
and
there
still
high
above
them
on
a
further
slope
they
saw
the
twinkling
lights
of
a
house
down
again
the
path
went
and
then
up
again
up
a
long
smooth
hillside
of
turf
towards
the
light
suddenly
a
wide
yellow
beam
flowed
out
brightly
from
a
door
that
was
opened
there
was
tom
bombadil's
house
before
them
up
down
under
hill
behind
it
a
steep
shoulder
of
the
land
lay
grey
and
bare
and
beyond
that
the
dark
shapes
of
the
barrowdowns
stalked
away
into
the
eastern
night

they
all
hurried
forward
hobbits
and
ponies
already
half
their
weariness
and
all
their
fears
had
fallen
from
them

hey
come
merry
dol

rolled
out
the
song
to
greet
them

hey
come
derry
dol
hop
along
my
hearties

hobbits
ponies
all
we
are
fond
of
parties

now
let
the
fun
begin
let
us
sing
together

then
another
clear
voice
as
young
and
as
ancient
as
spring
like
the
song
of
a
glad
water
flowing
down
into
the
night
from
a
bright
morning
in
the
hills
came
falling
like
silver
to
meet
them

now
let
the
song
begin
let
us
sing
together

of
sun
stars
moon
and
mist
rain
and
cloudy
weather

light
on
the
budding
leaf
dew
on
the
feather

wind
on
the
open
hill
bells
on
the
heather

reeds
by
the
shady

chapter
7


in
the
house
of
tom
bombadil


the
four
hobbits
stepped
over
the
wide
stone
threshold
and
stood
still
blinking
they
were
in
a
long
low
room
filled
with
the
light
of
lamps
swinging
from
the
beams
of
the
roof
and
on
the
table
of
dark
polished
wood
stood
many
candles
tall
and
yellow
burning
brightly

in
a
chair
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
facing
the
outer
door
sat
a
woman
her
long
yellow
hair
rippled
down
her
shoulders
her
gown
was
green
green
as
young
reeds
shot
with
silver
like
beads
of
dew
and
her
belt
was
of
gold
shaped
like
a
chain
of
flaglilies
set
with
the
paleblue
eyes
of
forgetmenots
about
her
feel
in
wide
vessels
of
green
and
brown
earthenware
white
waterlilies
were
floating
so
that
she
seemed
to
be
enthroned
in
the
midst
of
a
pool

'enter
good
guests'
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
they
knew
that
it
was
her
clear
voice
they
had
heard
singing
they
came
a
few
timid
steps
further
into
the
room
and
began
to
bow
low
feeling
strangely
surprised
and
awkward
like
folk
that
knocking
at
a
cottage
door
to
beg
for
a
drink
of
water
have
been
answered
by
a
fair
young
elfqueen
clad
in
living
flowers
but
before
they
could
say
anything
she
sprang
lightly
up
and
over
the
lilybowls
and
ran
laughing
towards
them
and
as
she
ran
her
gown
rustled
softly
like
the
wind
in
the
flowering
borders
of
a
river

'come
dear
folk'
she
said
taking
frodo
by
the
hand
'laugh
and
be
merry
I
am
goldberry
daughter
of
the
river'
then
lightly
she
passed
them
and
closing
the
door
she
turned
her
back
to
it
with
her
white
arms
spread
out
across
it
'let
us
shut
out
the
night'
she
said
'for
you
are
still
afraid
perhaps
of
mist
and
treeshadows
and
deep
water
and
untame
things
fear
nothing
for
tonight
you
are
under
the
roof
of
tom
bombadil'

the
hobbits
looked
at
her
in
wonder
and
she
looked
at
each
of
them
and
smiled
'fair
lady
goldberry'
said
frodo
at
last
feeling
his
heart
moved
with
a
joy
that
he
did
not
understand
he
stood
as
he
had
at
times
stood
enchanted
by
fair
elvenvoices
but
the
spell
that
was
now
laid
upon
him
was
different
less
keen
and
lofty
was
the
delight
but
deeper
and
nearer
to
mortal
heart
marvellous
and
yet
not
strange
'fair
lady
goldberry'
he
said
again
'now
the
joy
that
was
hidden
in
the
songs
we
heard
is
made
plain
to
me

o
slender
as
a
willowwand
o
clearer
than
clear
water

o
reed
by
the
living
pool
fair
riverdaughter

o
springtime
and
summertime
and
spring
again
after

o
wind
on
the
waterfall
and
the
leaves'
laughter'

suddenly
he
stopped
and
stammered
overcome
with
surprise
to
hear
himself
saying
such
things
but
goldberry
laughed

'welcome'
she
said
'i
had
not
heard
that
folk
of
the
shire
were
so
sweettongued
but
I
see
you
are
an
elffriend
the
light
in
your
eyes
and
the
ring
in
your
voice
tells
it
this
is
a
merry
meeting
sit
now
and
wait
for
the
master
of
the
house
he
will
not
be
long
he
is
tending
your
tired
beasts'

the
hobbits
sat
down
gladly
in
low
rushseated
chairs
while
goldberry
busied
herself
about
the
table
and
their
eyes
followed
her
for
the
slender
grace
of
her
movement
filled
them
with
quiet
delight
from
somewhere
behind
the
house
came
the
sound
of
singing
every
now
and
again
they
caught
among
many
a

derry
dol

and
a

merry
dol

and
a

ring
a
ding
dillo

the
repeated
words

old
tom
bombadil
is
a
merry
fellow

bright
blue
his
jacket
is
and
his
boots
are
yellow

'fair
lady'
said
frodo
again
after
a
while
'tell
me
if
my
asking
does
not
seem
foolish
who
is
tom
bombadil'

'he
is'
said
goldberry
staying
her
swift
movements
and
smiling

frodo
looked
at
her
questioningly
'he
is
as
you
have
seen
him'
she
said
in
answer
to
his
look
'he
is
the
master
of
wood
water
and
hill'

'then
all
this
strange
land
belongs
to
him'

'no
indeed'
she
answered
and
her
smile
faded
'that
would
indeed
be
a
burden'
she
added
in
a
low
voice
as
if
to
herself
'the
trees
and
the
grasses
and
all
things
growing
or
living
in
the
land
belong
each
to
themselves
tom
bombadil
is
the
master
no
one
has
ever
caught
old
tom
walking
in
the
forest
wading
in
the
water
leaping
on
the
hilltops
under
light
and
shadow
he
has
no
fear
tom
bombadil
is
master'

a
door
opened
and
in
came
tom
bombadil
he
had
now
no
hat
and
his
thick
brown
hair
was
crowned
with
autumn
leaves
he
laughed
and
going
to
goldberry
took
her
hand

'here's
my
pretty
lady'
he
said
bowing
to
the
hobbits
'here's
my
goldberry
clothed
all
in
silvergreen
with
flowers
in
her
girdle
is
the
table
laden
I
see
yellow
cream
and
honeycomb
and
white
bread
and
butter
milk
cheese
and
green
herbs
and
ripe
berries
gathered
is
that
enough
for
us
is
the
supper
ready'

'it
is'
said
goldberry
'but
the
guests
perhaps
are
not'

tom
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
'tom
tom
your
guests
are
tired
and
you
had
near
forgotten
come
now
my
merry
friends
and
tom
will
refresh
you
you
shall
clean
grimy
hands
and
wash
your
weary
faces
cast
off
your
muddy
cloaks
and
comb
out
your
tangles'

he
opened
the
door
and
they
followed
him
down
a
short
passage
and
round
a
sharp
turn
they
came
to
a
low
room
with
a
sloping
roof
a
penthouse
it
seemed
built
on
to
the
north
end
of
the
house
its
walls
were
of
clean
stone
but
they
were
mostly
covered
with
green
hanging
mats
and
yellow
curtains
the
floor
was
flagged
and
strewn
with
fresh
green
rushes
there
were
four
deep
mattresses
each
piled
with
white
blankets
laid
on
the
floor
along
one
side
against
the
opposite
wall
was
a
long
bench
laden
with
wide
earthenware
basins
and
beside
it
stood
brown
ewers
filled
with
water
some
cold
some
steaming
hot
there
were
soft
green
slippers
set
ready
beside
each
bed


before
long
washed
and
refreshed
the
hobbits
were
seated
at
the
table
two
on
each
side
while
at
either
end
sat
goldberry
and
the
master
it
was
a
long
and
merry
meal
though
the
hobbits
ate
as
only
famished
hobbits
can
eat
there
was
no
lack
the
drink
in
their
drinkingbowls
seemed
to
be
clear
cold
water
yet
it
went
to
their
hearts
like
wine
and
set
free
their
voices
the
guests
became
suddenly
aware
that
they
were
singing
merrily
as
if
it
was
easier
and
more
natural
than
talking

at
last
tom
and
goldberry
rose
and
cleared
the
table
swiftly
the
guests
were
commanded
to
sit
quiet
and
were
set
in
chairs
each
with
a
footstool
to
his
tired
feet
there
was
a
fire
in
the
wide
hearth
before
them
and
it
was
burning
with
a
sweet
smell
as
if
it
were
built
of
applewood
when
everything
was
set
in
order
all
the
lights
in
the
room
were
put
out
except
one
lamp
and
a
pair
of
candles
at
each
end
of
the
chimneyshelf
then
goldberry
came
and
stood
before
them
holding
a
candle
and
she
wished
them
each
a
good
night
and
deep
sleep

'have
peace
now'
she
said
'until
the
morning
heed
no
nightly
noises
for
nothing
passes
door
and
window
here
save
moonlight
and
starlight
and
the
wind
off
the
hilltop
good
night'
she
passed
out
of
the
room
with
a
glimmer
and
a
rustle
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
was
like
a
stream
falling
gently
away
downhill
over
cool
stones
in
the
quiet
of
night

tom
sat
on
a
while
beside
them
in
silence
while
each
of
them
tried
to
muster
the
courage
to
ask
one
of
the
many
questions
he
had
meant
to
ask
at
supper
sleep
gathered
on
their
eyelids
at
last
frodo
spoke

'did
you
hear
me
calling
master
or
was
it
just
chance
that
brought
you
at
that
moment'

tom
stirred
like
a
man
shaken
out
of
a
pleasant
dream
'eh
what'
said
he
'did
I
hear
you
calling
nay
I
did
not
hear
I
was
busy
singing
just
chance
brought
me
then
if
chance
you
call
it
it
was
no
plan
of
mine
though
I
was
waiting
for
you
we
heard
news
of
you
and
learned
that
you
were
wandering
we
guessed
you'd
come
ere
long
down
to
the
water
all
paths
lead
that
way
down
to
withywindle
old
grey
willowman
he's
a
mighty
singer
and
it's
hard
for
little
folk
to
escape
his
cunning
mazes
but
tom
had
an
errand
there
that
he
dared
not
hinder'
tom
nodded
as
if
sleep
was
taking
him
again
but
he
went
on
in
a
soft
singing
voice

I
had
an
errand
there
gathering
waterlilies

green
leaves
and
lilies
white
to
please
my
pretty
lady

the
last
ere
the
year's
end
to
keep
them
from
the
winter

to
flower
by
her
pretty
feet
tilt
the
snows
are
melted

each
year
at
summer's
end
I
go
to
find
them
for
her

in
a
wide
pool
deep
and
clear
far
down
withywindle

there
they
open
first
in
spring
and
there
they
linger
latest

by
that
pool
long
ago
I
found
the
riverdaughter

fair
young
goldberry
sitting
in
the
rushes

sweet
was
her
singing
then
and
her
heart
was
beating


he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
them
with
a
sudden
glint
of
blue

and
that
proved
well
for
you

for
now
I
shall
no
longer

go
down
deep
again
along
the
forestwater

not
while
the
year
is
old
nor
shall
I
be
passing

old
man
willow's
house
this
side
of
springtime

not
till
the
merry
spring
when
the
riverdaughter

dances
down
the
withypath
to
bathe
in
the
water


he
fell
silent
again
but
frodo
could
not
help
asking
one
more
question
the
one
he
most
desired
to
have
answered
'tell
us
master'
he
said
'about
the
willowman
what
is
he
I
have
never
heard
of
him
before'


'no
don't'
said
merry
and
pippin
together
sitting
suddenly
upright
'not
now
not
until
the
morning'

'that
is
right'
said
the
old
man
'now
is
the
time
for
resting
some
things
are
ill
to
hear
when
the
world's
in
shadow
sleep
till
the
morninglight
rest
on
the
pillow
heed
no
nightly
noise
fear
no
grey
willow'
and
with
that
he
took
down
the
lamp
and
blew
it
out
and
grasping
a
candle
in
either
hand
he
led
them
out
of
the
room

their
mattresses
and
pillows
were
soft
as
down
and
the
blankets
were
of
white
wool
they
had
hardly
laid
themselves
on
the
deep
beds
and
drawn
the
light
covers
over
them
before
they
were
asleep

in
the
dead
night
frodo
lay
in
a
dream
without
light
then
he
saw
the
young
moon
rising
under
its
thin
light
there
loomed
before
him
a
black
wall
of
rock
pierced
by
a
dark
arch
like
a
great
gate
it
seemed
to
frodo
that
he
was
lifted
up
and
passing
over
he
saw
that
the
rockwall
was
a
circle
of
hills
and
that
within
it
was
a
plain
and
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
stood
a
pinnacle
of
stone
like
a
vast
tower
but
not
made
by
hands
on
its
top
stood
the
figure
of
a
man
the
moon
as
it
rose
seemed
to
hang
for
a
moment
above
his
head
and
glistened
in
his
white
hair
as
the
wind
stirred
it
up
from
the
dark
plain
below
came
the
crying
of
fell
voices
and
the
howling
of
many
wolves
suddenly
a
shadow
like
the
shape
of
great
wings
passed
across
the
moon
the
figure
lifted
his
arms
and
a
light
flashed
from
the
staff
that
he
wielded
a
mighty
eagle
swept
down
and
bore
him
away
the
voices
wailed
and
the
wolves
yammered
there
was
a
noise
like
a
strong
wind
blowing
and
on
it
was
borne
the
sound
of
hoofs
galloping
galloping
galloping
from
the
east
'black
riders'
thought
frodo
as
he
wakened
with
the
sound
of
the
hoofs
still
echoing
in
his
mind
he
wondered
if
he
would
ever
again
have
the
courage
to
leave
the
safety
of
these
stone
walls
he
lay
motionless
still
listening
but
all
was
now
silent
and
at
last
he
turned
and
fell
asleep
again
or
wandered
into
some
other
unremembered
dream

at
his
side
pippin
lay
dreaming
pleasantly
but
a
change
came
over
his
dreams
and
he
turned
and
groaned
suddenly
he
woke
or
thought
he
had
waked
and
yet
still
heard
in
the
darkness
the
sound
that
had
disturbed
his
dream

tiptap
squeak

the
noise
was
like
branches
fretting
in
the
wind
twigfingers
scraping
wall
and
window

creak
creak
creak

he
wondered
if
there
were
willowtrees
close
to
the
house
and
then
suddenly
he
had
a
dreadful
feeling
that
he
was
not
in
an
ordinary
house
at
all
but
inside
the
willow
and
listening
to
that
horrible
dry
creaking
voice
laughing
at
him
again
he
sat
up
and
felt
the
soft
pillows
yield
to
his
hands
and
he
lay
down
again
relieved
he
seemed
to
hear
the
echo
of
words
in
his
ears
'fear
nothing
have
peace
until
the
morning
heed
no
nightly
noises'
then
he
went
to
sleep
again

it
was
the
sound
of
water
that
merry
heard
falling
into
his
quiet
sleep
water
streaming
down
gently
and
then
spreading
spreading
irresistibly
all
round
the
house
into
a
dark
shoreless
pool
it
gurgled
under
the
walls
and
was
rising
slowly
but
surely
'i
shall
be
drowned'
he
thought
it
will
find
its
way
in
and
then
I
shall
drown'
he
felt
that
he
was
lying
in
a
soft
slimy
bog
and
springing
up
he
set
his
fool
on
the
corner
of
a
cold
hard
flagstone
then
he
remembered
where
he
was
and
lay
down
again
he
seemed
to
hear
or
remember
hearing
'nothing
passes
doors
or
windows
save
moonlight
and
starlight
and
the
wind
off
the
hilltop'
a
little
breath
of
sweet
air
moved
the
curtain
he
breathed
deep
and
fell
asleep
again

as
far
as
he
could
remember
sam
slept
through
the
night
in
deep
content
if
logs
are
contented

they
woke
up
all
four
at
once
in
the
morning
light
tom
was
moving
about
the
room
whistling
like
a
starling
when
he
heard
them
stir
he
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
'hey
come
merry
dol
derry
dol
my
hearties'
he
drew
back
the
yellow
curtains
and
the
hobbits
saw
that
these
had
covered
the
windows
at
either
end
of
the
room
one
looking
east
and
the
other
looking
west

they
leapt
up
refreshed
frodo
ran
to
the
eastern
window
and
found
himself
looking
into
a
kitchengarden
grey
with
dew
he
had
half
expected
to
see
turf
right
up
to
the
walls
turf
all
pocked
with
hoofprints
actually
his
view
was
screened
by
a
tall
line
of
beans
on
poles
but
above
and
far
beyond
them
the
grey
top
of
the
hill
loomed
up
against
the
sunrise
it
was
a
pale
morning
in
the
east
behind
long
clouds
like
lines
of
soiled
wool
stained
red
at
the
edges
lay
glimmering
deeps
of
yellow
the
sky
spoke
of
rain
to
come
but
the
light
was
broadening
quickly
and
the
red
flowers
on
the
beans
began
to
glow
against
the
wet
green
leaves

pippin
looked
out
of
the
western
window
down
into
a
pool
of
mist
the
forest
was
hidden
under
a
fog
it
was
like
looking
down
on
to
a
sloping
cloudroof
from
above
there
was
a
fold
or
channel
where
the
mist
was
broken
into
many
plumes
and
billows
the
valley
of
the
withywindle
the
stream
ran
down
the
hill
on
the
left
and
vanished
into
the
white
shadows
near
at
hand
was
a
flowergarden
and
a
clipped
hedge
silvernetted
and
beyond
that
grey
shaven
grass
pale
with
dewdrops
there
was
no
willowtree
to
be
seen

'good
morning
merry
friends'
cried
tom
opening
the
eastern
window
wide
a
cool
air
flowed
in
it
had
a
rainy
smell
'sun
won't
show
her
face
much
today
i'm
thinking
I
have
been
walking
wide
leaping
on
the
hilltops
since
the
grey
dawn
began
nosing
wind
and
weather
wet
grass
underfoot
wet
sky
above
me
I
wakened
goldberry
singing
under
window
but
nought
wakes
hobbitfolk
in
the
early
morning
in
the
night
little
folk
wake
up
in
the
darkness
and
sleep
after
light
has
come
ring
a
ding
dillo
wake
now
my
merry
friends
forget
the
nightly
noises
ring
a
ding
dillo
del
derry
del
my
hearties
if
you
come
soon
you'll
find
breakfast
on
the
table
if
you
come
late
you'll
get
grass
and
rainwater'

needless
to
say

not
that
tom's
threat
sounded
very
serious

the
hobbits
came
soon
and
left
the
table
late
and
only
when
it
was
beginning
lo
look
rather
empty
neither
tom
nor
goldberry
were
there
tom
could
be
heard
about
the
house
clattering
in
the
kitchen
and
up
and
down
the
stairs
and
singing
here
and
there
outside
the
room
looked
westward
over
the
mistclouded
valley
and
the
window
was
open
water
dripped
down
from
the
thatched
eaves
above
before
they
had
finished
breakfast
the
clouds
had
joined
into
an
unbroken
roof
and
a
straight
grey
rain
came
softly
and
steadily
down
behind
its
deep
curtain
the
forest
was
completely
veiled

as
they
looked
out
of
the
window
there
came
falling
gently
as
if
it
was
flowing
down
the
rain
out
of
the
sky
the
clear
voice
of
goldberry
singing
up
above
them
they
could
hear
few
words
but
it
seemed
plain
to
them
that
the
song
was
a
rainsong
as
sweet
as
showers
on
dry
hills
that
told
the
tale
of
a
river
from
the
spring
in
the
highlands
to
the
sea
far
below
the
hobbits
listened
with
delight
and
frodo
was
glad
in
his
heart
and
blessed
the
kindly
weather
because
it
delayed
them
from
departing
the
thought
of
going
had
been
heavy
upon
him
from
the
moment
he
awoke
but
he
guessed
now
that
they
would
not
go
further
that
day

the
upper
wind
settled
in
the
west
and
deeper
and
wetter
clouds
rolled
up
to
spill
their
laden
rain
on
the
bare
heads
of
the
downs
nothing
could
be
seen
all
round
the
house
but
falling
water
frodo
stood
near
the
open
door
and
watched
the
white
chalky
path
turn
into
a
little
river
of
milk
and
go
bubbling
away
down
into
the
valley
tom
bombadil
came
trotting
round
the
corner
of
the
house
waving
his
arms
as
if
he
was
warding
off
the
rain

and
indeed
when
he
sprang
over
the
threshold
he
seemed
quite
dry
except
for
his
boots
these
he
took
off
and
put
in
the
chimneycorner
then
he
sat
in
the
largest
chair
and
called
the
hobbits
to
gather
round
him

'this
is
goldberry's
washing
day'
he
said
'and
her
autumncleaning
too
wet
for
hobbitfolk

let
them
rest
while
they
are
able
it's
a
good
day
for
long
tales
for
questions
and
for
answers
so
tom
will
start
the
talking'

he
then
told
them
many
remarkable
stories
sometimes
half
as
if
speaking
to
himself
sometimes
looking
at
them
suddenly
with
a
bright
blue
eye
under
his
deep
brows
often
his
voice
would
turn
to
song
and
he
would
get
out
of
his
chair
and
dance
about
he
told
them
tales
of
bees
and
flowers
the
ways
of
trees
and
the
strange
creatures
of
the
forest
about
the
evil
things
and
good
things
things
friendly
and
things
unfriendly
cruel
things
and
kind
things
and
secrets
hidden
under
brambles

as
they
listened
they
began
to
understand
the
lives
of
the
forest
apart
from
themselves
indeed
to
feel
themselves
as
the
strangers
where
all
other
things
were
at
home
moving
constantly
in
and
out
of
his
talk
was
old
man
willow
and
frodo
learned
now
enough
to
content
him
indeed
more
than
enough
for
it
was
not
comfortable
lore
tom's
words
laid
bare
the
hearts
of
trees
and
their
thoughts
which
were
often
dark
and
strange
and
filled
with
a
hatred
of
things
that
go
free
upon
the
earth
gnawing
biting
breaking
hacking
burning
destroyers
and
usurpers
it
was
not
called
the
old
forest
without
reason
for
it
was
indeed
ancient
a
survivor
of
vast
forgotten
woods
and
in
it
there
lived
yet
ageing
no
quicker
than
the
hills
the
fathers
of
the
fathers
of
trees
remembering
times
when
they
were
lords
the
countless
years
had
filled
them
with
pride
and
rooted
wisdom
and
with
malice
but
none
were
more
dangerous
than
the
great
willow
his
heart
was
rotten
but
his
strength
was
green
and
he
was
cunning
and
a
master
of
winds
and
his
song
and
thought
ran
through
the
woods
on
both
sides
of
the
river
his
grey
thirsty
spirit
drew
power
out
of
the
earth
and
spread
like
fine
rootthreads
in
the
ground
and
invisible
twigfingers
in
the
air
till
it
had
under
its
dominion
nearly
all
the
trees
of
the
forest
from
the
hedge
to
the
downs

suddenly
tom's
talk
left
the
woods
and
went
leaping
up
the
young
stream
over
bubbling
waterfalls
over
pebbles
and
worn
rocks
and
among
small
flowers
in
close
grass
and
wet
crannies
wandering
at
last
up
on
to
the
downs
they
heard
of
the
great
barrows
and
the
green
mounds
and
the
stonerings
upon
the
hills
and
in
the
hollows
among
the
hills
sheep
were
bleating
in
flocks
green
walls
and
white
walls
rose
there
were
fortresses
on
the
heights
kings
of
little
kingdoms
fought
together
and
the
young
sun
shone
like
fire
on
the
red
metal
of
their
new
and
greedy
swords
there
was
victory
and
defeat
and
towers
fell
fortresses
were
burned
and
flames
went
up
into
the
sky
gold
was
piled
on
the
biers
of
dead
kings
and
queens
and
mounds
covered
them
and
the
stone
doors
were
shut
and
the
grass
grew
over
all
sheep
walked
for
a
while
biting
the
grass
but
soon
the
hills
were
empty
again
a
shadow
came
out
of
dark
places
far
away
and
the
bones
were
stirred
in
the
mounds
barrowwights
walked
in
the
hollow
places
with
a
clink
of
rings
on
cold
fingers
and
gold
chains
in
the
wind'
stone
rings
grinned
out
of
the
ground
like
broken
teeth
in
the
moonlight

the
hobbits
shuddered
even
in
the
shire
the
rumour
of
the
barrowwights
of
the
barrowdowns
beyond
the
forest
had
been
heard
but
it
was
not
a
tale
that
any
hobbit
liked
to
listen
to
even
by
a
comfortable
fireside
far
away
these
four
now
suddenly
remembered
what
the
joy
of
this
house
had
driven
from
their
minds
the
house
of
tom
bombadil
nestled
under
the
very
shoulder
of
those
dreaded
hills
they
lost
the
thread
of
his
tale
and
shifted
uneasily
looking
aside
at
one
another

when
they
caught
his
words
again
they
found
that
he
had
now
wandered
into
strange
regions
beyond
their
memory
and
beyond
their
waking
thought
into
limes
when
the
world
was
wider
and
the
seas
flowed
straight
to
the
western
shore
and
still
on
and
back
tom
went
singing
out
into
ancient
starlight
when
only
the
elfsires
were
awake
then
suddenly
he
slopped
and
they
saw
that
he
nodded
as
if
he
was
falling
asleep
the
hobbits
sat
still
before
him
enchanted
and
it
seemed
as
if
under
the
spell
of
his
words
the
wind
had
gone
and
the
clouds
had
dried
up
and
the
day
had
been
withdrawn
and
darkness
had
come
from
east
and
west
and
all
the
sky
was
filled
with
the
light
of
white
stars

whether
the
morning
and
evening
of
one
day
or
of
many
days
had
passed
frodo
could
not
tell
he
did
not
feel
either
hungry
or
tired
only
filled
with
wonder
the
stars
shone
through
the
window
and
the
silence
of
the
heavens
seemed
to
be
round
him
he
spoke
at
last
out
of
his
wonder
and
a
sudden
fear
of
that
silence

'who
are
you
master'
he
asked

'eh
what'
said
tom
sitting
up
and
his
eyes
glinting
in
the
gloom
'don't
you
know
my
name
yet
that's
the
only
answer
tell
me
who
are
you
alone
yourself
and
nameless
but
you
are
young
and
I
am
old
eldest
that's
what
I
am
mark
my
words
my
friends
tom
was
here
before
the
river
and
the
trees
tom
remembers
the
first
raindrop
and
the
first
acorn
he
made
paths
before
the
big
people
and
saw
the
little
people
arriving
he
was
here
before
the
kings
and
the
graves
and
the
barrowwights
when
the
elves
passed
westward
tom
was
here
already
before
the
seas
were
bent
he
knew
the
dark
under
the
stars
when
it
was
fearless

before
the
dark
lord
came
from
outside'


a
shadow
seemed
to
pass
by
the
window
and
the
hobbits
glanced
hastily
through
the
panes
when
they
turned
again
goldberry
stood
in
the
door
behind
framed
in
light
she
held
a
candle
shielding
its
flame
from
the
draught
with
her
hand
and
the
light
flowed
through
it
like
sunlight
through
a
white
shell

'the
rain
has
ended'
she
said
'and
new
waters
are
running
downhill
under
the
stars
let
us
now
laugh
and
be
glad'

'and
let
us
have
food
and
drink'
cried
tom
'long
tales
are
thirsty
and
long
listening's
hungry
work
morning
noon
and
evening'
with
that
he
jumped
out
of
his
chair
and
with
a
bound
took
a
candle
from
the
chimneyshelf
and
lit
it
in
the
flame
that
goldberry
held
then
he
danced
about
the
table
suddenly
he
hopped
through
the
door
and
disappeared

quickly
he
returned
bearing
a
large
and
laden
tray
then
tom
and
goldberry
set
the
table
and
the
hobbits
sat
half
in
wonder
and
half
in
laughter
so
fair
was
the
grace
of
goldberry
and
so
merry
and
odd
the
caperings
of
tom
yet
in
some
fashion
they
seemed
to
weave
a
single
dance
neither
hindering
the
other
in
and
out
of
the
room
and
round
about
the
table
and
with
great
speed
food
and
vessels
and
lights
were
set
in
order
the
boards
blazed
with
candles
white
and
yellow
tom
bowed
to
his
guests
'supper
is
ready'
said
goldberry
and
now
the
hobbits
saw
that
she
was
clothed
all
in
silver
with
a
white
girdle
and
her
shoes
were
like
fishes'
mail
but
tom
was
all
in
clean
blue
blue
as
rainwashed
forgetmenots
and
he
had
green
stockings

it
was
a
supper
even
better
than
before
the
hobbits
under
the
spell
of
tom's
words
may
have
missed
one
meal
or
many
but
when
the
food
was
before
them
it
seemed
at
least
a
week
since
they
had
eaten
they
did
not
sing
or
even
speak
much
for
a
while
and
paid
close
attention
to
business
but
after
a
time
their
hearts
and
spirit
rose
high
again
and
their
voices
rang
out
in
mirth
and
laughter

after
they
had
eaten
goldberry
sang
many
songs
for
them
songs
that
began
merrily
in
the
hills
and
fell
softly
down
into
silence
and
in
the
silences
they
saw
in
their
minds
pools
and
waters
wider
than
any
they
had
known
and
looking
into
them
they
saw
the
sky
below
them
and
the
stars
like
jewels
in
the
depths
then
once
more
she
wished
them
each
good
night
and
left
them
by
the
fireside
but
tom
now
seemed
wide
awake
and
plied
them
with
questions

he
appeared
already
to
know
much
about
them
and
all
their
families
and
indeed
to
know
much
of
all
the
history
and
doings
of
the
shire
down
from
days
hardly
remembered
among
the
hobbits
themselves
it
no
longer
surprised
them
but
he
made
no
secret
that
he
owed
his
recent
knowledge
largely
to
farmer
maggot
whom
he
seemed
to
regard
as
a
person
of
more
importance
than
they
had
imagined
'there's
earth
under
his
old
feet
and
clay
on
his
fingers
wisdom
in
his
bones
and
both
his
eyes
are
open'
said
tom
it
was
also
clear
that
tom
had
dealings
with
the
elves
and
it
seemed
that
in
some
fashion
news
had
reached
him
from
gildor
concerning
the
flight
of
frodo

indeed
so
much
did
tom
know
and
so
cunning
was
his
questioning
that
frodo
found
himself
telling
him
more
about
bilbo
and
his
own
hopes
and
fears
than
he
had
told
before
even
to
gandalf
tom
wagged
his
head
up
and
down
and
there
was
a
glint
in
his
eyes
when
he
heard
of
the
riders

'show
me
the
precious
ring'
he
said
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
story
and
frodo
to
his
own
astonishment
drew
out
the
chain
from
his
pocket
and
unfastening
the
ring
handed
it
at
once
to
tom

it
seemed
to
grow
larger
as
it
lay
for
a
moment
on
his
big
brownskinned
hand
then
suddenly
he
put
it
to
his
eye
and
laughed
for
a
second
the
hobbits
had
a
vision
both
comical
and
alarming
of
his
bright
blue
eye
gleaming
through
a
circle
of
gold
then
tom
put
the
ring
round
the
end
of
his
little
finger
and
held
it
up
to
the
candlelight
for
a
moment
the
hobbits
noticed
nothing
strange
about
this
then
they
gasped
there
was
no
sign
of
tom
disappearing

tom
laughed
again
and
then
he
spun
the
ring
in
the
air

and
it
vanished
with
a
flash
frodo
gave
a
cry

and
tom
leaned
forward
and
handed
it
back
to
him
with
a
smile

frodo
looked
at
it
closely
and
rather
suspiciously
like
one
who
has
lent
a
trinket
to
a
juggler
it
was
the
same
ring
or
looked
the
same
and
weighed
the
same
for
that
ring
had
always
seemed
to
frodo
to
weigh
strangely
heavy
in
the
hand
but
something
prompted
him
to
make
sure
he
was
perhaps
a
trifle
annoyed
with
tom
for
seeming
to
make
so
light
of
what
even
gandalf
thought
so
perilously
important
he
waited
for
an
opportunity
when
the
talk
was
going
again
and
tom
was
telling
an
absurd
story
about
badgers
and
their
queer
ways

then
he
slipped
the
ring
on

merry
turned
towards
him
to
say
something
and
gave
a
start
and
checked
an
exclamation
frodo
was
delighted
in
a
way
it
was
his
own
ring
all
right
for
merry
was
staring
blankly
at
his
chair
and
obviously
could
not
see
him
he
got
up
and
crept
quietly
away
from
the
fireside
towards
the
outer
door

'hey
there'
cried
tom
glancing
towards
him
with
a
most
seeing
look
in
his
shining
eyes
'hey
come
frodo
there
where
be
you
agoing
old
tom
bombadil's
not
as
blind
as
that
yet
take
off
your
golden
ring
your
hand's
more
fair
without
it
come
back
leave
your
game
and
sit
down
beside
me
we
must
talk
a
while
more
and
think
about
the
morning
tom
must
teach
the
right
road
and
keep
your
feet
from
wandering'

frodo
laughed
trying
to
feel
pleased
and
taking
off
the
ring
he
came
and
sat
down
again
tom
now
told
them
that
he
reckoned
the
sun
would
shine
tomorrow
and
it
would
be
a
glad
morning
and
setting
out
would
be
hopeful
but
they
would
do
well
to
start
early
for
weather
in
that
country
was
a
thing
that
even
tom
could
not
be
sure
of
for
long
and
it
would
change
sometimes
quicker
than
he
could
change
his
jacket
'i
am
no
weathermaster'
he
said
'nor
is
aught
that
goes
on
two
legs'

by
his
advice
they
decided
to
make
nearly
due
north
from
his
house
over
the
western
and
lower
slopes
of
the
downs
they
might
hope
in
that
way
to
strike
the
east
road
in
a
day's
journey
and
avoid
the
barrows
he
told
them
not
to
be
afraid

but
to
mind
their
own
business

'keep
to
the
green
grass
don't
you
go
ameddling
with
old
stone
or
cold
wights
or
prying
in
their
houses
unless
you
be
strong
folk
with
hearts
that
never
falter'
he
said
this
more
than
once
and
he
advised
them
to
pass
barrows
by
on
the
westside
if
they
chanced
to
stray
near
one
then
he
taught
them
a
rhyme
to
sing
if
they
should
by
illluck
fall
into
any
danger
or
difficulty
the
next
day

when
they
had
sung
this
altogether
after
him
he
clapped
them
each
on
the
shoulder
with
a
laugh
and
taking
candles
led
them
back
to
their
bedroom

fog
on
the
barrowdowns


that
night
they
heard
no
noises
but
either
in
his
dreams
or
out
of
them
he
could
not
tell
which
frodo
heard
a
sweet
singing
running
in
his
mind
a
song
that
seemed
to
come
like
a
pale
light
behind
a
grey
raincurtain
and
growing
stronger
to
turn
the
veil
all
to
glass
and
silver
until
at
last
it
was
rolled
back
and
a
far
green
country
opened
before
him
under
a
swift
sunrise

the
vision
melted
into
waking
and
there
was
tom
whistling
like
a
treefull
of
birds
and
the
sun
was
already
slanting
down
the
hill
and
through
the
open
window
outside
everything
was
green
and
pale
gold

after
breakfast
which
they
again
ate
alone
they
made
ready
to
say
farewell
as
nearly
heavy
of
heart
as
was
possible
on
such
a
morning
cool
bright
and
clean
under
a
washed
autumn
sky
of
thin
blue
the
air
came
fresh
from
the
northwest
their
quiet
ponies
were
almost
frisky
sniffing
and
moving
restlessly
tom
came
out
of
the
house
and
waved
his
hat
and
danced
upon
the
doorstep
bidding
the
hobbits
to
get
up
and
be
off
and
go
with
good
speed

they
rode
off
along
a
path
that
wound
away
from
behind
the
house
and
went
slanting
up
towards
the
north
end
of
the
hillbrow
under
which
it
sheltered
they
had
just
dismounted
to
lead
their
ponies
up
the
last
steep
slope
when
suddenly
frodo
stopped

'goldberry'
he
cried
'my
fair
lady
clad
all
in
silver
green
we
have
never
said
farewell
to
her
nor
seen
her
since
the
evening'
he
was
so
distressed
that
he
turned
back
but
at
that
moment
a
clear
call
came
rippling
down
there
on
the
hillbrow
she
stood
beckoning
to
them
her
hair
was
flying
loose
and
as
it
caught
the
sun
it
shone
and
shimmered
a
light
like
the
glint
of
water
on
dewy
grass
flashed
from
under
her
feet
as
she
danced

they
hastened
up
the
last
slope
and
stood
breathless
beside
her
they
bowed
but
with
a
wave
of
her
arm
she
bade
them
look
round
and
they
looked
out
from
the
hilltop
over
lands
under
the
morning
it
was
now
as
clear
and
farseen
as
it
had
been
veiled
and
misty
when
they
stood
upon
the
knoll
in
the
forest
which
could
now
be
seen
rising
pale
and
green
out
of
the
dark
trees
in
the
west
in
that
direction
the
land
rose
in
wooded
ridges
green
yellow
russet
under
the
sun
beyond
which
lay
hidden
the
valley
of
the
brandywine
to
the
south
over
the
line
of
the
withywindle
there
was
a
distant
glint
like
pale
glass
where
the
brandywine
river
made
a
great
loop
in
the
lowlands
and
flowed
away
out
of
the
knowledge
of
the
hobbits
northward
beyond
the
dwindling
downs
the
land
ran
away
in
flats
and
swellings
of
grey
and
green
and
pale
earthcolours
until
it
faded
into
a
featureless
and
shadowy
distance
eastward
the
barrowdowns
rose
ridge
behind
ridge
into
the
morning
and
vanished
out
of
eyesight
into
a
guess
it
was
no
more
than
a
guess
of
blue
and
a
remote
white
glimmer
blending
with
the
hem
of
the
sky
but
it
spoke
to
them
out
of
memory
and
old
tales
of
the
high
and
distant
mountains

they
took
a
deep
draught
of
the
air
and
felt
that
a
skip
and
a
few
stout
strides
would
bear
them
wherever
they
wished
it
seemed
fainthearted
to
go
jogging
aside
over
the
crumpled
skirts
of
the
downs
towards
the
road
when
they
should
be
leaping
as
lusty
as
tom
over
the
stepping
stones
of
the
hills
straight
towards
the
mountains

goldberry
spoke
to
them
and
recalled
their
eyes
and
thoughts
'speed
now
fair
guests'
she
said
'and
hold
to
your
purpose
north
with
the
wind
in
the
left
eye
and
a
blessing
on
your
footsteps
make
haste
while
the
sun
shines'
and
to
frodo
she
said
'farewell
elffriend
it
was
a
merry
meeting'

but
frodo
found
no
words
to
answer
he
bowed
low
and
mounted
his
pony
and
followed
by
his
friends
jogged
slowly
down
the
gentle
slope
behind
the
hill
tom
bombadil's
house
and
the
valley
and
the
forest
were
lost
to
view
the
air
grew
warmer
between
the
green
walls
of
hillside
and
hillside
and
the
scent
of
turf
rose
strong
and
sweet
as
they
breathed
turning
back
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
green
hollow
they
saw
goldberry
now
small
and
slender
like
a
sunlit
flower
against
the
sky
she
was
standing
still
watching
them
and
her
hands
were
stretched
out
towards
them
as
they
looked
she
gave
a
clear
call
and
lifting
up
her
hand
she
turned
and
vanished
behind
the
hill

their
way
wound
along
the
floor
of
the
hollow
and
round
the
green
feet
of
a
steep
hill
into
another
deeper
and
broader
valley
and
then
over
the
shoulder
of
further
hills
and
down
their
long
limbs
and
up
their
smooth
sides
again
up
on
to
new
hilltops
and
down
into
new
valleys
there
was
no
tree
nor
any
visible
water
it
was
a
country
of
grass
and
short
springy
turf
silent
except
for
the
whisper
of
the
air
over
the
edges
of
the
land
and
high
lonely
cries
of
strange
birds
as
they
journeyed
the
sun
mounted
and
grew
hot
each
time
they
climbed
a
ridge
the
breeze
seemed
to
have
grown
less
when
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
country
westward
the
distant
forest
seemed
to
be
smoking
as
if
the
fallen
rain
was
steaming
up
again
from
leaf
and
root
and
mould
a
shadow
now
lay
round
the
edge
of
sight
a
dark
haze
above
which
the
upper
sky
was
like
a
blue
cap
hot
and
heavy


about
midday
they
came
to
a
hill
whose
top
was
wide
and
flattened
like
a
shallow
saucer
with
a
green
mounded
rim
inside
there
was
no
air
stirring
and
the
sky
seemed
near
their
heads
they
rode
across
and
looked
northwards
then
their
hearts
rose
for
it
seemed
plain
that
they
had
come
further
already
than
they
had
expected
certainly
the
distances
had
now
all
become
hazy
and
deceptive
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
downs
were
coming
to
an
end
a
long
valley
lay
below
them
winding
away
northwards
until
it
came
to
an
opening
between
two
steep
shoulders
beyond
there
seemed
to
be
no
more
hills
due
north
they
faintly
glimpsed
a
long
dark
line
that
is
a
line
of
trees'
said
merry
'and
that
must
mark
the
road
all
along
it
for
many
leagues
east
of
the
bridge
there
are
trees
growing
some
say
they
were
planted
in
the
old
days'

'splendid'
said
frodo
'if
we
make
as
good
going
this
afternoon
as
we
have
done
this
morning
we
shall
have
left
the
downs
before
the
sun
sets
and
be
jogging
on
in
search
of
a
camping
place'
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
turned
his
glance
eastwards
and
he
saw
that
on
that
side
the
hills
were
higher
and
looked
down
upon
them
and
all
those
hills
were
crowned
with
green
mounds
and
on
some
were
standing
stones
pointing
upwards
like
jagged
teeth
out
of
green
gums

that
view
was
somehow
disquieting
so
they
turned
from
the
sight
and
went
down
into
the
hollow
circle
in
the
midst
of
it
there
stood
a
single
stone
standing
tall
under
the
sun
above
and
at
this
hour
casting
no
shadow
it
was
shapeless
and
yet
significant
like
a
landmark
or
a
guarding
finger
or
more
like
a
warning
but
they
were
now
hungry
and
the
sun
was
still
at
the
fearless
noon
so
they
set
their
backs
against
the
east
side
of
the
stone
it
was
cool
as
if
the
sun
had
had
no
power
to
warm
it
but
at
that
time
this
seemed
pleasant
there
they
took
food
and
drink
and
made
as
good
a
noonmeal
under
the
open
sky
as
anyone
could
wish
for
the
food
came
from
'down
under
hill'
tom
had
provided
them
with
plenty
for
the
comfort
of
the
day
their
ponies
unburdened
strayed
upon
the
grass

riding
over
the
hills
and
eating
their
fill
the
warm
sun
and
the
scent
of
turf
lying
a
little
too
long
stretching
out
their
legs
and
looking
at
the
sky
above
their
noses
these
things
are
perhaps
enough
to
explain
what
happened
however
that
may
be
they
woke
suddenly
and
uncomfortably
from
a
sleep
they
had
never
meant
to
take
the
standing
stone
was
cold
and
it
cast
a
long
pale
shadow
that
stretched
eastward
over
them
the
sun
a
pale
and
watery
yellow
was
gleaming
through
the
mist
just
above
the
west
wall
of
the
hollow
in
which
they
lay
north
south
and
east
beyond
the
wall
the
fog
was
thick
cold
and
white
the
air
was
silent
heavy
and
chill
their
ponies
were
standing
crowded
together
with
their
heads
down

the
hobbits
sprang
to
their
feet
in
alarm
and
ran
to
the
western
rim
they
found
that
they
were
upon
an
island
in
the
fog
even
as
they
looked
out
in
dismay
towards
the
setting
sun
it
sank
before
their
eyes
into
a
white
sea
and
a
cold
grey
shadow
sprang
up
in
the
east
behind
the
fog
rolled
up
to
the
walls
and
rose
above
them
and
as
it
mounted
it
bent
over
their
heads
until
it
became
a
roof
they
were
shut
in
a
hall
of
mist
whose
central
pillar
was
the
standing
stone

they
felt
as
if
a
trap
was
closing
about
them
but
they
did
not
quite
lose
heart
they
still
remembered
the
hopeful
view
they
had
had
of
the
line
of
the
road
ahead
and
they
still
knew
in
which
direction
it
lay
in
any
case
they
now
had
so
great
a
dislike
for
that
hollow
place
about
the
stone
that
no
thought
of
remaining
there
was
in
their
minds
they
packed
up
as
quickly
as
their
chilled
fingers
would
work

soon
they
were
leading
their
ponies
in
single
file
over
the
rim
and
down
the
long
northward
slope
of
the
hill
down
into
a
foggy
sea
as
they
went
down
the
mist
became
colder
and
damper
and
their
hair
hung
lank
and
dripping
on
their
foreheads
when
they
reached
the
bottom
it
was
so
cold
that
they
halted
and
got
out
cloaks
and
hoods
which
soon
became
bedewed
with
grey
drops
then
mounting
their
ponies
they
went
slowly
on
again
feeling
their
way
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
ground
they
were
steering
as
well
as
they
could
guess
for
the
gatelike
opening
at
the
far
northward
end
of
the
long
valley
which
they
had
seen
in
the
morning
once
they
were
through
the
gap
they
had
only
lo
keep
on
in
anything
like
a
straight
line
and
they
were
bound
in
the
end
to
strike
the
road
their
thoughts
did
not
go
beyond
that
except
for
a
vague
hope
that
perhaps
away
beyond
the
downs
there
might
be
no
fog

their
going
was
very
slow
to
prevent
their
getting
separated
and
wandering
in
different
directions
they
went
in
file
with
frodo
leading
sam
was
behind
him
and
after
him
came
pippin
and
then
merry
the
valley
seemed
to
stretch
on
endlessly
suddenly
frodo
saw
a
hopeful
sign
on
either
side
ahead
a
darkness
began
to
loom
through
the
mist
and
he
guessed
that
they
were
at
last
approaching
the
gap
in
the
hills
the
northgate
of
the
barrowdowns
if
they
could
pass
that
they
would
be
free

'come
on
follow
me'
he
called
back
over
his
shoulder
and
he
hurried
forward
but
his
hope
soon
changed
to
bewilderment
and
alarm
the
dark
patches
grew
darker
but
they
shrank
and
suddenly
he
saw
towering
ominous
before
him
and
leaning
slightly
towards
one
another
like
the
pillars
of
a
headless
door
two
huge
standing
stones
he
could
not
remember
having
seen
any
sign
of
these
in
the
valley
when
he
looked
out
from
the
hill
in
the
morning
he
had
passed
between
them
almost
before
he
was
aware
and
even
as
he
did
so
darkness
seemed
to
fall
round
him
his
pony
reared
and
snorted
and
he
fell
off
when
he
looked
back
he
found
that
he
was
alone
the
others
had
not
followed
him
'sam'
he
called
'pippin
merry
come
along
why
don't
you
keep
up'

there
was
no
answer
fear
took
him
and
he
ran
back
past
the
stones
shouting
wildly
'sam
sam
merry
pippin'
the
pony
bolted
into
the
mist
and
vanished
from
some
way
off
or
so
it
seemed
he
thought
he
heard
a
cry
'hoy
frodo
hoy'
it
was
away
eastward
on
his
left
as
he
stood
under
the
great
stones
staring
and
straining
into
the
gloom
he
plunged
off
in
the
direction
of
the
call
and
found
himself
going
steeply
uphill

as
he
struggled
on
he
called
again
and
kept
on
calling
more
and
more
frantically
but
he
heard
no
answer
for
some
time
and
then
it
seemed
faint
and
far
ahead
and
high
above
him
'frodo
hoy'
came
the
thin
voices
out
of
the
mist
and
then
a
cry
that
sounded
like

help
help

often
repeated
ending
with
a
last

help

that
trailed
off
into
a
long
wail
suddenly
cut
short
he
stumbled
forward
with
all
the
speed
he
could
towards
the
cries
but
the
light
was
now
gone
and
clinging
night
had
closed
about
him
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
sure
of
any
direction
he
seemed
all
the
time
to
be
climbing
up
and
up

only
the
change
in
the
level
of
the
ground
at
his
feet
told
him
when
he
at
last
came
to
the
top
of
a
ridge
or
hill
he
was
weary
sweating
and
yet
chilled
it
was
wholly
dark

'where
are
you'
he
cried
out
miserably

there
was
no
reply
he
stood
listening
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
it
was
getting
very
cold
and
that
up
here
a
wind
was
beginning
to
blow
an
icy
wind
a
change
was
coming
in
the
weather
the
mist
was
flowing
past
him
now
in
shreds
and
tatters
his
breath
was
smoking
and
the
darkness
was
less
near
and
thick
he
looked
up
and
saw
with
surprise
that
faint
stars
were
appearing
overhead
amid
the
strands
of
hurrying
cloud
and
fog
the
wind
began
to
hiss
over
the
grass

he
imagined
suddenly
that
he
caught
a
muffled
cry
and
he
made
towards
it
and
even
as
he
went
forward
the
mist
was
rolled
up
and
thrust
aside
and
the
starry
sky
was
unveiled
a
glance
showed
him
that
he
was
now
facing
southwards
and
was
on
a
round
hilltop
which
he
must
have
climbed
from
the
north
out
of
the
east
the
biting
wind
was
blowing
to
his
right
there
loomed
against
the
westward
stars
a
dark
black
shape
a
great
barrow
stood
there

'where
are
you'
he
cried
again
both
angry
and
afraid

'here'
said
a
voice
deep
and
cold
that
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
ground
'i
am
waiting
for
you'

'no'
said
frodo
but
he
did
not
run
away
his
knees
gave
and
he
fell
on
the
ground
nothing
happened
and
there
was
no
sound
trembling
he
looked
up
in
time
to
see
a
tall
dark
figure
like
a
shadow
against
the
stars
it
leaned
over
him
he
thought
there
were
two
eyes
very
cold
though
lit
with
a
pale
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
some
remote
distance
then
a
grip
stronger
and
colder
than
iron
seized
him
the
icy
touch
froze
his
bones
and
he
remembered
no
more


when
he
came
to
himself
again
for
a
moment
he
could
recall
nothing
except
a
sense
of
dread
then
suddenly
he
knew
that
he
was
imprisoned
caught
hopelessly
he
was
in
a
barrow
a
barrowwight
had
taken
him
and
he
was
probably
already
under
the
dreadful
spells
of
the
barrowwights
about
which
whispered
tales
spoke
he
dared
not
move
but
lay
as
he
found
himself
flat
on
his
back
upon
a
cold
stone
with
his
hands
on
his
breast

but
though
his
fear
was
so
great
that
it
seemed
to
be
part
of
the
very
darkness
that
was
round
him
he
found
himself
as
he
lay
thinking
about
bilbo
baggins
and
his
stories
of
their
jogging
along
together
in
the
lanes
of
the
shire
and
talking
about
roads
and
adventures
there
is
a
seed
of
courage
hidden
often
deeply
it
is
true
in
the
heart
of
the
fattest
and
most
timid
hobbit
wailing
for
some
final
and
desperate
danger
to
make
it
grow
frodo
was
neither
very
fat
nor
very
timid
indeed
though
he
did
not
know
it
bilbo
and
gandalf
had
thought
him
the
best
hobbit
in
the
shire
he
thought
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
adventure
and
a
terrible
end
but
the
thought
hardened
him
he
found
himself
stiffening
as
if
for
a
final
spring
he
no
longer
felt
limp
like
a
helpless
prey

as
he
lay
there
thinking
and
getting
a
hold
of
himself
he
noticed
all
at
once
that
the
darkness
was
slowly
giving
way
a
pale
greenish
light
was
growing
round
him
it
did
not
at
first
show
him
what
kind
of
a
place
he
was
in
for
the
light
seemed
to
be
coming
out
of
himself
and
from
the
floor
beside
him
and
had
not
yet
reached
the
roof
or
wall
he
turned
and
there
in
the
cold
glow
he
saw
lying
beside
him
sam
pippin
and
merry
they
were
on
their
backs
and
their
faces
looked
deathly
pale
and
they
were
clad
in
white
about
them
lay
many
treasures
of
gold
maybe
though
in
that
light
they
looked
cold
and
unlovely
on
their
heads
were
circlets
gold
chains
were
about
their
waists
and
on
their
fingers
were
many
rings
swords
lay
by
their
sides
and
shields
were
at
their
feet
but
across
their
three
necks
lay
one
long
naked
sword

suddenly
a
song
began
a
cold
murmur
rising
and
falling
the
voice
seemed
far
away
and
immeasurably
dreary
sometimes
high
in
the
air
and
thin
sometimes
like
a
low
moan
from
the
ground
out
of
the
formless
stream
of
sad
but
horrible
sounds
strings
of
words
would
now
and
again
shape
themselves
grim
hard
cold
words
heartless
and
miserable
the
night
was
railing
against
the
morning
of
which
it
was
bereaved
and
the
cold
was
cursing
the
warmth
for
which
it
hungered
frodo
was
chilled
to
the
marrow
after
a
while
the
song
became
clearer
and
with
dread
in
his
heart
he
perceived
that
it
had
changed
into
an
incantation

cold
be
hand
and
heart
and
bone

and
cold
be
sleep
under
stone

never
mare
to
wake
on
stony
bed

never
till
the
sun
fails
and
the
moon
is
dead

in
the
black
wind
the
stars
shall
die

and
still
on
gold
here
let
them
lie

till
the
dark
lord
lifts
his
hand

over
dead
sea
and
withered
land


he
heard
behind
his
head
a
creaking
and
scraping
sound
raising
himself
on
one
arm
he
looked
and
saw
now
in
the
pale
light
that
they
were
in
a
kind
of
passage
which
behind
them
turned
a
corner
round
the
corner
a
long
arm
was
groping
walking
on
its
fingers
towards
sam
who
was
lying
nearest
and
towards
the
hilt
of
the
sword
that
lay
upon
him

at
first
frodo
felt
as
if
he
had
indeed
been
turned
into
stone
by
the
incantation
then
a
wild
thought
of
escape
came
to
him
he
wondered
if
he
put
on
the
ring
whether
the
barrowwight
would
miss
him
and
he
might
find
some
way
out
he
thought
of
himself
running
free
over
the
grass
grieving
for
merry
and
sam
and
pippin
but
free
and
alive
himself
gandalf
would
admit
that
there
had
been
nothing
else
he
could
do

but
the
courage
that
had
been
awakened
in
him
was
now
too
strong
he
could
not
leave
his
friends
so
easily
he
wavered
groping
in
his
pocket
and
then
fought
with
himself
again
and
as
he
did
so
the
arm
crept
nearer
suddenly
resolve
hardened
in
him
and
he
seized
a
short
sword
that
lay
beside
him
and
kneeling
he
stooped
low
over
the
bodies
of
his
companions
with
what
strength
he
had
he
hewed
at
the
crawling
arm
near
the
wrist
and
the
hand
broke
off
but
at
the
same
moment
the
sword
splintered
up
to
the
hilt
there
was
a
shriek
and
the
light
vanished
in
the
dark
there
was
a
snarling
noise

frodo
fell
forward
over
merry
and
merry's
face
felt
cold
all
at
once
back
into
his
mind
from
which
it
had
disappeared
with
the
first
coming
of
the
fog
came
the
memory
of
the
house
down
under
the
hill
and
of
tom
singing
he
remembered
the
rhyme
that
tom
had
taught
them
in
a
small
desperate
voice
he
began

ho
tom
bombadil

and
with
that
name
his
voice
seemed
to
grow
strong
it
had
a
full
and
lively
sound
and
the
dark
chamber
echoed
as
if
to
drum
and
trumpet

ho
tom
bombadil
tom
bombadillo

by
water
wood
and
hill
by
the
reed
and
willow

by
fire
sun
and
moon
harken
now
and
hear
us

come
tom
bombadil
for
our
need
is
near
us


there
was
a
sudden
deep
silence
in
which
frodo
could
hear
his
heart
beating
after
a
long
slow
moment
he
heard
plain
but
far
away
as
if
it
was
coming
down
through
the
ground
or
through
thick
walls
an
answering
voice
singing

old
tom
bombadil
is
a
merry
fellow

bright
blue
his
jacket
is
and
his
boots
are
yellow

none
has
ever
caught
him
yet
for
tom
he
is
the
master

his
songs
are
stronger
songs
and
his
feet
are
faster

there
was
a
loud
rumbling
sound
as
of
stones
rolling
and
falling
and
suddenly
light
streamed
in
real
light
the
plain
light
of
day
a
low
doorlike
opening
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
chamber
beyond
frodo's
feet
and
there
was
tom's
head
hat
feather
and
all
framed
against
the
light
of
the
sun
rising
red
behind
him
the
light
fell
upon
the
floor
and
upon
the
faces
of
the
three
hobbits
lying
beside
frodo
they
did
not
stir
but
the
sickly
hue
had
left
them
they
looked
now
as
if
they
were
only
very
deeply
asleep

tom
stooped
removed
his
hat
and
came
into
the
dark
chamber
singing

get
out
you
old
wight
vanish
in
the
sunlight

shrivel
like
the
cold
mist
like
the
winds
go
wailing

out
into
the
barren
lands
far
beyond
the
mountains

come
never
here
again
leave
your
barrow
empty

lost
and
forgotten
be
darker
than
the
darkness

where
gates
stand
for
ever
shut
till
the
world
is
mended


at
these
words
there
was
a
cry
and
part
of
the
inner
end
of
the
chamber
fell
in
with
a
crash
then
there
was
a
long
trailing
shriek
fading
away
into
an
unguessable
distance
and
after
that
silence

'come
friend
frodo'
said
tom
'let
us
get
out
on
to
clean
grass
you
must
help
me
bear
them'

together
they
carried
out
merry
pippin
and
sam
as
frodo
left
the
barrow
for
the
last
time
he
thought
he
saw
a
severed
hand
wriggling
still
like
a
wounded
spider
in
a
heap
of
fallen
earth
tom
went
back
in
again
and
there
was
a
sound
of
much
thumping
and
stamping
when
he
came
out
he
was
bearing
in
his
arms
a
great
load
of
treasure
things
of
gold
silver
copper
and
bronze
many
beads
and
chains
and
jewelled
ornaments
he
climbed
the
green
barrow
and
laid
them
all
on
top
in
the
sunshine


there
he
stood
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
wind
in
his
hair
and
looked
down
upon
the
three
hobbits
that
had
been
laid
on
their
backs
upon
the
grass
at
the
west
side
of
the
mound
raising
his
right
hand
he
said
in
a
clear
and
commanding
voice

wake
now
my
merry
tads
wake
and
hear
me
calling

warm
now
be
heart
and
limb
the
cold
stone
is
fallen

dark
door
is
standing
wide
dead
hand
is
broken

night
under
night
is
flown
and
the
gate
is
open

to
frodo's
great
joy
the
hobbits
stirred
stretched
their
arms
rubbed
their
eyes
and
then
suddenly
sprang
up
they
looked
about
in
amazement
first
at
frodo
and
then
at
tom
standing
large
as
life
on
the
barrowtop
above
them
and
then
at
themselves
in
their
thin
white
rags
crowned
and
belted
with
pale
gold
and
jingling
with
trinkets

'what
in
the
name
of
wonder'
began
merry
feeling
the
golden
circlet
that
had
slipped
over
one
eye
then
he
stopped
and
a
shadow
came
over
his
face
and
he
closed
his
eyes
'of
course
I
remember'
he
said
'the
men
of
carn
dm
came
on
us
at
night
and
we
were
worsted
ah
the
spear
in
my
heart'
he
clutched
at
his
breast
'no
no'
he
said
opening
his
eyes
'what
am
I
saying
I
have
been
dreaming
where
did
you
get
to
frodo'

'i
thought
that
I
was
lost'
said
frodo
'but
I
don't
want
to
speak
of
it
let
us
think
of
what
we
are
to
do
now
let
us
go
on'

'dressed
up
like
this
sir'
said
sam
'where
are
my
clothes'
he
flung
his
circlet
belt
and
rings
on
the
grass
and
looked
round
helplessly
as
if
he
expected
to
find
his
cloak
jacket
and
breeches
and
other
hobbitgarments
lying
somewhere
to
hand

'you
won't
find
your
clothes
again'
said
tom
bounding
down
from
the
mound
and
laughing
as
he
danced
round
them
in
the
sunlight
one
would
have
thought
that
nothing
dangerous
or
dreadful
had
happened
and
indeed
the
horror
faded
out
of
their
hearts
as
they
looked
at
him
and
saw
the
merry
glint
in
his
eyes

'what
do
you
mean'
asked
pippin
looking
at
him
half
puzzled
and
half
amused
'why
not'

but
tom
shook
his
head
saying
'you've
found
yourselves
again
out
of
the
deep
water
clothes
are
but
little
loss
if
you
escape
from
drowning
be
glad
my
merry
friends
and
let
the
warm
sunlight
heal
now
heart
and
limb
cast
off
these
cold
rags
run
naked
on
the
grass
while
tom
goes
ahunting'

he
sprang
away
down
hill
whistling
and
calling
looking
down
after
him
frodo
saw
him
running
away
southwards
along
the
green
hollow
between
their
hill
and
the
next
still
whistling
and
crying

hey
now
come
hoy
now
whither
do
you
wander

up
down
near
or
far
here
there
or
yonder

sharpears
wisenose
swishtail
and
bumpkin

whitesocks
my
little
lad
and
old
fatty
lumpkin

so
he
sang
running
fast
tossing
up
his
hat
and
catching
it
until
he
was
hidden
by
a
fold
of
the
ground
but
for
some
time
his

hey
now
hoy
now
came
floating
back
down
the
wind
which
had
shifted
round
towards
the
south

the
air
was
growing
very
warm
again
the
hobbits
ran
about
for
a
while
on
the
grass
as
he
told
them
then
they
lay
basking
in
the
sun
with
the
delight
of
those
that
have
been
wafted
suddenly
from
bitter
winter
to
a
friendly
clime
or
of
people
that
after
being
long
ill
and
bedridden
wake
one
day
to
find
that
they
are
unexpectedly
well
and
the
day
is
again
full
of
promise

by
the
time
that
tom
returned
they
were
feeling
strong
and
hungry
he
reappeared
hat
first
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
behind
him
came
in
an
obedient
line

six

ponies
their
own
five
and
one
more
the
last
was
plainly
old
fatty
lumpkin
he
was
larger
stronger
fatter
and
older
than
their
own
ponies
merry
to
whom
the
others
belonged
had
not
in
fact
given
them
any
such
names
but
they
answered
to
the
new
names
that
tom
had
given
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
tom
called
them
one
by
one
and
they
climbed
over
the
brow
and
stood
in
a
line
then
tom
bowed
to
the
hobbits

'here
are
your
ponies
now'
he
said
'they've
more
sense
in
some
ways
than
you
wandering
hobbits
have

more
sense
in
their
noses
for
they
sniff
danger
ahead
which
you
walk
right
into
and
if
they
run
to
save
themselves
then
they
run
the
right
way
you
must
forgive
them
all
for
though
their
hearts
are
faithful
to
face
fear
of
barrowwights
is
not
what
they
were
made
for
see
here
they
come
again
bringing
all
their
burdens'

merry
sam
and
pippin
now
clothed
themselves
in
spare
garments
from
their
packs
and
they
soon
felt
too
hot
for
they
were
obliged
to
put
on
some
of
the
thicker
and
warmer
things
that
they
had
brought
against
the
oncoming
of
winter

'where
does
that
other
old
animal
that
fatty
lumpkin
come
from'
asked
frodo

'he's
mine'
said
tom
'my
fourlegged
friend
though
I
seldom
ride
him
and
he
wanders
often
far
free
upon
the
hillsides
when
your
ponies
stayed
with
me
they
got
to
know
my
lumpkin
and
they
smelt
him
in
the
night
and
quickly
ran
to
meet
him
I
thought
he'd
look
for
them
and
with
his
words
of
wisdom
take
all
their
fear
away
but
now
my
jolly
lumpkin
old
tom's
going
to
ride
hey
he's
coming
with
you
just
to
set
you
on
the
road
so
he
needs
a
pony
for
you
cannot
easily
talk
to
hobbits
that
are
riding
when
you're
on
your
own
legs
trying
to
trot
beside
them'

the
hobbits
were
delighted
to
hear
this
and
thanked
tom
many
times
but
he
laughed
and
said
that
they
were
so
good
at
losing
themselves
that
he
would
not
feel
happy
till
he
had
seen
them
safe
over
the
borders
of
his
land
'i've
got
things
to
do'
he
said
'my
making
and
my
singing
my
talking
and
my
walking
and
my
watching
of
the
country
tom
can't
be
always
near
to
open
doors
and
willowcracks
tom
has
his
house
to
mind
and
goldberry
is
waiting'

it
was
still
fairly
early
by
the
sun
something
between
nine
and
ten
and
the
hobbits
turned
their
minds
to
food
their
last
meal
had
been
lunch
beside
the
standing
stone
the
day
before
they
breakfasted
now
off
the
remainder
of
tom's
provisions
meant
for
their
supper
with
additions
that
tom
had
brought
with
him
it
was
not
a
large
meal
considering
hobbits
and
the
circumstances
but
they
felt
much
better
for
it
while
they
were
eating
tom
went
up
to
the
mound
and
looked
through
the
treasures
most
of
these
he
made
into
a
pile
that
glistened
and
sparkled
on
the
grass
he
bade
them
lie
there
'free
to
all
finders
birds
beasts
elves
or
men
and
all
kindly
creatures'
for
so
the
spell
of
the
mound
should
be
broken
and
scattered
and
no
wight
ever
come
back
to
it
he
chose
for
himself
from
the
pile
a
brooch
set
with
blue
stones
manyshaded
like
flaxflowers
or
the
wings
of
blue
butterflies
he
looked
long
at
it
as
if
stirred
by
some
memory
shaking
his
head
and
saying
at
last

'here
is
a
pretty
toy
for
tom
and
for
his
lady
fair
was
she
who
long
ago
wore
this
on
her
shoulder
goldberry
shall
wear
it
now
and
we
will
not
forget
her'

for
each
of
the
hobbits
he
chose
a
dagger
long
leafshaped
and
keen
of
marvellous
workmanship
damasked
with
serpentforms
in
red
and
gold
they
gleamed
as
he
drew
them
from
their
black
sheaths
wrought
of
some
strange
metal
light
and
strong
and
set
with
many
fiery
stones
whether
by
some
virtue
in
these
sheaths
or
because
of
the
spell
that
lay
on
the
mound
the
blades
seemed
untouched
by
time
unrusted
sharp
glittering
in
the
sun

'old
knives
are
long
enough
as
swords
for
hobbitpeople'
he
said
'sharp
blades
are
good
to
have
if
shirefolk
go
walking
east
south
or
far
away
into
dark
and
danger'
then
he
told
them
that
these
blades
were
forged
many
long
years
ago
by
men
of
westernesse
they
were
foes
of
the
dark
lord
but
they
were
overcome
by
the
evil
king
of
carn
dm
in
the
land
of
angmar

'few
now
remember
them'
tom
murmured
'yet
still
some
go
wandering
sons
of
forgotten
kings
walking
in
loneliness
guarding
from
evil
things
folk
that
are
heedless'


the
hobbits
did
not
understand
his
words
but
as
he
spoke
they
had
a
vision
as
it
were
of
a
great
expanse
of
years
behind
them
like
a
vast
shadowy
plain
over
which
there
strode
shapes
of
men
tall
and
grim
with
bright
swords
and
last
came
one
with
a
star
on
his
brow
then
the
vision
faded
and
they
were
back
in
the
sunlit
world
it
was
time
to
start
again
they
made
ready
packing
their
bags
and
lading
their
ponies
their
new
weapons
they
hung
on
their
leather
belts
under
their
jackets
feeling
them
very
awkward
and
wondering
if
they
would
be
of
any
use
fighting
had
not
before
occurred
to
any
of
them
as
one
of
the
adventures
in
which
their
flight
would
land
them

at
last
they
set
off
they
led
their
ponies
down
the
hill
and
then
mounting
they
trotted
quickly
along
the
valley
they
looked
back
and
saw
the
top
of
the
old
mound
on
the
hill
and
from
it
the
sunlight
on
the
gold
went
up
like
a
yellow
flame
then
they
turned
a
shoulder
of
the
downs
and
it
was
hidden
from
view

though
frodo
looked
about
him
on
every
side
he
saw
no
sign
of
the
great
stones
standing
like
a
gate
and
before
long
they
came
to
the
northern
gap
and
rode
swiftly
through
and
the
land
fell
away
before
them
it
was
a
merry
journey
with
tom
bombadil
trotting
gaily
beside
them
or
before
them
on
fatty
lumpkin
who
could
move
much
faster
than
his
girth
promised
tom
sang
most
of
the
time
but
it
was
chiefly
nonsense
or
else
perhaps
a
strange
language
unknown
to
the
hobbits
an
ancient
language
whose
words
were
mainly
those
of
wonder
and
delight

they
went
forward
steadily
but
they
soon
saw
that
the
road
was
further
away
than
they
had
imagined
even
without
a
fog
their
sleep
at
midday
would
have
prevented
them
from
reaching
it
until
after
nightfall
on
the
day
before
the
dark
line
they
had
seen
was
not
a
line
of
trees
but
a
line
of
bushes
growing
on
the
edge
of
a
deep
dike
with
a
steep
wall
on
the
further
side
tom
said
that
it
had
once
been
the
boundary
of
a
kingdom
but
a
very
long
lime
ago
he
seemed
to
remember
something
sad
about
it
and
would
not
say
much

they
climbed
down
and
out
of
the
dike
and
through
a
gap
in
the
wall
and
then
tom
turned
due
north
for
they
had
been
bearing
somewhat
to
the
west
the
land
was
now
open
and
fairly
level
and
they
quickened
their
pace
but
the
sun
was
already
sinking
low
when
at
last
they
saw
a
line
of
tall
trees
ahead
and
they
knew
that
they
had
come
back
to
the
road
after
many
unexpected
adventures
they
galloped
their
ponies
over
the
last
furlongs
and
halted
under
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
they
were
on
the
top
of
a
sloping
bank
and
the
road
now
dim
as
evening
drew
on
wound
away
below
them
at
this
point
it
ran
nearly
from
southwest
to
northeast
and
on
their
right
it
fell
quickly
down
into
a
wide
hollow
it
was
rutted
and
bore
many
signs
of
the
recent
heavy
rain
there
were
pools
and
potholes
full
of
water
they
rode
down
the
bank
and
looked
up
and
down
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
'well
here
we
are
again
at
last'
said
frodo
'i
suppose
we
haven't
lost
more
than
two
days
by
my
short
cut
through
the
forest
but
perhaps
the
delay
will
prove
useful

it
may
have
put
them
off
our
trail'

the
others
looked
at
him
the
shadow
of
the
fear
of
the
black
riders
came
suddenly
over
them
again
ever
since
they
had
entered
the
forest
they
had
thought
chiefly
of
getting
back
to
the
road
only
now
when
it
lay
beneath
their
feet
did
they
remember
the
danger
which
pursued
them
and
was
more
than
likely
to
be
lying
in
wait
for
them
upon
the
road
itself
they
looked
anxiously
back
towards
the
setting
sun
but
the
road
was
brown
and
empty

'do
you
think'
asked
pippin
hesitatingly
'do
you
think
we
may
be
pursued
tonight'

'no
I
hope
not
tonight'
answered
tom
bombadil
'nor
perhaps
the
next
day
but
do
not
trust
my
guess
for
I
cannot
tell
for
certain
out
east
my
knowledge
fails
tom
is
not
master
of
riders
from
the
black
land
far
beyond
his
country'

all
the
same
the
hobbits
wished
he
was
coming
with
them
they
felt
that
he
would
know
how
to
deal
with
black
riders
if
anyone
did
they
would
soon
now
be
going
forward
into
lands
wholly
strange
to
them
and
beyond
all
but
the
most
vague
and
distant
legends
of
the
shire
and
in
the
gathering
twilight
they
longed
for
home
a
deep
loneliness
and
sense
of
loss
was
on
them
they
stood
silent
reluctant
to
make
the
final
parting
and
only
slowly
became
aware
that
tom
was
wishing
them
farewell
and
telling
them
to
have
good
heart
and
to
ride
on
till
dark
without
halting


'tom
will
give
you
good
advice
till
this
day
is
over
after
that
your
own
luck
must
go
with
you
and
guide
you
four
miles
along
the
road
you'll
come
upon
a
village
bree
under
breehill
with
doors
looking
westward
there
you'll
find
an
old
inn
that
is
called

the
prancing
pony

barliman
butterbur
is
the
worthy
keeper
there
you
can
stay
the
night
and
afterwards
the
morning
will
speed
you
upon
your
way
be
bold
but
wary
keep
up
your
merry
hearts
and
ride
to
meet
your
fortune'

they
begged
him
to
come
at
least
as
far
as
the
inn
and
drink
once
more
with
them
but
he
laughed
and
refused
saying

tom's
country
ends
here
he
will
not
pass
the
borders

tom
has
his
house
to
mind
and
goldberry
is
waiting

then
he
turned
tossed
up
his
hat
leaped
on
lumpkin's
back
and
rode
up
over
the
bank
and
away
singing
into
the
dusk

the
hobbits
climbed
up
and
watched
him
until
he
was
out
of
sight

'i
am
sorry
to
take
leave
of
master
bombadil'
said
sam
'he's
a
caution
and
no
mistake
I
reckon
we
may
go
a
good
deal
further
and
see
naught
better
nor
queerer
but
I
won't
deny
i'll
be
glad
to
see
this

prancing
pony
he
spoke
of
I
hope
it'll
be
like

the
green
dragon

away
back
home
what
sort
of
folk
are
they
in
bree'

'there
are
hobbits
in
bree'
said
merry
'as
well
as
big
folk
I
daresay
it
will
be
homelike
enough

the
pony

is
a
good
inn
by
all
accounts
my
people
ride
out
there
now
and
again'

'it
may
be
all
we
could
wish'
said
frodo
'but
it
is
outside
the
shire
all
the
same
don't
make
yourselves
too
much
at
home
please
remember
all
of
you

that
the
name
of
baggins
must
not
be
mentioned
I
am
mr
underhill
if
any
name
must
be
given'

they
now
mounted
their
ponies
and
rode
off
silently
into
the
evening
darkness
came
down
quickly
as
they
plodded
slowly
downhill
and
up
again
until
at
last
they
saw
lights
twinkling
some
distance
ahead

before
them
rose
breehill
barring
the
way
a
dark
mass
against
misty
stars
and
under
its
western
flank
nestled
a
large
village
towards
it
they
now
hurried
desiring
only
to
find
a
fire
and
a
door
between
them
and
the
night


chapter
9

at
the
sign
of
the
prancing
pony


bree
was
the
chief
village
of
the
breeland
a
small
inhabited
region
like
an
island
in
the
empty
lands
round
about
besides
bree
itself
there
was
staddle
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
combe
in
a
deep
valley
a
little
further
eastward
and
archet
on
the
edge
of
the
chetwood
lying
round
breehill
and
the
villages
was
a
small
country
of
fields
and
tamed
woodland
only
a
few
miles
broad

the
men
of
bree
were
brownhaired
broad
and
rather
short
cheerful
and
independent
they
belonged
to
nobody
but
themselves
but
they
were
more
friendly
and
familiar
with
hobbits
dwarves
elves
and
other
inhabitants
of
the
world
about
them
than
was
or
is
usual
with
big
people
according
to
their
own
tales
they
were
the
original
inhabitants
and
were
the
descendants
of
the
first
men
that
ever
wandered
into
the
west
of
the
middleworld
few
had
survived
the
turmoils
of
the
elder
days
but
when
the
kings
returned
again
over
the
great
sea
they
had
found
the
breemen
still
there
and
they
were
still
there
now
when
the
memory
of
the
old
kings
had
faded
into
the
grass

in
those
days
no
other
men
had
settled
dwellings
so
far
west
or
within
a
hundred
leagues
of
the
shire
but
in
the
wild
lands
beyond
bree
there
were
mysterious
wanderers
the
breefolk
called
them
rangers
and
knew
nothing
of
their
origin
they
were
taller
and
darker
than
the
men
of
bree
and
were
believed
to
have
strange
powers
of
sight
and
hearing
and
to
understand
the
languages
of
beasts
and
birds
they
roamed
at
will
southwards
and
eastwards
even
as
far
as
the
misty
mountains
but
they
were
now
few
and
rarely
seen
when
they
appeared
they
brought
news
from
afar
and
told
strange
forgotten
tales
which
were
eagerly
listened
to
but
the
breefolk
did
not
make
friends
of
them

there
were
also
many
families
of
hobbits
in
the
breeland
and

they
claimed
to
be
the
oldest
settlement
of
hobbits
in
the
world
one
that
was
founded
long
before
even
the
brandywine
was
crossed
and
the
shire
colonized
they
lived
mostly
in
staddle
though
there
were
some
in
bree
itself
especially
on
the
higher
slopes
of
the
hill
above
the
houses
of
the
men
the
big
folk
and
the
little
folk
as
they
called
one
another
were
on
friendly
terms
minding
their
own
affairs
in
their
own
ways
but
both
rightly
regarding
themselves
as
necessary
parts
of
the
breefolk
nowhere
else
in
the
world
was
this
peculiar
but
excellent
arrangement
to
be
found

the
breefolk
big
and
little
did
not
themselves
travel
much
and
the
affairs
of
the
four
villages
were
their
chief
concern
occasionally
the
hobbits
of
bree
went
as
far
as
buckland
or
the
eastfarthing
but
though
their
link
land
was
not
much
further
than
a
day's
riding
east
of
the
brandywine
bridge
the
hobbits
of
the
shire
now
seldom
visited
it
an
occasional
bucklander
or
adventurous
took
would
come
out
to
the
inn
for
a
night
or
two
but
even
that
was
becoming
less
and
less
usual
the
shirehobbits
referred
to
those
of
bree
and
to
any
others
that
lived
beyond
the
borders
as
outsiders
and
took
very
little
interest
in
them
considering
them
dull
and
uncouth
there
were
probably
many
more
outsiders
scattered
about
in
the
west
of
the
world
in
those
days
than
the
people
of
the
shire
imagined
some
doubtless
were
no
better
than
tramps
ready
to
dig
a
hole
in
any
bank
and
stay
only
as
long
as
it
suited
them
but
in
the
breeland
at
any
rate
the
hobbits
were
decent
and
prosperous
and
no
more
rustic
than
most
of
their
distant
relatives
inside
it
was
not
yet
forgotten
that
there
had
been
a
time
when
there
was
much
coming
and
going
between
the
shire
and
bree
there
was
breeblood
in
the
brandybucks
by
all
accounts

the
village
of
bree
had
some
hundred
stone
houses
of
the
big
folk
mostly
above
the
road
nestling
on
the
hillside
with
windows
looking
west
on
that
side
running
in
more
than
half
a
circle
from
the
hill
and
back
to
it
there
was
a
deep
dike
with
a
thick
hedge
on
the
inner
side
over
this
the
road
crossed
by
a
causeway
but
where
it
pierced
the
hedge
it
was
barred
by
a
great
gate
there
was
another
gate
in
the
southern
comer
where
the
road
ran
out
of
the
village
the
gates
were
closed
at
nightfall
but
just
inside
them
were
small
lodges
for
the
gatekeepers

down
on
the
road
where
it
swept
to
the
right
to
go
round
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
was
a
large
inn
it
had
been
built
long
ago
when
the
traffic
on
the
roads
had
been
far
greater
for
bree
stood
at
an
old
meeting
of
ways
another
ancient
road
crossed
the
east
road
just
outside
he
dike
at
the
western
end
of
the
village
and
in
former
days
men
and
other
folk
of
various
sorts
had
travelled
much
on
it

strange
as
news
from
bree

was
still
a
saying
in
the
eastfarthing
descending
from
those
days
when
news
from
north
south
and
east
could
be
heard
in
the
inn
and
when
the
shirehobbits
used
to
go
more
often
to
hear
it
but
the
northern
lands
had
long
been
desolate
and
the
north
road
was
now
seldom
used
it
was
grassgrown
and
the
breefolk
called
it
the
greenway

the
inn
of
bree
was
still
there
however
and
the
innkeeper
was
an
important
person
his
house
was
a
meeting
place
for
the
idle
talkative
and
inquisitive
among
the
inhabitants
large
and
small
of
the
four
villages
and
a
resort
of
rangers
and
other
wanderers
and
for
such
travellers
mostly
dwarves
as
still
journeyed
on
the
east
road
to
and
from
the
mountains

it
was
dark
and
white
stars
were
shining
when
frodo
and
his
companions
came
at
last
to
the
greenwaycrossing
and
drew
near
the
village
they
came
to
the
westgate
and
found
it
shut
but
at
the
door
of
the
lodge
beyond
it
there
was
a
man
sitting
he
jumped
up
and
fetched
a
lantern
and
looked
over
the
gate
at
them
in
surprise

'what
do
you
want
and
where
do
you
come
from'
he
asked
gruffly


'we
are
making
for
the
inn
here'
answered
frodo
'we
are
journeying
east
and
cannot
go
further
tonight'

'hobbits
four
hobbits
and
what's
more
out
of
the
shire
by
their
talk'
said
the
gatekeeper
softly
as
if
speaking
to
himself
he
stared
at
them
darkly
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
opened
the
gate
and
let
them
ride
through

'we
don't
often
see
shirefolk
riding
on
the
road
at
night'
he
went
on
as
they
halted
a
moment
by
his
door
'you'll
pardon
my
wondering
what
business
takes
you
away
east
of
bree
what
may
your
names
be
might
I
ask'

'our
names
and
our
business
are
our
own
and
this
does
not
seem
a
good
place
to
discuss
them'
said
frodo
not
liking
the
look
of
the
man
or
the
tone
of
his
voice

'your
business
is
your
own
no
doubt'
said
the
man
'but
it's
my
business
to
ask
questions
after
nightfall'

'we
are
hobbits
from
buckland
and
we
have
a
fancy
to
travel
and
to
stay
at
the
inn
here'
put
in
merry
'i
am
mr
brandybuck
is
that
enough
for
you
the
breefolk
used
to
be
fairspoken
to
travellers
or
so
I
had
heard'

'all
right
all
right'
said
the
man
'i
meant
no
offence
but
you'll
find
maybe
that
more
folk
than
old
harry
at
the
gate
will
be
asking
you
questions
there's
queer
folk
about
if
you
go
on
to

the
pony

you'll
find
you're
oat
the
only
guests'

he
wished
them
good
night
and
they
said
no
more
but
frodo
could
see
in
the
lanternlight
that
the
man
was
still
eyeing
them
curiously
he
was
glad
to
hear
the
gate
clang
to
behind
them
as
they
rode
forward
he
wondered
why
the
man
was
so
suspicious
and
whether
any
one
had
been
asking
for

news
of

a
party
of
hobbits
could
it
have
been
gandalf
he
might
have
arrived
while
they
were
delayed
in
the
forest
and
the
downs
but
there
was
something
in
the
look
and
the
voice
of
the
gatekeeper
that
made
him
uneasy

the
man
stared
after
the
hobbits
for
a
moment
and
then
he
went
back
to
his
house
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
a
dark
figure
climbed
quickly
in
over
the
gate
and
melted
into
the
shadows
of
the
village
street

the
hobbits
rode
on
up
a
gentle
slope
passing
a
few
detached
houses
and
drew
up
outside
the
inn
the
houses
looked
large
and
strange
to
them
sam
stared
up
at
the
inn
with
its
three
storeys
and
many
windows
and
felt
his
heart
sink
he
had
imagined
himself
meeting
giants
taller
than
trees
and
other
creatures
even
more
terrifying
some
time
or
other
in
the
course
of
his
journey
but
at
the
moment
he
was
finding
his
first
sight
of
men
and
their
tall
houses
quite
enough
indeed
too
much
for
the
dark
end
of
a
tiring
day
he
pictured
black
horses
standing
all
saddled
in
the
shadows
of
the
innyard
and
black
riders
peering
out
of
dark
upper
windows

'we
surely
aren't
going
to
stay
here
for
the
night
are
we
sir'
he
exclaimed
'if
there
are
hobbitfolk
in
these
pans
why
don't
we
look
for
some
that
would
be
willing
to
take
us
in
it
would
be
more
homelike'

'what's
wrong
with
the
inn'
said
frodo
'tom
bombadil
recommended
it
I
expect
it's
homelike
enough
inside'

even
from
the
outside
the
inn
looked
a
pleasant
house
to
familiar
eyes
it
had
a
front
on
the
road
and
two
wings
running
back
on
land
partly
cut
out
of
the
lower
slopes
of
the
hill
so
that
at
the
rear
the
secondfloor
windows
were
level
with
the
ground
there
was
a
wide
arch
leading
to
a
courtyard
between
the
two
wings
and
on
the
left
under
the
arch
there
was
a
large
doorway
reached
by
a
few
broad
steps
the
door
was
open
and
light
streamed
out
of
it
above
the
arch
there
was
a
lamp
and
beneath
it
swung
a
large
signboard
a
fat
white
pony
reared
up
on
its
hind
legs
over
the
door
was
painted
in
white
letters
the
prancing
pony
by
barliman
butterbur
many
of
the
lower
windows
showed
lights
behind
thick
curtains

as
they
hesitated
outside
in
the
gloom
someone
began
singing
a
merry
song
inside
and
many
cheerful
voices
joined
loudly
in
the
chorus
they
listened
to
this
encouraging
sound
for
a
moment
and
then
got
off
their
ponies
the
song
ended
and
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
and
clapping


they
led
their
ponies
under
the
arch
and
leaving
them
standing
in
the
yard
they
climbed
up
the
steps
frodo
went
forward
and
nearly
bumped
into
a
short
fat
man
with
a
bald
head
and
a
red
face
he
had
a
white
apron
on
and
was
bustling
out
of
one
door
and
in
through
another
carrying
a
tray
laden
with
full
mugs

'can
we'
began
frodo

'half
a
minute
if
you
please'
shouted
the
man
over
his
shoulder
and
vanished
into
a
babel
of
voices
and
a
cloud
of
smoke
in
a
moment
he
was
out
again
wiping
his
hands
on
his
apron

'good
evening
little
master'
he
said
bending
down
'what
may
you
be
wanting'

'beds
for
four
and
stabling
for
five
ponies
if
that
can
be
managed
are
you
mr
butterbur'

'that's
right
barliman
is
my
name
barliman
butterbur
at
your
service
you're
from
the
shire
eh'
he
said
and
then
suddenly
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
if
trying
to
remember
something
'hobbits'
he
cried
'now
what
does
that
remind
me
of
might
I
ask
your
names
sir'

'mr
took
and
mr
brandybuck'
said
frodo
'and
this
is
sam
gamgee
my
name
is
underhill'

'there
now'
said
mr
butterbur
snapping
his
fingers
'it's
gone
again
but
it'll
come
back
when
I
have
time
to
think
i'm
run
off
my
feet
but
i'll
see
what
I
can
do
for
you
we
don't
often
get
a
party
out
of
the
shire
nowadays
and
I
should
be
sorry
not
to
make
you
welcome
but
there
is
such
a
crowd
already
in
the
house
tonight
as
there
hasn't
been
for
long
enough
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
we
say
in
bree

'hi
nob'
he
shouted
'where
are
you
you
woollyfooted
slowcoach
nob'

'coming
sir
coming'
a
cheerylooking
hobbit
bobbed
out
of
a
door
and
seeing
the
travellers
stopped
short
and
stared
at
them
with
great
interest

'where's
bob'
asked
the
landlord
'you
don't
know
well
find
him
double
sharp
I
haven't
got
six
legs
nor
six
eyes
neither
tell
bob
there's
five
ponies
that
have
to
be
stabled
he
must
find
room
somehow'
nob
trotted
off
with
a
grin
and
a
wink

'well
now
what
was
I
going
to
say'
said
mr
butterbur
tapping
his
forehead
'one
thing
drives
out
another
so
to
speak
i'm
that
busy
tonight
my
head
is
going
round
there's
a
party
that
came
up
the
greenway
from
down
south
last
night

and
that
was
strange
enough
to
begin
with
then
there's
a
travelling
company
of
dwarves
going
west
come
in
this
evening
and
now
there's
you
if
you
weren't
hobbits
I
doubt
if
we
could
house
you
but
we've
got
a
room
or
two
in
the
north
wing
that
were
made
special
for
hobbits
when
this
place
was
built
on
the
ground
floor
as
they
usually
prefer
round
windows
and
all
as
they
like
it
I
hope
you'll
be
comfortable
you'll
be
wanting
supper
I
don't
doubt
as
soon
as
may
be
this
way
now'

he
led
them
a
short
way
down
a
passage
and
opened
a
door
'here
is
a
nice
little
parlour'
he
said
'i
hope
it
will
suit
excuse
me
now
i'm
that
busy
no
time
for
talking
I
must
be
trotting
it's
hard
work
for
two
legs
but
I
don't
get
thinner
i'll
look
in
again
later
if
you
want
anything
ring
the
handbell
and
nob
will
come
if
he
don't
come
ring
and
shout'

off
he
went
at
last
and
left
them
feeling
rather
breathless
he
seemed
capable
of
an
endless
stream
of
talk
however
busy
he
might
be
they
found
themselves
in
a
small
and
cosy
room
there
was
a
bit
of
bright
fire
burning
on
the
hearth
and
in
front
of
it
were
some
low
and
comfortable
chairs
there
was
a
round
table
already
spread
with
a
white
cloth
and
on
it
was
a
large
handbell
but
nob
the
hobbit
servant
came
bustling
in
long
before
they
thought
of
ringing
he
brought
candles
and
a
tray
full
of
plates

'will
you
be
wanting
anything
to
drink
masters'
he
asked
'and
shall
I
show
you
the
bedrooms
while
your
supper
is
got
ready'

they
were
washed
and
in
the
middle
of
good
deep
mugs
of
beer
when
mr
butterbur
and
nob
came
in
again
in
a
twinkling
the
table
was
laid
there
was
hot
soup
cold
meats
a
blackberry
tart
new
loaves
slabs
of
butter
and
half
a
ripe
cheese
good
plain
food
as
good
as
the
shire
could
show
and
homelike
enough
to
dispel
the
last
of
sam's
misgivings
already
much
relieved
by
the
excellence
of
the
beer


the
landlord
hovered
round
for
a
link
and
then
prepared
to
leave
them
'i
don't
know
whether
you
would
care
to
join
the
company
when
you
have
supped'
he
said
standing
at
the
door
'perhaps
you
would
rather
go
to
your
beds
still
the
company
would
be
very
pleased
to
welcome
you


if
you
had
a
mind
we
don't
get
outsiders

travellers
from
the
shire
I
should
say
begging
your
pardon

often
and
we
like
to
hear
a
bit
of
news
or
any
story
or
song
you
may
have
in
mind
but
as
you
please
ring
the
bell
if
you
lack
anything'

so
refreshed
and
encouraged
did
they
feel
at
the
end
of
their
supper
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour's
steady
going
not
hindered
by
unnecessary
talk
that
frodo
pippin
and
sam
decided
to
join
the
company
merry
said
it
would
be
too
stuffy
'i
shall
sit
here
quietly
by
the
fire
for
a
bit
and
perhaps
go
out
later
for
a
sniff
of
the
air
mind
your
ps
and
qs
and
don't
forget
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
escaping
in
secret
and
are
still

on

the
highroad
and
not
very
far
from
the
shire'

'all
right'
said
pippin
'mind
yourself
don't
get
lost
and
don't
forget
that
it
is
safer
indoors'

the
company
was
in
the
big
commonroom
of
the
inn
the
gathering
was
large
and
mixed
as
frodo
discovered
when
his
eyes
got
used
to
the
light
this
came
chiefly
from
a
blazing
logfire
for
the
three
lamps
hanging
from
the
beams
were
dim
and
half
veiled
in
smoke
barliman
butterbur
was
standing
near
the
fire
talking
to
a
couple
of
dwarves
and
one
or
two
strangelooking
men
on
the
benches
were
various
folk
men
of
bree
a
collection
of
local
hobbits
sitting
chattering
together
a
few
more
dwarves
and
other
vague
figures
difficult
to
make
out
away
in
the
shadows
and
comers

as
soon
as
the
shirehobbits
entered
there
was
a
chorus
of
welcome
from
the
breelanders
the
strangers
especially
those
that
had
come
up
the
greenway
stared
at
them
curiously
the
landlord
introduced
the
newcomers
to
the
breefolk
so
quickly
that
though
they
caught
many
names
they
were
seldom
sure
who
the
names
belonged
to
the
men
of
bree
seemed
all
to
have
rather
botanical
and
to
the
shirefolk
rather
odd
names
like
rushlight
goatleaf
heathertoes
appledore
thistlewool
and
ferny
not
to
mention
butterbur
some
of
the
hobbits
had
similar
names
the
mugworts
for
instance
seemed
numerous
but
most
of
them
had
natural
names
such
as
banks
brockhouse
longholes
sandheaver
and
tunnelly
many
of
which
were
used
in
the
shire
there
were
several
underhills
from
saddle
and
as
they
could
not
imagine
sharing
a
name
without
being
related
they
took
frodo
to
their
hearts
as
a
longlost
cousin

the
breehobbits
were
in
fact
friendly
and
inquisitive
and
frodo
soon
found
that
some
explanation
of
what
he
was
doing
would
have
to
be
given
he
gave
out
that
he
was
interested
in
history
and
geography
at
which
there
was
much
wagging
of
heads
although
neither
of
these
words
were
much
used
in
the
breedialect
he
said
he
was
thinking
of
writing
a
book
at
which
there
was
silent
astonishment

and

that
he
and
his
friends
wanted
to
collect
information
about
hobbits
living
outside
the
shire
especially
in
the
eastern
lands

at
this
a
chorus
of
voices
broke
out
if
frodo
had
really
wanted
to
write
a
book
and
had
had
many
ears
he
would
have
learned
enough
for
several
chapters
in
a
few
minutes
and
if
that
was
not
enough
he
was
given
a
whole
list
of
names
beginning
with
'old
barliman
here'
to
whom
he
could
go
for
further
information
but
after
a
time
as
frodo
did
not
show
any

sign

of
writing
a
book
on
the
spot
the
hobbits
returned
to
their
questions
about
doings
in
the
shire
frodo
did
not
prove
very
communicative
and
he
soon
found
himself
sitting
alone
in
a
comer
listening
and
looking
around

the
men
and
dwarves
were
mostly
talking
of
distant
events
and
telling
flews
of
a
kind
that
was
becoming
only
too
familiar
there
was
trouble
away
in
the
south
and
it
seemed
that
the
men
who
had
come
up
the
greenway
were
on
the
move
looking
for
lands
where
they
could
find
some
peace
the
breefolk
were
sympathetic
but
plainly
not
very
ready
to
take
a
large
number
of
strangers
into
their
little
land
one
of
the
travellers
a
squinteyed
illfavoured
fellow
was
foretelling
that
more
and
more
people
would
be
coming
north
in
the
near
future
'if
room
isn't
found
for
them
they'll
find
it
for
themselves
they've
a
right
to
live
same
as
other
folk'
he
said
loudly
the
local
inhabitants
did
not
look
pleased
at
the
prospect


the
hobbits
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
all
this
and
it
did
not
at
the
moment
seem
to
concern
hobbits
big
folk
could
hardly
beg
for
lodgings
in
hobbitholes
they
were
more
interested
in
sam
and
pippin
who
were
now
feeling
quite
at
home
and
were
chatting
gaily
about
events
in
the
shire
pippin
roused
a
good
deal
of
laughter
with
an
account
of
the
collapse
of
the
roof
of
the
town
hole
in
michel
delving
will
whitfoot
the
mayor
and
the
fattest
hobbit
in
the
westfarthing
had
been
buried
in
chalk
and
came
out
like
a
floured
dumpling
but
there
were
several
questions
asked
that
made
frodo
a
little
uneasy
one
of
the
breelanders
who
seemed
to
have
been
in
the
shire
several
times
wanted
to
know
where
the
underhills
lived
and
who
they
were
related
to

suddenly
frodo
noticed
that
a
strangelooking
weatherbeaten
man
sitting
in
the
shadows
near
the
wall
was
also
listening
intently
to
the
hobbittalk
he
had
a
tall
tankard
in
front
of
him
and
was
smoking
a
longstemmed
pipe
curiously
carved
his
legs
were
stretched
out
before
him
showing
high
boots
of
supple
leather
that
fitted
him
well
but
had
seen
much
wear
and
were
now
caked
with
mud
a
travelstained
cloak
of
heavy
darkgreen
cloth
was
drawn
close
about
him
and
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
room
he
wore
a
hood
that
overshadowed
his
face
but
the
gleam
of
his
eyes
could
be
seen
as
he
watched
the
hobbits

'who
is
that'
frodo
asked
when
he
got
a
chance
to
whisper
to
mr
butterbur
'i
don't
think
you
introduced
him'

'him'
said
the
landlord
in
an
answering
whisper
cocking
an
eye
without
turning
his
head
'i
don't
rightly
know
he
is
one
of
the
wandering
folk
rangers
we
call
them
he
seldom
talks
not
but
what
he
can
tell
a
rare
tale
when
he
has
the
mind
he
disappears
for
a
month
or
a
year
and
then
he
pops
up
again
he
was
in
and
out
pretty
often
last
spring
but
I
haven't
seen
him
about
lately
what
his
right
name
is
i've
never
heard
but
he's
known
round
here
as
strider
goes
about
at
a
great
pace
on
his
long
shanks
though
he
don't
tell
nobody
what
cause
he
has
to
hurry
but
there's
no
accounting
for
east
and
west
as
we
say
in
bree
meaning
the
rangers
and
the
shirefolk
begging
your
pardon
funny
you
should
ask
about
him'
but
at
that
moment
mr
butterbur
was
called
away
by
a
demand
for
more
ale
and
his
last
remark
remained
unexplained

frodo
found
that
strider
was
now
looking
at
him
as
if
he
had
heard
or
guessed
all
that
had
been
said
presently
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
nod
he
invited
frodo
to
come
over
and
sit
by
him
as
frodo
drew
near
be
threw
back
his
hood
showing
a
shaggy
head
of
dark
hair
necked
with
grey
and
in
a
pale
stem
face
a
pair
of
keen
grey
eyes

'i
am
called
strider'
he
said
in
a
low
voice
'i
am
very
pleased
to
meet
you
master

underhill
if
old
butterbur
got
your
name
right'

'he
did'
said
frodo
stiffly
he
felt
far
from
comfortable
under
the
stare
of
those
keen
eyes

'well
master
underhill'
said
strider
'if
I
were
you
I
should
stop
your
young
friends
from
talking
too
much
drink


fire
and
chancemeeting
are
pleasant
enough
but
well

this
isn't
the
shire
there
are
queer
folk
about
though
I
say
it
as
shouldn't
you
may
think'
he
added
with
a
wry
smile
seeing
frodo's
glance
'and
there
have
been
even
stranger
travellers
through
bree
lately'
he
went
on
watching
frodo's
face

frodo
returned
his
gaze
but
said
nothing
and
strider
made
no
further
sign
his
attention
seemed
suddenly
to
be
fixed
on
pippin
to
his
alarm
frodo
became
aware
that
the
ridiculous
young
took
encouraged
by
his
success
with
the
fat
mayor
of
michel
delving
was
now
actually
giving
a
comic
account
of
bilbo's
farewell
party
he
was
already
giving
an
imitation
of
the
speech
and
was
drawing
near
to
the
astonishing
disappearance

frodo
was
annoyed
it
was
a
harmless
enough
tale
for
most
of
the
local
hobbits
no
doubt
just
a
funny
story
about
those
funny
people
away
beyond
the
river
but
some
old
butterbur
for
instance
knew
a
thing
or
two
and
had
probably
heard
rumours
long
ago
about
bilbo's
vanishing
it
would
bring
the
name
of
baggins
to
their
minds
especially
if
there
had
been
inquiries
in
bree
after
that
name


frodo
fidgeted
wondering
what
to
do
pippin
was
evidently
much
enjoying
the
attention
he
was
getting
and
had
become
quite
forgetful
of
their
danger
frodo
had
a
sudden
fear
that
in
his
present
mood
he
might
even
mention
the
ring
and
that
might
well
be
disastrous

'you
had
better
do
something
quick'
whispered
strider
in
his
ear

frodo
jumped
up
and
stood
on
a
table
and
began
to
talk
the
attention
of
pippin's
audience
was
disturbed
some
of
the
hobbits
looked
at
frodo
and
laughed
and
clapped
thinking
that
mr
underhill
had
taken
as
much
ale
as
was
good
for
him

frodo
suddenly
felt
very
foolish
and
found
himself
as
was
his
habit
when
making
a
speech
fingering
the
things
in
his
pocket
he
felt
the
ring
on
its
chain
and
quite
unaccountably
the
desire
came
over
him
to
slip
it
on
and
vanish
out
of
the
silly
situation
it
seemed
to
him
somehow
as
if
me
suggestion
came
to
him
from
outside
from
someone
or
something
a
the
room
he
resisted
the
temptation
firmly
and
clasped
the
ring
in
his
hand
as
if
to
keep
a
hold
on
it
and
prevent
it
from
escaping
or
doing

any

mischief
at
any
rate
it
gave
him
no
inspiration
he
spoke
'a
few
suitable
words'
as
they
would
have
said
in
the
shire

we
are
all
very
much
gratified
by
the
kindness
of
your
reception
and
I
venture
to
hope
that
my
brief
visit
will
help
to
renew
the
old
ties
of
friendship
between
the
shire
and
bree
and
then
he
hesitated
and
coughed

everyone
in
the
room
was
now
looking
at
him
'a
song'
shouted
one
of
the
hobbits
'a
song
a
song'
shouted
all
the
others
'come
on
now
master
sing
us
something
that
we
haven't
heard
before'

for
a
moment
frodo
stood
gaping
then
in
desperation
he
began
a
ridiculous
song
that
bilbo
had
been
rather
fond
of
and
indeed
rather
proud
of
for
he
had
made
up
the
words
himself
it
was
about
an
inn
and
that
is
probably
why
it
came
into
frodo's
mind
just
then
here
it
is
in
full
only
a
few
words
of
it
are
now
as
a
rule
remembered

there
is
an
inn
a
merry
old
inn

beneath
an
old
grey
hill

and
there
they
brew
a
beer
so
brown

that
the
man
in
the
moon
himself
came
down

one
night
to
drink
his
fill

the
ostler
has
a
tipsy
cat

that
plays
a
fivestringed
fiddle

and
up
and
down
he
runs
his
bow

now
squeaking
high
now
purring
low

now
sawing
in
the
middle

the
landlord
keeps
a
little
dog

that
is
mighty
fond
of
jokes

when
there's
good
cheer
among
the
guests

he
cocks
an
ear
at
all
the
jests

and
laughs
until
he
chokes

they
also
keep
a
horned
cow

as
proud
as
any
queen

but
music
turns
her
head
like
ale

and
makes
her
wave
her
tufted
tail

and
dance
upon
the
green

and
o
the
rows
of
silver
dishes

and
the
store
of
silver
spoons



for
sunday
there's
a
special
pair
and
these
they
polish
up
with
care
on
saturday
afternoons

the
man
in
the
moon
was
drinking
deep

and
the
cat
began
to
wail
a
dish
and
a
spoon
on
the
table
danced
the
cow
in
the
garden
madly
pranced

and
the
little
dog
chased
his
tail

the
man
in
the
moon
took
another
mug

and
then
rolled
beneath
his
chair
and
there
he
dozed
and
dreamed
of
ale
till
in
the
sky
the
stars
were
pale

and
dawn
was
in
the
air

then
the
ostler
said
to
his
tipsy
cat

'the
white
horses
of
the
moon
they
neigh
and
champ
their
silver
bits
but
their
master's
been
and
drowned
his
wits

and
the
sun'll
be
rising
soon'

so
the
cat
on
his
fiddle
played
heydiddlediddle

a
jig
that
would
wake
the
dead
he
squeaked
and
sawed
and
quickened
the
tune
while
the
landlord
shook
the
man
in
the
moon

'it's
after
three'
he
said

they
rolled
the
man
slowly
up
the
hill

and
bundled
him
into
the
moon
while
his
horses
galloped
up
in
rear
and
the
cow
came
capering
like
a
deer

and
a
dish
ran
up
with
the
spoon

now
quicker
the
fiddle
went
deedledumdiddle

the
dog
began
to
roar
the
cow
and
the
horses
stood
on
their
heads
the
guests
all
bounded
from
their
beds

and
danced
upon
the
floor

with
a
ping
and
a
pong
the
fiddlestrings
broke

the
cow
jumped
over
the
moon
and
the
little
dog
laughed
to
see
such
fun
and
the
saturday
dish
went
off
at
a
run

with
the
silver
sunday
spoon

the
round
moon
rolled
behind
the
hill

as
the
sun
raised
up
her
head
she
hardly
believed
her
fiery
eyes
for
though
it
was
day
to
her
surprise

they
all
went
back
to
bed

there
was
loud
and
long
applause
frodo
had
a
good
voice
and
the
song
tickled
their
fancy
'where's
old
barley'
they
cried
'he
ought
to
hear
this
bob
ought
to
learn
his
cat
the
fiddle
and
then
we'd
have
a
dance'
they
called
for
more
ale
and
began
to
shout
'let's
have
it
again
master
come
on
now
once
more'

they
made
frodo
have
another
drink
and
then
begin
his
song
again
while
many
of
them
joined
in
for
the
tune
was
well
known
and
they
were
quick
at
picking
up
words
it
was
now
frodo's
turn
to
feel
pleased
with
himself
he
capered
about
on
the
table
and
when
he
came
a
second
time
to

the
cow
jumped
over
the
moon

he
leaped
in
the
air
much
too
vigorously
for
he
came
down
bang
into
a
tray
full
of
mugs
and
slipped
and
rolled
off
the
table
with
a
crash
clatter
and
bump
the
audience
all
opened
their
mouths
wide
for
laughter
and
stopped
short
a
gaping
silence
for
the
singer
disappeared
he
simply
vanished
as
if
he
had
gone
slap
through
the
floor
without
leaving
a
hole

the
local
hobbits
stared
in
amazement
and
then
sprang
to
their
feet
and
shouted
for
barliman
all
the
company
drew
away
from
pippin
and
sam
who
found
themselves
left
alone
in
a
comer
and
eyed
darkly
and
doubtfully
from
a
distance
it
was
plain
that
many
people
regarded
them
now
as
the
companions
of
a
travelling
magician
of
unknown
powers
and
purpose
but
there
was
one
swarthy
breelander
who
stood
looking
at
them
with
a
knowing
and
halfmocking
expression
that
made
them
feel
very
uncomfortable
presently
he
slipped
out
of
the
door
followed
by
the
squinteyed
southerner
the
two
had
been
whispering
together
a
good
deal
during
the
evening
harry
the
gatekeeper
also
went
out
just
behind
them

frodo
felt
a
fool
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
he
crawled
away
under
the
tables
to
the
dark
comer
by
strider
who
sat
unmoved
giving
no
sign
of
his
thoughts
frodo
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
took
off
the
ring
how
it
came
to
be
on
his
finger
he
could
not
tell
he
could
only
suppose
that
he
had
been
handling
it
in
his
pocket
while
he
sang
and
that
somehow
it
had
slipped
on
when
he
stuck
out
his
hand
with
a
jerk
to
save
his
fall
for
a
moment
he
wondered
if
the
ring
itself
had
not
played
him
a
trick
perhaps
it
had
tried
to
reveal
itself
in
response
to
some
wish
or
command
that
was
felt
in
the
room
he
did
not
like
the
looks
of
the
men
that
had
gone
out

'well'
said
strider
when
he
reappeared
'why
did
you
do
that
worse
than
anything
your
friends
could
have
said
you
have
put
your
foot
in
it
or
should
I
say
your
finger'

'i
don't
know
what
you
mean'
said
frodo
annoyed
and
alarmed

'oh
yes
you
do'
answered
strider
'but
we
had
better
wait
until
the
uproar
has
died
down
then
if
you
please
mr

baggins
I

should
like
a
quiet
word
with
you'

'what
about'
asked
frodo
ignoring
the
sudden
use
of
his
proper
name

'a
matter
of
some
importance

to
us
both'
answered
strider
looking
frodo
in
the
eye
'you
may
hear
something
to
your
advantage'

'very
well'
said
frodo
trying
to
appear
unconcerned
'i'll
talk
to
you
later'

meanwhile
an
argument
was
going
on
by
the
fireplace
mr
butterbur
had
come
trotting
in
and
he
was
now
trying
to
listen
to
several
conflicting
accounts
of
the
event
at
the
same
time

'i
saw
him
mr
butterbur'
said
a
hobbit
'or
leastways
I
didn't
see
him
if
you
take
my
meaning
he
just
vanished
into
thin
air
in
a
manner
of
speaking'

'you
don't
say
mr
mugwort'
said
the
landlord
looking
puzzled

'yes
I
do'
replied
mugwort
'and
I
mean
what
I
say
what's
more'

'there's
some
mistake
somewhere'
said
butterbur
shaking
his
head
there
was
too
much
of
that
mr
underhill
to
go
vanishing
into
thin
air
or
into
thick
air
as
is
more
likely
in
this
room'

'well
where
is
he
now'
cried
several
voices

'how
should
I
know
he's
welcome
to
go
where
he
will
so
long
as
he
pays
in
the
morning
there's
mr
took
now
he's
not
vanished'


'well
I
saw
what
I
saw
and
I
saw
what
I
didn't'
said
mugwort
obstinately

'and
I
say
there's
some
mistake'
repeated
butterbur
picking
up
the
tray
and
gathering
up
the
broken
crockery

'of
course
there's
a
mistake'
said
frodo
'i
haven't
vanished
here
I
am
i've
just
been
having
a
few
words
with
strider
in
the
comer'

he
came
forward
into
the
firelight
but
most
of
the
company
backed
away


even
more
perturbed
than
before
they
were
not
in
the
least
satisfied
by
his
explanation
that
he
had
crawled
away
quickly
under
the
tables
after
he
had
fallen
most
of
the
hobbits
and
the
men
of
bree
went
off
then
and
there
in
a
huff
having
no
fancy
for
further
entertainment
that
evening
one
or
two
gave
frodo
a
black
look
and
departed
muttering
among
themselves
the
dwarves
and
the
two
or
three
strange
men
that
still
remained
got
up
and
said
good
night
to
the
landlord
but
not
to
frodo
and
his
friends
before
long
no
one
was
left
but
strider
who
sat
on
unnoticed
by
the
wall

mr
butterbur
did
not
seem
much
put
out
he
reckoned
very
probably
that
his
house
would
be
full
again
on
many
future
nights
until
the
present
mystery
had
been
thoroughly
discussed
'now
what
have
you
been
doing
mr
underhill'
he
asked
'frightening
my
customers
and
breaking
up
my
crocks
with
your
acrobatics'

'i
am
very
sorry
to
have
caused
any
trouble'
said
frodo
'it
was
quite
unintentional
I
assure
you
a
most
unfortunate
accident'

'all
right
mr
underhill
but
if
you're
going
to
do
any
more
tumbling
or
conjuring
or
whatever
it
was
you'd
best
warn
folk
beforehand

and
warn

me

we're
a
bit
suspicious
round
here
of
anything
out
of
the
way
uncanny
if
you
understand
me
and
we
don't
take
to
it
all
of
a
sudden'

'i
shan't
be
doing
anything
of
the
sort
again
mr
butterbur
I
promise
you
and
now
I
think
i'll
be
getting
to
bed
we
shall
be
making
an
early
start
will
you
see
that
our
ponies
are
ready
by
eight
o'clock'

'very
good
but
before
you
go
I
should
like
a
word
with
you
in
private
mr
underhill
something
has
just
come
back
to
my
mind
that
I
ought
to
tell
you
I
hope
that
you'll
not
take
it
amiss
when
i've
seen
to
a
thing
or
two
i'll
come
along
to
your
room
if
you're
willing'

'certainly'
said
frodo
but
his
heart
sank
he
wondered
how
many
private
talks
he
would
have
before
he
got
to
bed
and
what
they
would
reveal
were
these
people
all
in
league
against
him
he
began
to
suspect
even
old
butterbur's
fat
face
of
concealing
dark
designs


chapter
10


strider


frodo
pippin
and
sam
made
their
way
back
to
the
parlour
there
was
no
light
merry
was
not
there
and
the
fire
had
burned
low
it
was
not
until
they
had
puffed
up
the
embers
into
a
blaze
and
thrown
on
a
couple
of
faggots
that
they
discovered
strider
had
come
with
them
there
he
was
calmly
sitting
in
a
chair
by
the
door

'hallo'
said
pippin
'who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want'

'i
am
called
strider'
he
answered
'and
though
he
may
have
forgotten
it
your
friend
promised
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
me'

'you
said
I
might
hear
something
to
my
advantage
I
believe'
said
frodo
'what
have
you
to
say'

'several
things'
answered
strider
'but
of
course
I
have
my
price'

'what
do
you
mean'
asked
frodo
sharply

'don't
be
alarmed
I
mean
just
this
I
will
tell
you
what
I
know
and
give
you
some
good
advice


but
I
shall
want
a
reward'


'and
what
will
that
be
pray'
said
frodo
he
suspected
now
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
rascal
and
he
thought
uncomfortably
that
he
had
brought
only
a
little
money
with
him
all
of
it
would
hardly
satisfy
a
rogue
and
he
could
not
spare
any
of
it

'no
more
than
you
can
afford'
answered
strider
with
a
slow
smile
as
if
he
guessed
frodo's
thoughts
'just
this
you
must
take
me
along
with
you
until
I
wish
to
leave
you'

'oh
indeed'
replied
frodo
surprised
but
not
much
relieved
'even
if
I
wanted
another
companion
I
should
not
agree
to
any
such
thing
until
I
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
you
and
your
business'

'excellent'
exclaimed
strider
crossing
his
legs
and
sitting
back
comfortably
'you
seem
to
be
coming
to
your
senses
again
and
that
is
all
to
the
good
you
have
been
much
too
careless
so
far
very
well
I
will
tell
you
what
I
know
and
leave
the
reward
to
you
you
may
be
glad
to
grant
it
when
you
have
heard
me'

'go
on
then'
said
frodo
'what
do
you
know'

'too
much
too
many
dark
things'
said
strider
grimly
'but
as
for
your
business
'
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
opened
it
quickly
and
looked
out
then
he
shut
it
quietly
and
sat
down
again
'i
have
quick
ears'
he
went
on
lowering
his
voice
'and
though
I
cannot
disappear
I
have
hunted
many
wild
and
wary
things
and
I
can
usually
avoid
being
seen
if
I
wish
now
I
was
behind
the
hedge
this
evening
on
the
road
west
of
bree
when
four
hobbits
came
out
of
the
downlands
I
need
not
repeat
all
that
they
said
to
old
bombadil
or
to
one
another
but
one
thing
interested
me

please
remember

said
one
of
them

that
the
name
baggins
must
not
be
mentioned
I
am
mr
underhill
if
any
name
must
be
given

that
interested
me
so
much
that
I
followed
them
here
I
slipped
over
the
gate
just
behind
them
maybe
mr
baggins
has
an
honest
reason
for
leaving
his
name
behind
but
if
so
I
should
advise
him
and
his
friends
to
be
more
careful'

'i
don't
see
what
interest
my
name
has
for
any
one
in
bree'
said
frodo
angrily
'and
I
have
still
to
learn
why
it
interests
you
mr
strider
may
have
an
honest
reason
for
spying
and
eavesdropping
but
if
so
I
should
advise
him
to
explain
it'

'well
answered'
said
strider
laughing
'but
the
explanation
is
simple

I
was
looking
for
a
hobbit
called
frodo
baggins
I
wanted
to
find
him
quickly
I
had
learned
that
he
was
carrying
out
of
the
shire
well
a
secret
that
concerned
me
and
my
friends

'now
don't
mistake
me'
he
cried
as
frodo
rose
from
his
seat
and
sam
jumped
up
with
a
scowl
'i
shall
take
more
care
of
the
secret
than
you
do
and
care
is
needed'
he
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
them
'watch
every
shadow'
he
said
in
a
low
voice
'black
horsemen
have
passed
through
bree
on
monday
one
came
down
the
greenway
they
say
and
another
appeared
later
coming
up
the
greenway
from
the
south'

there
was
a
silence
at
last
frodo
spoke
to
pippin
and
sam
'i
ought
to
have
guessed
it
from
the
way
the
gatekeeper
greeted
us'
he
said
'and
the
landlord
seems
to
have
heard
something
why
did
he
press
us
to
join
the
company
and
why
on
earth
did
we
behave
so
foolishly
we
ought
to
have
stayed
quiet
in
here'

'it
would
have
been
better'
said
strider
'i
would
have
stopped
your
going
into
the
commonroom
if
I
could
but
the
innkeeper
would
not
let
me
in
to
see
you
or
take
a
message'

'do
you
think
he'
began
frodo

'no
I
don't
think
any
harm
of
old
butterbur
only
he
does
not
altogether
like
mysterious
vagabonds
of
my
sort'
frodo
gave
him
a
puzzled
look
'well
I
have
rather
a
rascally
look
have
I
not'
said
strider
with
a
curl
of
his
lip
and
a
queer
gleam
in
his
eye
'but
I
hope
we
shall
get
to
know
one
another
better
when
we
do
I
hope
you
will
explain
what
happened
at
the
end
of
your
song
for
that
little
prank'

'it
was
sheer
accident'
interrupted
frodo

'i
wonder'
said
strider
'accident
then
that
accident
has
made
your
position
dangerous'


'hardly
more
than
it
was
already'
said
frodo
'i
knew
these
horsemen
were
pursuing
me
but
now
at
any
rate
they
seem
to
have
missed
me
and
to
have
gone
away'

'you
must
not
count
on
that'
said
strider
sharply
'they
will
return
and
more
are
coming
there
are
others
I
know
their
number
I
know
these
riders'
he
paused
and
his
eyes
were
cold
and
hard
'and
there
are
some
folk
in
bree
who
are
not
to
be
trusted'
he
went
on
'bill
ferny
for
instance
he
has
an
evil
name
in
the
breeland
and
queer
folk
call
at
his
house
you
must
have
noticed
him
among
the
company
a
swarthy
sneering
fellow
he
was
very
close
with
one
of
the
southern
strangers
and
they
slipped
out
together
just
after
your
accident
not
all
of
those
southerners
mean
well
and
as
for
ferny
he
would
sell
anything
to
anybody
or
make
mischief
for
amusement'

'what
will
ferny
sell
and
what
has
my
accident
got
to
do
with
him'
said
frodo
still
determined
not
to
understand
strider's
hints

'news
of
you
of
course'
answered
strider
'an
account
of
your
performance
would
be
very
interesting
to
certain
people
after
that
they
would
hardly
need
to
be
told
your
real
name
it
seems
to
me
only
too
likely
that
they
will
hear
of
it
before
this
night
is
over
is
that
enough
you
can
do
as
you
like
about
my
reward
take
me
as
a
guide
or
not
but
I
may
say
that
I
know
all
the
lands
between
the
shire
and
the
misty
mountains
for
I
have
wandered
over
them
for
many
years
I
am
older
than
I
look
I
might
prove
useful
you
will
have
to
leave
the
open
road
after
tonight
for
the
horsemen
will
watch
it
night
and
day
you
may
escape
from
bree
and
be
allowed
to
go
forward
while
the
sun
is
up
but
you
won't
go
far
they
will
come
on
you
in
the
wild
in
some
dark
place
where
there
is
no
help
do
you
wish
them
to
find
you
they
are
terrible'

the
hobbits
looked
at
him
and
saw
with
surprise
that
his
face
was
drawn
as
if
with
pain
and
his
hands
clenched
the
arms
of
his
chair
the
room
was
very
quiet
and
still
and
the
light
seemed
to
have
grown
dim
for
a
while
he
sat
with
unseeing
eyes
as
if
walking
in
distant
memory
or
listening
to
sounds
in
the
night
far
away

'there'
he
cried
after
a
moment
drawing
his
hand
across
his
brow
'perhaps
I
know
more
about
these
pursuers
than
you
do
you
fear
them
but
you
do
not
fear
them
enough
yet
tomorrow
you
will
have
to
escape
if
you
can
strider
can
take
you
by
paths
that
are
seldom
trodden
will
you
have
him'

there
was
a
heavy
silence
frodo
made
no
answer
his
mind
was
confused
with
doubt
and
fear
sam
frowned
and
looked
at
his
master
and
at
last
he
broke
out

'with
your
leave
mr
frodo
i'd
say
no
this
strider
here
he
warns
and
he
says
take
care
and
I

say
yes

to
that
and
let's
begin
with
him
he
comes
out
of
the
wild
and
I
never
heard
no
good
of
such
folk
he
knows
something
that's
plain
and
more
than
I
like
but
it's
no
reason
why
we
should
let
him
go
leading
us
out
into
some
dark
place
far
from
help
as
he
puts
it'

pippin
fidgeted
and
looked
uncomfortable
strider
did
not
reply
to
sam
but
turned
his
keen
eyes
on
frodo
frodo
caught
his
glance
and
looked
away
'no'
he
said
slowly
'i
don't
agree
I
think
I
think
you
are
not
really
as
you
choose
to
look
you
began
to
talk
to
me
like
the
breefolk
but
your
voice
has
changed
still
sam
seems
right
in
this
I
don't
see
why
you
should
warn
us
to
take
care
and
yet
ask
us
to
take
you
on
trust
why
the
disguise
who
are
you
what
do
you
really
know
about

about
my
business
and
how
do
you
know
it'

'the
lesson
in
caution
has
been
well
learned'
said
strider
with
a
grim
smile
'but
caution
is
one
thing
and
wavering
is
another
you
will
never
get
to
rivendell
now
on
your
own
and
to
trust
me
is
your
only
chance
you
must
make
up
your
mind
I
will
answer
some
of
your
questions
if
that
will
help
you
to
do
so
but
why
should
you
believe
my
story
if
you
do
not
trust
me
already
still
here
it
is'

at
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
mr
butterbur
had
arrived
with
candles
and
behind
him
was
nob
with
cans
of
hot
water
strider
withdrew
into
a
dark
corner


'i've
come
to
bid
you
good
night'
said
the
landlord
putting
the
candles
on
the
table
'nob
take
the
water
to
the
rooms'
he
came
in
and
shut
the
door

'it's
like
this'
he
began
hesitating
and
looking
troubled
'if
i've
done
any
harm
i'm
sorry
indeed
but
one
thing
drives
out
another
as
you'll
admit
and
i'm
a
busy
man
but
first
one
thing
and
then
another
this
week
have
jogged
my
memory
as
the
saying
goes
and
not
too
late
I
hope
you
see
I
was
asked
to
look
out
for
hobbits
of
the
shire
and
for
one
by
the
name
of
baggins
in
particular'

'and
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
me'
asked
frodo

'ah
you
know
best'
said
the
landlord
knowingly
'i
won't
give
you
away
but
I
was
told
that
this
baggins
would
be
going
by
the
name
of
underhill
and
I
was
given
a
description
that
fits
you
well
enough
if
I
may
say
so'

'indeed
let's
have
it
then'
said
frodo
unwisely
interrupting


'a
stout
little
fellow
with
red
cheeks'

said
mr
butterbur
solemnly
pippin
chuckled
but
sam
looked
indignant

'that
won't
help
you
much
it
goes
for
most
hobbits
barley

he
says
to
me'
continued
mr
butterbur
with
a
glance
at
pippin

'but
this
one
is
taller
than
some
and
fairer
than
most
and
he
has
a
cleft
in
his
chin
perky
chap
with
a
bright
eye

begging
your
pardon
but
he
said
it
not
me'


'he

said
it
and
who
was
he'
asked
frodo
eagerly

'ah
that
was
gandalf
if
you
know
who
I
mean
a
wizard
they
say
he
is
but
he's
a
good
friend
of
mine
whether
or
no
but
now
I
don't
know
what
he'll
have
to
say
to
me
if
I
see
him
again
turn
all
my
ale
sour
or
me
into
a
block
of
wood
I
shouldn't
wonder
he's
a
bit
hasty
still
what's
done
can't
be
undone
'

'well
what
have
you
done'
said
frodo
getting
impatient
with
the
slow
unravelling
of
butterbur's
thoughts

'where
was
i'
said
the
landlord
pausing
and
snapping
his
fingers
'ah
yes
old
gandalf
three
months
back
he
walked
right
into
my
room
without
a
knock

barley

he
says

i'm
off
in
the
morning
will
you
do
something
for
me
you've
only
to
name
it

I
said

i'm
in
a
hurry

said
he

and
i've
no
time
myself
but
I
want
a
message
took
to
the
shire
have
you
anyone
you
can
send
and
trust
to
go
I
can
find
someone

I
said

tomorrow
maybe
or
the
day
after
make
it
tomorrow

he
says
and
then
he
gave
me
a
letter

'it's
addressed
plain
enough'
said
mr
butterbur
producing
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
reading
out
the
address
slowly
and
proudly
he
valued
his
reputation
as
a
lettered
man


mr
frodo
baggins
bag
end
hobbiton
in
the
shire


'a
letter
for
me
from
gandalf'
cried
frodo

'ah'
said
mr
butterbur
'then
your
right
name
is
baggins'

'it
is'
said
frodo
'and
you
had
better
give
me
that
letter
at
once
and
explain
why
you
never
sent
it
that's
what
you
came
to
tell
me
I
suppose
though
you've
taken
a
long
time
to
come
to
the
point'

poor
mr
butterbur
looked
troubled
'you're
right
master'
he
said
'and
I
beg
your
pardon
and
i'm
mortal
afraid
of
what
gandalf
will
say
if
harm
comes
of
it
but
I
didn't
keep
it
back
apurpose
I
put
it
by
safe
then
I
couldn't
find
nobody
willing
to
go
to
the
shire
next
day
nor
the
day
after
and
none
of
my
own
folk
were
to
spare
and
then
one
thing
after
another
drove
it
out
of
my
mind
i'm
a
busy
man
i'll
do
what
I
can
to
set
matters
right
and
if
there's
any
help
I
can
give
you've
only
to
name
it

'leaving
the
letter
aside
I
promised
gandalf
no
less

barley

he
says
to
me

this
friend
of
mine
from
the
shire
he
may
be
coming
out
this
way
before
long
him
and
another
he'll
be
calling
himself
underhill
mind
that
but
you
need
ask
no
questions
and
if
i'm
not
with
him
he
may
be
in
trouble
and
he
may
need
help
do
whatever
you
can
for
him
and
i'll
be
grateful

he
says
and
here
you
are
and
trouble
is
not
far
off
seemingly'


'what
do
you
mean'
asked
frodo

'these
black
men'
said
the
landlord
lowering
his
voice
'they're
looking
for

baggins

and
if
they
mean
well
then
i'm
a
hobbit
it
was
on
monday
and
all
the
dogs
were
yammering
and
the
geese
screaming
uncanny
I
called
it
nob
he
came
and
told
me
that
two
black
men
were
at
the
door
asking
for
a
hobbit
called
baggins
nob's
hair
was
all
stood
on
end
I
bid
the
black
fellows
be
off
and
slammed
the
door
on
them
but
they've
been
asking
the
same
question
all
the
way
to
archet
I
hear
and
that
ranger
strider
he's
been
asking
questions
too
tried
to
get
in
here
to
see
you
before
you'd
had
bite
or
sup
he
did'

'he
did'
said
strider
suddenly
coming
forward
into
the
light
'and
much
trouble
would
have
been
saved
if
you
had
let
him
in
barliman'

the
landlord
jumped
with
surprise
'you'
he
cried
'you're
always
popping
up
what
do
you
want
now'

'he's
here
with
my
leave'
said
frodo
'he
came
to
offer
me
his
help'

'well
you
know
your
own
business
maybe'
said
mr
butterbur
looking
suspiciously
at
strider
'but
if
I
was
in
your
plight
I
wouldn't
take
up
with
a
ranger'

'then
who
would
you
take
up
with'
asked
strider
'a
fat
innkeeper
who
only
remembers
his
own
name
because
people
shout
it
at
him
all
day
they
cannot
stay
in

the
pony

for
ever
and
they
cannot
go
home
they
have
a
long
road
before
them
will
you
go
with
them
and
keep
the
black
men
off'

'me
leave
bree
I
wouldn't
do
that
for
any
money'
said
mr
butterbur
looking
really
scared
'but
why
can't
you
stay
here
quiet
for
a
bit
mr
underhill
what
are
all
these
queer
goings
on
what
are
these
black
men
after
and
where
do
they
come
from
i'd
like
to
know'

'i'm
sorry
I
can't
explain
it
all'
answered
frodo
'i
am
tired
and
very
worried
and
it's
a
long
tale
but
if
you
mean
to
help
me
I
ought
to
warn
you
that
you
will
be
in
danger
as
long
as
I
am
in
your
house
these
black
riders
I
am
not
sure
but
I
think
I
fear
they
come
from'

'they
come
from
mordor'
said
strider
in
a
low
voice
'from
mordor
barliman
if
that
means
anything
to
you'

'save
us'
cried
mr
butterbur
turning
pale
the
name
evidently
was
known
to
him
'that
is
the
worst
news
that
has
come
to
bree
in
my
time'
'it
is'
said
frodo
'are
you
still
willing
to
help
me'
'i
am'
said
mr
butterbur
'more
than
ever
though
I
don't
know
what
the
likes
of
me
can
do
against
against'
he
faltered

'against
the
shadow
in
the
east'
said
strider
quietly
'not
much
barliman
but
every
little
helps
you
can
let
mr
underhill
stay
here
tonight
as
mr
underhill
and
you
can
forget
the
name
of
baggins
till
he
is
far
away'

'i'll
do
that'
said
butterbur
'but
they'll
find
out
he's
here
without
help
from
me
i'm
afraid
it's
a
pity
mr
baggins
drew
attention
to
himself
this
evening
to
say
no
more
the
story
of
that
mr
bilbo's
going
off
has
been
heard
before
tonight
in
bree
even
our
nob
has
been
doing
some
guessing
in
his
slow
pate
and
there
are
others
in
bree
quicker
in
the
uptake
than
he
is'

'well
we
can
only
hope
the
riders
won't
come
back
yet'
said
frodo

'i
hope
not
indeed'
said
butterbur
'but
spooks
or
no
spooks
they
won't
get
in

the
pony
so
easy
don't
you
worry
till
the
morning
nob'll
say
no
word
no
black
man
shall
pass
my
doors
while
I
can
stand
on
my
legs
me
and
my
folk'll
keep
watch
tonight
but
you
had
best
get
some
sleep
if
you
can'

'in
any
case
we
must
be
called
at
dawn'
said
frodo
'we
must
get
off
as
early
as
possible
breakfast
at
sixthirty
please'

'right
i'll
see
to
the
orders'
said
the
landlord
'good
night
mr
baggins

underhill
I
should
say
good
night

now
bless
me
where's
your
mr
brandybuck'

'i
don't
know'
said
frodo
with
sudden
anxiety
they
had
forgotten
all
about
merry
and
it
was
getting
late
'i
am
afraid
he
is
out
he
said
something
about
going
for
a
breath
of
air'


'well
you
do
want
looking
after
and
no
mistake
your
party
might
be
on
a
holiday'
said
butterbur
'i
must
go
and
bar
the
doors
quick
but
i'll
see
your
friend
is
let
in
when
he
comes
i'd
better
send
nob
to
look
for
him
good
night
to
you
all'
at
last
mr
butterbur
went
out
with
another
doubtful
look
at
strider
and
a
shake
of
his
head
his
footsteps
retreated
down
the
passage

'well'
said
strider
'when
are
you
going
to
open
that
letter'
frodo
looked
carefully
at
the
seal
before
he
broke
it
it
seemed
certainly
to
be
gandalf's
inside
written
in
the
wizard's
strong
but
graceful
script
was
the
following
message


the
prancing
pony
bree
midyear's
day
shire
year
1418



dear
frodo



bad
news
has
reached
me
here
I
must
go
off
at
once
you
had
better
leave
bag
end
soon
and
get
out
of
the
shire
before
the
end
of
july
at
latest
I
will
return
as
soon
as
I
can
and
I
will
follow
you
if
I
find
that
you
are
gone
leave
a
message
for
me
here
if
you
pass
through
bree
you
can
trust
the
landlord
butterbur
you
may
meet
a
friend
of
mine
on
the
road
a
man
lean
dark
tall
by
some
called
strider
he
knows
our
business
and
will
help
you
make
for
rivendell
there
I
hope
we
may
meet
again
if
I
do
not
come
elrond
will
advise
you



yours
in
haste



gandalf



ps
do
not
use
it
again
not
far
any
reason
whatever
do
not
travel
by
night



pps
make
sure
that
it
is
the
real
strider
there
are
many
strange
men
on
the
roads
his
true
name
is
aragorn


all
that
is
gold
does
not
glitter

not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost

the
old
that
is
strong
does
not
wither

deep
roots
are
not
reached
by
the
frost

from
the
ashes
a
fire
shall
be
woken

a
light
from
the
shadows
shall
spring

renewed
shall
be
blade
that
was
broken

the
crownless
again
shall
be
king


ppps
I
hope
butterbur
sends
this
promptly
a
worthy
man
but
his
memory
is
like
a
lumberroom
thing
wanted
always
buried
if
he
forgets
I
shall
roast
him



fare
well


frodo
read
the
letter
to
himself
and
then
passed
it
to
pippin
and
sam
'really
old
butterbur
has
made
a
mess
of
things'
he
said
'he
deserves
roasting
if
I
had
got
this
at
once
we
might
all
have
been
safe
in
rivendell
by
now
but
what
can
have
happened
to
gandalf
he
writes
as
if
he
was
going
into
great
danger'

'he
has
been
doing
that
for
many
years'
said
strider

frodo
turned
and
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
wondering
about
gandalf's
second
postscript
'why
didn't
you
tell
me
that
you
were
gandalf's
friend
at
once'
he
asked
'it
would
have
saved
time'


'would
it
would
any
of
you
have
believed
me
till
now'
said
strider
'i
knew
nothing
of
this
letter
for
all
I
knew
I
had
to
persuade
you
to
trust
me
without
proofs
if
I
was
to
help
you
in
any
case
I
did
not
intend
to
tell
you
all
about
myself
at
once
I
had
to
study

you

first
and
make
sure
of
you
the
enemy
has
set
traps
for
me
before
now
as
soon
as
I
had
made
up
my
mind
I
was
ready
to
tell
you
whatever
you
asked
but
I
must
admit'
he
added
with
a
queer
laugh
'that
I
hoped
you
would
take
to
me
for
my
own
sake
a
hunted
man
sometimes
wearies
of
distrust
and
longs
for
friendship
but
there
I
believe
my
looks
are
against
me'

'they
are

at
first
sight
at
any
rate'
laughed
pippin
with
sudden
relief
after
reading
gandalf's
letter
'but
handsome
is
as
handsome
does
as
we
say
in
the
shire
and
I
daresay
we
shall
all
look
much
the
same
after
lying
for
days
in
hedges
and
ditches'

'it
would
take
more
than
a
few
days
or
weeks
or
years
of
wandering
in
the
wild
to
make
you
look
like
strider'
he
answered
'and
you
would
die
first
unless
you
are
made
of
sterner
stuff
than
you
look
to
be'

pippin
subsided
but
sam
was
not
daunted
and
he
still
eyed
strider
dubiously
'how
do
we
know
you
are
the
strider
that
gandalf
speaks
about'
he
demanded
'you
never
mentioned
gandalf
till
this
letter
came
out
you
might
be
a
playacting
spy
for
all
I
can
see
trying
to
get
us
to
go
with
you
you
might
have
done
in
the
real
strider
and
took
his
clothes
what
have
you
to
say
to
that'

'that
you
are
a
stout
fellow'
answered
strider
'but
I
am
afraid
my
only
answer
to
you
sam
gamgee
is
this
if
I
had
killed
the
real
strider
I
could
kill
you
and
I
should
have
killed
you
already
without
so
much
talk
if
I
was
after
the
ring
I
could
have
it

now'

he
stood
up
and
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
taller
in
his
eyes
gleamed
a
light
keen
and
commanding
throwing
back
his
cloak
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
a
sword
that
had
hung
concealed
by
his
side
they
did
not
dare
to
move
sam
sat
widemouthed
staring
at
him
dumbly

'but
I

am

the
real
strider
fortunately'
he
said
looking
down
at
them
with
his
face
softened
by
a
sudden
smile
'i
am
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
and
if
by
life
or
death
I
can
save
you
I
will'

there
was
a
long
silence
at
last
frodo
spoke
with
hesitation
'i
believed
that
you
were
a
friend
before
the
letter
came'
he
said
'or
at
least
I
wished
to
you
have
frightened
me
several
times
tonight
but
never
in
the
way
that
servants
of
the
enemy
would
or
so
I
imagine
I
think
one
of
his
spies
would

well
seem
fairer
and
feel
fouler
if
you
understand'

'i
see'
laughed
strider
'i
look
foul
and
feel
fair
is
that
it

all
that
is
gold
does
not
glitter
not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost'


'did
the
verses
apply
to
you
then'
asked
frodo
'i
could
not
make
out
what
they
were
about
but
how
did
you
know
that
they
were
in
gandalf's
letter
if
you
have
never
seen
it'

'i
did
not
know'
he
answered
'but
I
am
aragorn
and
those
verses
go
with
that
name'
he
drew
out
his
sword
and
they
saw
that
the
blade
was
indeed
broken
a
foot
below
the
hilt
'not
much
use
is
it
sam'
said
strider
'but
the
time
is
near
when
it
shall
be
forged
anew'

sam
said
nothing

'well'
said
strider
'with
sam's
permission
we
will
call
that
settled
strider
shall
be
your
guide
we
shall
have
a
rough
road
tomorrow
even
if
we
are
allowed
to
leave
bree
unhindered
we
can
hardly
hope
now
to
leave
it
unnoticed
but
I
shall
try
to
get
lost
as
soon
as
possible
I
know
one
or
two
ways
out
of
breeland
other
than
the
main
road
if
once
we
shake
off
the
pursuit
I
shall
make
for
weathertop'

'weathertop'
said
sam
'what's
that'

'it
is
a
hill
just
to
the
north
of
the
road
about
half
way
from
here
to
rivendell
it
commands
a
wide
view
all
round
and
there
we
shall
have
a
chance
to
look
about
us
gandalf
will
make
for
that
point
if
he
follows
us
after
weathertop
our
journey
will
become
more
difficult
and
we
shall
have
to
choose
between
various
dangers'

'when
did
you
last
see
gandalf'
asked
frodo
'do
you
know
where
he
is
or
what
he
is
doing'


strider
looked
grave
'i
do
not
know'
he
said
'i
came
west
with
him
in
the
spring
I
have
often
kept
watch
on
the
borders
of
the
shire
in
the
last
few
years
when
he
was
busy
elsewhere
he
seldom
left
it
unguarded
we
last
met
on
the
first
of
may
at
sam
ford
down
the
brandywine
he
told
me
that
his
business
with
you
had
gone
well
and
that
you
would
be
starting
for
rivendell
in
the
last
week
of
september
as
I
knew
he
was
at
your
side
I
went
away
on
a
journey
of
my
own
and
that
has
proved
ill
for
plainly
some
news
reached
him
and
I
was
not
at
hand
to
help

'i
am
troubled
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
known
him
we
should
have
had
messages
even
if
he
could
not
come
himself
when
I
returned
many
days
ago
I
heard
the
ill
news
the
tidings
had
gone
far
and
wide
that
gandalf
was
missing
and
the
horsemen
had
been
seen
it
was
the
elvenfolk
of
gildor
that
told
me
this
and
later
they
told
me
that
you
had
left
your
home
but
there
was
no
news
of
your
leaving
buckland
I
have
been
watching
the
east
road
anxiously'

'do
you
think
the
black
riders
have
anything
to
do
with
it

with
gandalf's
absence
I
mean'
asked
frodo

'i
do
not
know
of
anything
else
that
could
have
hindered
him
except
the
enemy
himself'
said
strider
'but
do
not
give
up
hope
gandalf
is
greater
than
you
shirefolk
know

as
a
rule
you
can
only
see
his
jokes
and
toys
but
this
business
of
ours
will
be
his
greatest
task'

pippin
yawned
'i
am
sorry'
he
said
'but
I
am
dead
tired
in
spite
of
all
the
danger
and
worry
I
must
go
to
bed
or
sleep
where
I
sit
where
is
that
silly
fellow
merry
it
would
be
the
last
straw
if
we
had
to
go
out
in
the
dark
to
look
for
him'

at
that
moment
they
heard
a
door
slam
then
feet
came
running
along
the
passage
merry
came
in
with
a
rush
followed
by
nob
he
shut
the
door
hastily
and
leaned
against
it
he
was
out
of
breath
they
stared
at
him
in
alarm
for
a
moment
before
he
gasped
'i
have
seen
them
frodo
I
have
seen
them
black
riders'

'black
riders'
cried
frodo
'where'

'here
in
the
village
I
stayed
indoors
for
an
hour
then
as
you
did
not
come
back
I
went
out
for
a
stroll
I
had
come
back
again
and
was
standing
just
outside
the
light
of
the
lamp
looking
at
the
stars
suddenly
I
shivered
and
felt
that
something
horrible
was
creeping
near
there
was
a
son
of
deeper
shade
among
the
shadows
across
the
road
just
beyond
the
edge
of
the
lamplight
it
slid
away
at
once
into
the
dark
without
a
sound
there
was
no
horse'

'which
way
did
it
go'
asked
strider
suddenly
and
sharply
merry
started
noticing
the
stranger
for
the
first
time
'go
on'
said
frodo
'this
is
a
friend
of
gandalf's
I
will
explain
later'

'it
seemed
to
make
off
up
the
road
eastward'
continued
merry
'i
tried
to
follow
of
course
it
vanished
almost
at
once
but
I
went
round
the
corner
and
on
as
far
as
the
last
house
on
the
road'

strider
looked
at
merry
with
wonder
'you
have
a
stout
heart'
he
said
'but
it
was
foolish'

'i
don't
know'
said
merry
'neither
brave
nor
silly
I
think
I
could
hardly
help
myself
I
seemed
to
be
drawn
somehow
anyway
I
went
and
suddenly
I
heard
voices
by
the
hedge
one
was
muttering
and
the
other
was
whispering
or
hissing
I
couldn't
hear
a
word
that
was
said
I
did
not
creep
any
closer
because
I
began
to
tremble
all
over
then
I
felt
terrified
and
I
turned
back
and
was
just
going
to
bolt
home
when
something
came
behind
me
and
I
I
fell
over'

'i
found
him
sir'
put
in
nob
'mr
butterbur
sent
me
out
with
a
lantern
I
went
down
to
westgate
and
then
back
up
towards
southgate
just
nigh
bill
ferny's
house
I
thought
I
could
see
something
in
the
road
I
couldn't
swear
to
it
but
it
looked
to
me
as
if
two
men
was
stooping
over
something
lilting
it
I
gave
a
shout
but
where
I
got
up
to
the
spot
there
was
no
signs
of
them
and
only
mr
brandybuck
lying
by
the
roadside
he
seemed
to
be
asleep
I
thought
I
had
fallen
into
deep
water
he
says
to
me
when
I
shook
him
very
queer
he
was
and
as
soon
as
I
had
roused
him
he
got
up
and
ran
back
here
like
a
hare'

'i
am
afraid
that's
true'
said
merry
'though
I
don't
know
what
I
said
I
had
an
ugly
dream
which
I
can't
remember
I
went
to
pieces
I
don't
know
what
came
over
me'


'i
do'
said
strider
'the
black
breath
the
riders
must
have
left
their
horses
outside
and
passed
back
through
the
southgate
in
secret
they
will
know
all
the
news
now
for
they
have
visited
bill
ferny
and
probably
that
southerner
was
a
spy
as
well
something
may
happen
in
the
night
before
we
leave
bree'

'what
will
happen'
said
merry
'will
they
attack
the
inn'
'no
I
think
not'
said
strider
'they
are
not
all
here
yet
and
in
any
case
that
is
not
their
way
in
dark
and
loneliness
they
are
strongest
they
will
not
openly
attack
a
house
where
there
are
lights
and
many
people
not
until
they
are
desperate
not
while
all
the
long
leagues
of
eriador
still
lie
before
us
but
their
power
is
in
terror
and
already
some
in
bree
are
in
their
clutch
they
will
drive
these
wretches
to
some
evil
work
ferny
and
some
of
the
strangers
and
maybe
the
gatekeeper
too
they
had
words
with
harry
at
westgate
on
monday
I
was
watching
them
he
was
white
and
shaking
when
they
left
him'

'we
seem
to
have
enemies
all
round'
said
frodo
'what
are
we
to
do'

'stay
here
and
do
not
go
to
your
rooms
they
are
sure
to
have
found
out
which
those
are
the
hobbitrooms
have
windows
looking
north
and
close
to
the
ground
we
will
all
remain
together
and
bar
this
window
and
the
door
but
first
nob
and
I
will
fetch
your
luggage'

while
strider
was
gone
frodo
gave
merry
a
rapid
account
of
all
that
had
happened
since
supper
merry
was
still
reading
and
pondering
gandalf's
letter
when
strider
and
nob
returned

'well
masters'
said
nob
'i've
ruffled
up
the
clothes
and
put
in
a
bolster
down
the
middle
of
each
bed
and
I
made
a
nice
imitation
of
your
head
with
a
brown
woollen
mat
mr
bag

underhill
sir'
he
added
with
a
grin

pippin
laughed
'very
lifelike'
he
said
'but
what
will
happen
when
they
have
penetrated
the
disguise'

'we
shall
see'
said
strider
'let
us
hope
to
hold
the
fort
till
morning'

'good
night
to
you'
said
nob
and
went
off
to
take
his
part
in
the
watch
on
the
doors

their
bags
and
gear
they
piled
on
the
parlourfloor
they
pushed
a
low
chair
against
the
door
and
shut
the
window
peering
out
frodo
saw
that
the
night
was
still
clear
the
sickle
was
swinging
bright
above
the
shoulders
of
breehill
he
then
closed
and
barred
the
heavy
inside
shutters
and
drew
the
curtains
together
strider
built
up
the
fire
and
blew
out
all
the
candles

the
hobbits
lay
down
on
their
blankets
with
their
feet
towards
the
hearth
but
strider
settled
himself
in
the
chair
against
the
door
they
talked
for
a
little
for
merry
still
had
several
questions
to
ask

'jumped
over
the
moon'
chuckled
merry
as
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
'very
ridiculous
of
you
frodo
but
I
wish
I
had
been
there
to
see
the
worthies
of
bree
will
be
discussing
it
a
hundred
years
hence'

'i
hope
so'
said
strider
then
they
all
fell
silent
and
one
by
one
the
hobbits
dropped
off
to
sleep

a
knife
in
the
dark


as
they
prepared
for
sleep
in
the
inn
at
bree
darkness
lay
on
buckland
a
mist
strayed
in
the
dells
and
along
the
riverbank
the
house
at
crickhollow
stood
silent
fatty
bolger
opened
the
door
cautiously
and
peered
out
a
feeling
of
fear
had
been
growing
on
him
all
day
and
he
was
unable
to
rest
or
go
to
bed
there
was
a
brooding
threat
in
the
breathless
nightair
as
he
stared
out
into
the
gloom
a
black
shadow
moved
under
the
trees
the
gate
seemed
to
open
of
its
own
accord
and
close
again
without
a
sound
terror
seized
him
he
shrank
back
and
for
a
moment
he
stood
trembling
in
the
hall
then
he
shut
and
locked
the
door

the
night
deepened
there
came
the
soft
sound
of
horses
led
with
stealth
along
the
lane
outside
the
gate
they
stopped
and
three
black
figures
entered
like
shades
of
night
creeping
across
the
ground
one
went
to
the
door
one
to
the
corner
of
the
house
on
either
side
and
there
they
stood
as
still
as
the
shadows
of
stones
while
night
went
slowly
on
the
house
and
the
quiet
trees
seemed
to
be
waiting
breathlessly

there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
leaves
and
a
cock
crowed
far
away
the
cold
hour
before
dawn
was
passing
the
figure
by
the
door
moved
in
the
dark
without
moon
or
stars
a
drawn
blade
gleamed
as
if
a
chill
light
had
been
unsheathed
there
was
a
blow
soft
but
heavy
and
the
door
shuddered

'open
in
the
name
of
mordor'
said
a
voice
thin
and
menacing

at
a
second
blow
the
door
yielded
and
fell
back
with
timbers
burst
and
lock
broken
the
black
figures
passed
swiftly
in

at
that
moment
among
the
trees
nearby
a
horn
rang
out
it
rent
the
night
like
fire
on
a
hilltop

awake
fear
fire
foes
awake

fatty
bolger
had
not
been
idle
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
dark
shapes
creep
from
the
garden
he
knew
that
he
must
run
for
it
or
perish
and
run
he
did
out
of
the
back
door
through
the
garden
and
over
the
fields
when
he
reached
the
nearest
house
more
than
a
mile
away
he
collapsed
on
the
doorstep
'no
no
no'
he
was
crying
'no
not
me
I
haven't
got
it'
it
was
some
time
before
anyone
could
make
out
what
he
was
babbling
about
at
last
they
got
the
idea
that
enemies
were
in
buckland
some
strange
invasion
from
the
old
forest
and
then
they
lost
no
more
time

fear
fire
foes

the
brandybucks
were
blowing
the
horncall
of
buckland
that
had
not
been
sounded
for
a
hundred
years
not
since
the
white
wolves
came
in
the
fell
winter
when
the
brandywine
was
frozen
over

awake
awake

faraway
answering
horns
were
heard
the
alarm
was
spreading
the
black
figures
fled
from
the
house
one
of
them
let
fall
a
hobbitcloak
on
the
step
as
he
ran
in
the
lane
the
noise
of
hoofs
broke
out
and
gathering
to
a
gallop
went
hammering
away
into
the
darkness
all
about
crickhollow
there
was
the
sound
of
horns
blowing
and
voices
crying
and
feet
running
but
the
black
riders
rode
like
a
gale
to
the
northgate
let
the
little
people
blow
sauron
would
deal
with
them
later
meanwhile
they
had
another
errand
they
knew
now
that
the
house
was
empty
and
the
ring
had
gone
they
rode
down
the
guards
at
the
gate
and
vanished
from
the
shire

in
the
early
night
frodo
woke
from
deep
sleep
suddenly
as
if
some
sound
or
presence
had
disturbed
him
he
saw
that
strider
was
sitting
alert
in
his
chair
his
eyes
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
fire
which
had
been
tended
and
was
burning
brightly
but
he
made
no
sign
or
movement

frodo
soon
went
to
sleep
again
but
his
dreams
were
again
troubled
with
the
noise
of
wind
and
of
galloping
hoofs
the
wind
seemed
to
be
curling
round
the
house
and
shaking
it
and
far
off
he
heard
a
horn
blowing
wildly
he
opened
his
eyes
and
heard
a
cock
crowing
lustily
in
the
innyard
strider
had
drawn
the
curtains
and
pushed
back
the
shutters
with
a
clang
the
first
grey
light
of
day
was
in
the
room
and
a
cold
air
was
coming
through
the
open
window

as
soon
as
strider
had
roused
them
all
he
led
the
way
to
their
bedrooms
when
they
saw
them
they
were
glad
that
they
had
taken
his
advice
the
windows
had
been
forced
open
and
were
swinging
and
the
curtains
were
flapping
the
beds
were
tossed
about
and
the
bolsters
slashed
and
flung
upon
the
floor
the
brown
mat
was
torn
to
pieces


strider
immediately
went
to
fetch
the
landlord
poor
mr
butterbur
looked
sleepy
and
frightened
he
had
hardly
closed
his
eyes
all
night
so
he
said
but
he
had
never
heard
a
sound

'never
has
such
a
thing
happened
in
my
time'
he
cried
raising
his
hands
in
horror
'guests
unable
to
sleep
in
their
beds
and
good
bolsters
ruined
and
all
what
are
we
coming
to'

'dark
times'
said
strider
'but
for
the
present
you
may
be
left
in
peace
when
you
have
got
rid
of
us
we
will
leave
at
once
never
mind
about
breakfast
a
drink
and
a
bite
standing
will
have
to
do
we
shall
be
packed
in
a
few
minutes'

mr
butterbur
hurried
off
to
see
that
their
ponies
were
got
ready
and
to
fetch
them
a
'bite'
but
very
soon
he
came
back
in
dismay
the
ponies
had
vanished
the
stabledoors
had
all
been
opened
in
the
night
and
they
were
gone
not
only
merry's
ponies
but
every
other
horse
and
beast
in
the
place

frodo
was
crushed
by
the
news
how
could
they
hope
to
reach
rivendell
on
foot
pursued
by
mounted
enemies
they
might
as
well
set
out
for
the
moon
strider
sat
silent
for
a
while
looking
at
the
hobbits
as
if
he
was
weighing
up
their
strength
and
courage

'ponies
would
not
help
us
to
escape
horsemen'
he
said
at
last
thoughtfully
as
if
he
guessed
what
frodo
had
in
mind
'we
should
not
go
much
slower
on
foot
not
on
the
roads
that
I
mean
to
take
I
was
going
to
walk
in
any
case
it
is
the
food
and
stores
that
trouble
me
we
cannot
count
on
getting
anything
to
eat
between
here
and
rivendell
except
what
we
take
with
us
and
we
ought
to
take
plenty
to
spare
for
we
may
be
delayed
or
forced
to
go
roundabout
far
out
of
the
direct
way
how
much
are
you
prepared
to
carry
on
your
backs'

'as
much
as
we
must'
said
pippin
with
a
sinking
heart
but
trying
to
show
that
he
was
tougher
than
he
looked
or
felt

'i
can
carry
enough
for
two'
said
sam
defiantly

'can't
anything
be
done
mr
butterbur'
asked
frodo
'can't
we
get
a
couple
of
ponies
in
the
village
or
even
one
just
for
the
baggage
I
don't
suppose
we
could
hire
them
but
we
might
be
able
to
buy
them'
he
added
doubtfully
wondering
if
he
could
afford
it

'i
doubt
it'
said
the
landlord
unhappily
'the
two
or
three
ridingponies
that
there
were
in
bree
were
stabled
in
my
yard
and
they're
gone
as
for
other
animals
horses
or
ponies
for
draught
or
what
not
there
are
very
few
of
them
in
bree
and
they
won't
be
for
sale
but
i'll
do
what
I
can
i'll
rout
out
bob
and
send
him
round
as
soon
as
may
be'

'yes'
said
strider
reluctantly
'you
had
better
do
that
I
am
afraid
we
shall
have
to
try
to
get
one
pony
at
least
but
so
ends
all
hope
of
starting
early
and
slipping
away
quietly
we
might
as
well
have
blown
a
horn
to
announce
our
departure
that
was
part
of
their
plan
no
doubt'

'there
is
one
crumb
of
comfort'
said
merry
'and
more
than
a
crumb
I
hope
we
can
have
breakfast
while
we
wait

and
sit
down
to
it
let's
get
hold
of
nob'

in
the
end
there
was
more
than
three
hours'
delay
bob
came
back
with
the
report
that
no
horse
or
pony
was
to
be
got
for
love
or
money
in
the
neighbourhood

except
one
bill
ferny
had
one
that
he
might
possibly
sell
'a
poor
old
halfstarved
creature
it
is'
said
bob
'but
he
won't
part
with
it
for
less
than
thrice
its
worth
seeing
how
you're
placed
not
if
I
knows
bill
ferny'

'bill
ferny'
said
frodo
'isn't
there
some
trick
wouldn't
the
beast
bolt
back
to
him
with
all
our
stuff
or
help
in
tracking
us
or
something'

'i
wonder'
said
strider
'but
I
cannot
imagine
any
animal
running
home
to
him
once
it
got
away
I
fancy
this
is
only
an
afterthought
of
kind
master
ferny's
just
a
way
of
increasing
his
profits
from
the
affair
the
chief
danger
is
that
the
poor
beast
is
probably
at
death's
door
but
there
does
not
seem
any
choice
what
does
he
want
for
it'

bill
ferny's
price
was
twelve
silver
pennies
and
that
was
indeed
at
least
three
times
the
pony's
value
in
those
pans
it
proved
to
be
a
bony
underfed
and
dispirited
animal
but
it
did
not
look
like
dying
just
yet
mr
butterbur
paid
for
it
himself
and
offered
merry
another
eighteen
pence
as
some
compensation
for
the
lost
animals
he
was
an
honest
man
and
welloff
as
things
were
reckoned
in
bree
but
thirty
silver
pennies
was
a
sore
blow
to
him
and
being
cheated
by
bill
ferny
made
it
harder
to
bear

as
a
matter
of
fact
he
came
out
on
the
right
side
in
the
end
it
turned
out
later
that
only
one
horse
had
been
actually
stolen
the
others
had
been
driven
off
or
had
bolted
in
terror
and
were
found
wandering
in
different
corners
of
the
breeland
merry's
ponies
had
escaped
altogether
and
eventually
having
a
good
deal
of
sense
they
made
their
way
to
the
downs
in
search
of
fatty
lumpkin
so
they
came
under
the
care
of
tom
bombadil
for
a
while
and
were
welloff
but
when
news
of
the
events
at
bree
came
to
tom's
ears
he
sent
them
to
mr
butterbur
who
thus
got
five
good
beasts
at
a
very
fair
price
they
had
to
work
harder
in
bree
but
bob
treated
them
well
so
on
the
whole
they
were
lucky
they
missed
a
dark
and
dangerous
journey
but
they
never
came
to
rivendell

however
in
the
meanwhile
for
all
mr
butterbur
knew
his
money
was
gone
for
good
or
for
bad
and
he
had
other
troubles
for
there
was
a
great
commotion
as
soon
as
the
remaining
guests
were
astir
and
heard
news
of
the
raid
on
the
inn
the
southern
travellers
had
lost
several
horses
and
blamed
the
innkeeper
loudly
until
it
became
known
that
one
of
their
own
number
had
also
disappeared
in
the
night
none
other
than
bill
ferny's
squinteyed
companion
suspicion
fell
on
him
at
once

'if
you
pick
up
with
a
horsethief
and
bring
him
to
my
house'
said
butterbur
angrily
'you
ought
to
pay
for
all
the
damage
yourselves
and
not
come
shouting
at
me
go
and
ask
ferny
where
your
handsome
friend
is'
but
it
appeared
that
he
was
nobody's
friend
and
nobody
could
recollect
when
he
had
joined
their
party

after
their
breakfast
the
hobbits
had
to
repack
and
get
together
further
supplies
for
the
longer
journey
they
were
now
expecting
it
was
close
on
ten
o'clock
before
they
at
last
got
off
by
that
time
the
whole
of
bree
was
buzzing
with
excitement
frodo's
vanishing
trick
the
appearance
of
the
black
horsemen
the
robbing
of
the
stables
and
not
least
the
news
that
strider
the
ranger
had
joined
the
mysterious
hobbits
made
such
a
tale
as
would
last
for
many
uneventful
years
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
bree
and
staddle
and
many
even
from
combe
and
archet
were
crowded
in
the
road
to
see
the
travellers
start
the
other
guests
in
the
inn
were
at
the
doors
or
hanging
out
of
the
windows

strider
had
changed
his
mind
and
he
decided
to
leave
bree
by
the
main
road
any
attempt
to
set
off
across
country
at
once
would
only
make
matters
worse
half
the
inhabitants
would
follow
them
to
see
what
they
were
up
to
and
to
prevent
them
from
trespassing

they
said
farewell
to
nob
and
bob
and
took
leave
of
mr
butterbur
with
many
thanks
'i
hope
we
shall
meet
again
some
day
when
things
are
merry
once
more'
said
frodo
'i
should
like
nothing
better
than
to
stay
in
your
house
in
peace
for
a
while'

they
tramped
off
anxious
and
downhearted
under
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
not
all
the
faces
were
friendly
nor
all
the
words
that
were
shouted
but
strider
seemed
to
be
held
in
awe
by
most
of
the
breelanders
and
those
that
he
stared
at
shut
their
mouths
and
drew
away
he
walked
in
front
with
frodo
next
came
merry
and
pippin
and
last
came
sam
leading
the
pony
which
was
laden
with
as
much
of
their
baggage
as
they
had
the
heart
to
give
it
but
already
it
looked
less
dejected
as
if
it
approved
of
the
change
in
its
fortunes
sam
was
chewing
an
apple
thoughtfully
he
had
a
pocket
full
of
them
a
parting
present
from
nob
and
bob
'apples
for
walking
and
a
pipe
for
sitting'
he
said
'but
I
reckon
i'll
miss
them
both
before
long'

the
hobbits
took
no
notice
of
the
inquisitive
heads
that
peeped
out
of
doors
or
popped
over
walls
and
fences
as
they
passed
but
as
they
drew
near
to
the
further
gate
frodo
saw
a
dark
illkept
house
behind
a
thick
hedge
the
last
house
in
the
village
in
one
of
the
windows
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
sallow
face
with
sly
slanting
eyes
but
it
vanished
at
once

'so
that's
where
that
southerner
is
hiding'
he
thought
'he
looks
more
than
half
like
a
goblin'


over
the
hedge
another
man
was
staring
boldly
he
had
heavy
black
brows
and
dark
scornful
eyes
his
large
mouth
curled
in
a
sneer
he
was
smoking
a
short
black
pipe
as
they
approached
he
took
it
out
of
his
mouth
and
spat

'morning
longshanks'
he
said
'off
early
found
some
friends
at
last'
strider
nodded
but
did
not
answer
'morning
my
little
friends'
he
said
to
the
others
'i
suppose
you
know
who
you've
taken
up
with
that's
stickatnaught
strider
that
is
though
i've
heard
other
names
not
so
pretty
watch
out
tonight
and
you
sammie
don't
go
illtreating
my
poor
old
pony
pah'
he
spat
again

sam
turned
quickly
'and
you
ferny'
he
said
'put
your
ugly
face
out
of
sight
or
it
will
get
hurt'
with
a
sudden
flick
quick
as
lightning
an
apple
left
his
hand
and
hit
bill
square
on
the
nose
he
ducked
too
late
and
curses
came
from
behind
the
hedge
'waste
of
a
good
apple'
said
sam
regretfully
and
strode
on

at
last
they
left
the
village
behind
the
escort
of
children
and
stragglers
that
had
followed
them
got
tired
and
turned
back
at
the
southgate
passing
through
they
kept
on
along
the
road
for
some
miles
it
bent
to
the
left
curving
back
into
its
eastward
line
as
it
rounded
the
feet
of
breehill
and
then
it
began
to
run
swiftly
downwards
into
wooded
country
to
their
left
they
could
see
some
of
the
houses
and
hobbitholes
of
staddle
on
the
gentler
southeastern
slopes
of
the
hill
down
in
a
deep
hollow
away
north
of
the
road
there
were
wisps
of
rising
smoke
that
showed
where
combe
lay

archet
was
hidden
in
the
trees
beyond

after
the
road
had
run
down
some
way
and
had
left
breehill
standing
tall
and
brown
behind
they
came
on
a
narrow
track
that
led
off
towards
the
north
'this
is
where
we
leave
the
open
and
take
to
cover'
said
strider

'not
a
short
cut
I
hope'
said
pippin
'our
last
short
cut
through
woods
nearly
ended
in
disaster'

'ah
but
you
had
not
got
me
with
you
then'
laughed
strider
'my
cuts
short
or
long
don't
go
wrong'
he
took
a
look
up
and
down
the
road
no
one
was
in
sight
and
he
led
the
way
quickly
down
towards
the
wooded
valley

his
plan
as
far
as
they
could
understand
it
without
knowing
the
country
was
to
go
towards
archet
at
first
but
to
bear
right
and
pass
it
on
the
east
and
then
to
steer
as
straight
as
he
could
over
the
wild
lands
to
weathertop
hill
in
that
way
they
would
if
all
went
well
cut
off
a
great
loop
of
the
road
which
further
on
bent
southwards
to
avoid
the
midgewater
marshes
but
of
course
they
would
have
to
pass
through
the
marshes
themselves
and
strider's
description
of
them
was
not
encouraging

however
in
the
meanwhile
walking
was
not
unpleasant
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
disturbing
events
of
the
night
before
they
would
have
enjoyed
this
pan
of
the
journey
better
than
any
up
to
that
time
the
sun
was
shining
clear
but
not
too
hot
the
woods
in
the
valley
were
still
leafy
and
full
of
colour
and
seemed
peaceful
and
wholesome
strider
guided
them
confidently
among
the
many
crossing
paths
although
left
to
themselves
they
would
soon
have
been
at
a
loss
he
was
taking
a
wandering
course
with
many
turns
and
doublings
to
put
off
any
pursuit

'bill
ferny
will
have
watched
where
we
left
the
road
for
certain'
he
said
'though
I
don't
think
he
will
follow
us
himself
he
knows
the
land
round
here
well
enough
but
he
knows
he
is
not
a
match
for
me
in
a
wood
it
is
what
he
may
tell
others
that
I
am
afraid
of
I
don't
suppose
they
are
far
away
if
they
think
we
have
made
for
archet
so
much
the
better'

whether
because
of
strider's
skill
or
for
some
other
reason
they
saw
no
sign
and
heard
no
sound
of
any
other
living
thing
all
that
day
neither
twofooted
except
birds
nor
fourfooted
except
one
fox
and
a
few
squirrels
the
next
day
they
began
to
steer
a
steady
course
eastwards
and
still
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
on
the
third
day
out
from
bree
they
came
out
of
the
chetwood
the
land
had
been
falling
steadily
ever
since
they
turned
aside
from
the
road
and
they
now
entered
a
wide
flat
expanse
of
country
much
more
difficult
to
manage
they
were
far
beyond
the
borders
of
the
breeland
out
in
the
pathless
wilderness
and
drawing
near
to
the
midgewater
marshes

the
ground
now
became
damp
and
in
places
boggy
and
here
and
there
they
came
upon
pools
and
wide
stretches
of
reeds
and
rushes
filled
with
the
warbling
of
little
hidden
birds
they
had
to
pick
their
way
carefully
to
keep
both
dryfooted
and
on
their
proper
course
at
first
they
made
fanprogress
but
as
they
went
on
their
passage
became
slower
and
more
dangerous
the
marshes
were
bewildering
and
treacherous
and
there
was
no
permanent
trail
even
for
rangers
to
find
through
their
shifting
quagmires
the
flies
began
to
torment
them
and
the
air
was
full
of
clouds
of
tiny
midges
that
crept
up
their
sleeves
and
breeches
and
into
their
hair

'i
am
being
eaten
alive'
cried
pippin
'midgewater
there
are
more
midges
than
water'

'what
do
they
live
on
when
they
can't
get
hobbit'
asked
sam
scratching
his
neck

they
spent
a
miserable
day
in
this
lonely
and
unpleasant
country
their
campingplace
was
damp
cold
and
uncomfortable
and
the
biting
insects
would
not
let
them
sleep
there
were
also
abominable
creatures
haunting
the
reeds
and
tussocks
that
from
the
sound
of
them
were
evil
relatives
of
the
cricket
there
were
thousands
of
them
and
they
squeaked
all
round

neekbreek
breekneek

unceasingly
all
the
night
until
the
hobbits
were
nearly
frantic

the
next
day
the
fourth
was
little
better
and
the
night
almost
as
comfortless
though
the
neekerbreekers
as
sam
called
them
had
been
left
behind
the
midges
still
pursued
them

as
frodo
lay
tired
but
unable
to
close
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
far
away
there
came
a
light
in
the
eastern
sky
it
flashed
and
faded
many
times
it
was
not
the
dawn
for
that
was
still
some
hours
off

'what
is
the
light'
he
said
to
strider
who
had
risen
and
was
standing
gazing
ahead
into
the
night

'i
do
not
know'
strider
answered
'it
is
too
distant
to
make
out
it
is
like
lightning
that
leaps
up
from
the
hilltops'

frodo
lay
down
again
but
for
a
long
while
he
could
still
see
the
white
flashes
and
against
them
the
tall
dark
figure
of
strider
standing
silent
and
watchful
at
last
he
passed
into
uneasy
sleep

they
had
not
gone
far
on
the
fifth
day
when
they
left
the
last
straggling
pools
and
reedbeds
of
the
marshes
behind
them
the
land
before
them
began
steadily
to
rise
again
away
in
the
distance
eastward
they
could
now
see
a
line
of
hills
the
highest
of
them
was
at
the
right
of
the
line
and
a
little
separated
from
the
others
it
had
a
conical
top
slightly
flattened
at
the
summit

'that
is
weathertop'
said
strider
'the
old
road
which
we
have
left
far
away
on
our
right
runs
to
the
south
of
it
and
passes
not
far
from
its
foot
we
might
reach
it
by
noon
tomorrow
if
we
go
straight
towards
it
I
suppose
we
had
better
do
so'

'what
do
you
mean'
asked
frodo

'i
mean
when
we
do
get
there
it
is
not
certain
what
we
shall
find
it
is
close
to
the
road'

'but
surely
we
were
hoping
to
find
gandalf
there'

'yes
but
the
hope
is
faint
if
he
comes
this
way
at
all
he
may
not
pass
through
bree
and
so
he
may
not
know
what
we
are
doing
and
anyway
unless
by
luck
we
arrive
almost
together
we
shall
miss
one
another
it
will
not
be
safe
for
him
or
for
us
to
wait
there
long
if
the
riders
fail
to
find
us
in
the
wilderness
they
are
likely
to
make
for
weathertop
themselves
it
commands
a
wide
view
all
round
indeed
there
are
many
birds
and
beasts
in
this
country
that
could
see
us
as
we
stand
here
from
that
hilltop
not
all
the
birds
are
to
be
trusted
and
there
are
other
spies
more
evil
than
they
are'

the
hobbits
looked
anxiously
at
the
distant
hills
sam
looked
up
into
the
pale
sky
fearing
to
see
hawks
or
eagles
hovering
over
them
with
bright
unfriendly
eyes
'you
do
make
me
feel
uncomfortable
and
lonesome
strider'
he
said

'what
do
you
advise
us
to
do'
asked
frodo


'i
think'
answered
strider
slowly
as
if
he
was
not
quite
sure
'i
think
the
best
thing
is
to
go
as
straight
eastward
from
here
as
we
can
to
make
for
the
line
of
hills
not
for
weathertop
there
we
can
strike
a
path
I
know
that
runs
at
their
feet
it
will
bring
us
to
weathertop
from
the
north
and
less
openly
then
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see'

all
that
day
they
plodded
along
until
the
cold
and
early
evening
came
down
the
land
became
drier
and
more
barren
but
mists
and
vapours
lay
behind
them
on
the
marshes
a
few
melancholy
birds
were
piping
and
wailing
until
the
round
red
sun
sank
slowly
into
the
western
shadows
then
an
empty
silence
fell
the
hobbits
thought
of
the
soft
light
of
sunset
glancing
through
the
cheerful
windows
of
bag
end
far
away

at
the
day's
end
they
came
to
a
stream
that
wandered
down
from
the
hills
to
lose
itself
in
the
stagnant
marshland
and
they
went
up
along
its
banks
while
the
light
lasted
it
was
already
night
when
at
last
they
halted
and
made
their
camp
under
some
stunted
aldertrees
by
the
shores
of
the
stream
ahead
there
loomed
now
against
the
dusky
sky
the
bleak
and
treeless
backs
of
the
hills
that
night
they
set
a
watch
and
strider
it
seemed
did
not
sleep
at
all
the
moon
was
waxing
and
in
the
early
nighthours
a
cold
grey
light
lay
on
the
land

next
morning
they
set
out
again
soon
after
sunrise
there
was
a
frost
in
the
air
and
the
sky
was
a
pale
clear
blue
the
hobbits
felt
refreshed
as
if
they
had
had
a
night
of
unbroken
sleep
already
they
were
getting
used
to
much
walking
on
short
commons

shorter
at
any
rate
than
what
in
the
shire
they
would
have
thought
barely
enough
to
keep
them
on
their
legs
pippin
declared
that
frodo
was
looking
twice
the
hobbit
that
he
had
been

'very
odd'
said
frodo
tightening
his
belt
'considering
that
there
is
actually
a
good
deal
less
of
me
I
hope
the
thinning
process
will
not
go
on
indefinitely
or
I
shall
become
a
wraith'

'do
not
speak
of
such
things'
said
strider
quickly
and
with
surprising
earnestness

the
hills
drew
nearer
they
made
an
undulating
ridge
often
rising
almost
to
a
thousand
feet
and
here
and
there
falling
again
to
low
clefts
or
passes
leading
into
the
eastern
land
beyond
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
the
hobbits
could
see
what
looked
to
be
the
remains
of
greengrown
walls
and
dikes
and
in
the
clefts
there
still
stood
the
ruins
of
old
works
of
stone
by
night
they
had
reached
the
feet
of
the
westward
slopes
and
there
they
camped
it
was
the
night
of
the
fifth
of
october
and
they
were
six
days
out
from
bree

in
the
morning
they
found
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
left
the
chetwood
a
track
plain
to
see
they
turned
right
and
followed
it
southwards
it
ran
cunningly
taking
a
line
that
seemed
chosen
so
as
to
keep
as
much
hidden
as
possible
from
the
view
both
of
the
hilltops
above
and
of
the
flats
to
the
west
it
dived
into
dells
and
hugged
steep
banks
and
where
it
passed
over
flatter
and
more
open
ground
on
either
side
of
it
there
were
lines
of
large
boulders
and
hewn
stones
that
screened
the
travellers
almost
like
a
hedge

'i
wonder
who
made
this
path
and
what
for'
said
merry
as
they
walked
along
one
of
these
avenues
where
the
stones
were
unusually
large
and
closely
set
'i
am
not
sure
that
I
like
it
it
has
a


well
rather
a
barrowwightish
look
is
there
any
barrow
on
weathertop'

'no
there
is
no
barrow
on
weathertop
nor
on
any
of
these
hills'
answered
strider
'the
men
of
the
west
did
not
live
here
though
in
their
latter
days
they
defended
the
hills
for
a
while
against
the
evil
that
came
out
of
angmar
this
path
was
made
to
serve
the
forts
along
the
walls
but
long
before
in
the
first
days
of
the
north
kingdom
they
built
a
great
watchtower
on
weathertop
amon
sl
they
called
it
it
was
burned
and
broken
and
nothing
remains
of
it
now
but
a
tumbled
ring
like
a
rough
crown
on
the
old
hill's
head
yet
once
it
was
tall
and
fair
it
is
told
that
elendil
stood
there
watching
for
the
coming
of
gilgalad
out
of
the
west
in
the
days
of
the
last
alliance'

the
hobbits
gazed
at
strider
it
seemed
that
he
was
learned
in
old
lore
as
well
as
in
the
ways
of
the
wild
'who
was
gilgalad'
asked
merry
but
strider
did
not
answer
and
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
suddenly
a
low
voice
murmured


gilgalad
was
an
elvenking

of
him
the
harpers
sadly
sing

the
last
whose
realm
was
fair
and
free

between
the
mountains
and
the
sea


his
sword
was
long
his
lance
was
keen

his
shining
helm
afar
was
seen

the
countless
stars
of
heaven's
field

were
mirrored
in
his
silver
shield

but
long
ago
he
rode
away

and
where
he
dwelleth
none
can
say

for
into
darkness
fell
his
star

in
mordor
where
the
shadows
are

the
others
turned
in
amazement
for
the
voice
was
sam's

'don't
stop'
said
merry

'that's
all
I
know'
stammered
sam
blushing
'i
learned
it
from
mr
bilbo
when
I
was
a
lad
he
used
to
tell
me
tales
like
that
knowing
how
I
was
always
one
for
hearing
about
elves
it
was
mr
bilbo
as
taught
me
my
letters
he
was
mighty
booklearned
was
dear
old
mr
bilbo
and
he
wrote

poetry

he
wrote
what
I
have
just
said'

'he
did
not
make
it
up'
said
strider
'it
is
pan
of
the
lay
that
is
called

the
fall
of
gilgalad

which
is
in
an
ancient
tongue
bilbo
must
have
translated
it
I
never
knew
that'

'there
was
a
lot
more'
said
sam
'all
about
mordor
I
didn't
learn
that
part
it
gave
me
the
shivers
I
never
thought
I
should
be
going
that
way
myself'

'going
to
mordor'
cried
pippin
'i
hope
it
won't
come
to
that'

'do
not
speak
that
name
so
loudly'
said
strider

it
was
already
midday
when
they
drew
near
the
southern
end
of
the
path
and
saw
before
them
in
the
pale
clear
light
of
the
october
sun
a
greygreen
bank
leading
up
like
a
bridge
on
to
the
northward
slope
of
the
hill
they
decided
to
make
for
the
top
at
once
while
the
daylight
was
broad
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
and
they
could
only
hope
that
no
enemy
or
spy
was
observing
them
nothing
was
to
be
seen
moving
on
the
hill
if
gandalf
was
anywhere
about
there
was
no
sign
of
him

on
the
western
flank
of
weathertop
they
found
a
sheltered
hollow
at
the
bottom
of
which
there
was
a
bowlshaped
dell
with
grassy
sides
there
they
left
sam
and
pippin
with
the
pony
and
their
packs
and
luggage
the
other
three
went
on
after
half
an
hour's
plodding
climb
strider
reached
the
crown
of
the
hill
frodo
and
merry
followed
tired
and
breathless
the
last
slope
had
been
steep
and
rocky

on
the
top
they
found
as
strider
had
said
a
wide
ring
of
ancient
stonework
now
crumbling
or
covered
with
agelong
grass
but
in
the
centre
a
cairn
of
broken
stones
had
been
piled
they
were
blackened
as
if
with
fire
about
them
the
turf
was
burned
to
the
roots
and
all
within
the
ring
the
grass
was
scorched
and
shrivelled
as
if
flames
had
swept
the
hilltop
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
thing

standing
upon
the
rim
of
the
ruined
circle
they
saw
all
round
below
them
a
wide
prospect
for
the
most
pan
of
lands
empty
and
featureless
except
for
patches
of
woodland
away
to
the
south
beyond
which
they
caught
here
and
there
the
glint
of
distant
water
beneath
them
on
this
southern
side
there
ran
like
a
ribbon
the
old
road
coming
out
of
the
west
and
winding
up
and
down
until
it
faded
behind
a
ridge
of
dark
land
to
the
east
nothing
was
moving
on
it
following
its
line
eastward
with
their
eyes
they
saw
the
mountains
the
nearer
foothills
were
brown
and
sombre

behind
them
stood
taller
shapes
of
grey
and
behind
those
again
were
high
white
peaks
glimmering
among
the
clouds

'well
here
we
are'
said
merry
'and
very
cheerless
and
uninviting
it
looks
there
is
no
water
and
no
shelter
and
no
sign
of
gandalf
but
I
don't
blame
him
for
not
waiting

if
he
ever
came
here'

'i
wonder'
said
strider
looking
round
thoughtfully
'even
if
he
was
a
day
or
two
behind
us
at
bree
he
could
have
arrived
here
first
he
can
ride
very
swiftly
when
need
presses'
suddenly
he
stooped
and
looked
at
the
stone
on
the
top
of
the
cairn
it
was
flatter
than
the
others
and
whiter
as
if
it
had
escaped
the
fire
he
picked
it
up
and
examined
it
turning
it
in
his
fingers
this
has
been
handled
recently'
he
said
'what
do
you
think
of
these
marks'

on
the
flat
underside
frodo
saw
some
scratches
'there
seems
to
he
a
stroke
a
dot
and
three
more
strokes'
he
said

'the
stroke
on
the
left
might
be
a
grune
with
thin
branches'
said
strider
'it
might
be
a
sign
left
by
gandalf
though
one
cannot
be
sure
the
scratches
are
fine
and
they
certainly
look
fresh
but
the
marks
might
mean
something
quite
different
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
rangers
use
runes
and
they
come
here
sometimes'

'what
could
they
mean
even
if
gandalf
made
them'
asked
merry

'i
should
say'
answered
strider
'that
they
stood
for
g3
and
were
a
sign
that
gandalf
was
here
on
october
the
third
that
is
three
days
ago
now
it
would
also
show
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
danger
was
at
hand
so
that
he
had
no
time
or
did
not
dare
to
write
anything
longer
or
plainer
if
that
is
so
we
must
be
wary'

'i
wish
we
could
feel
sure
that
he
made
the
marks
whatever
they
may
mean'
said
frodo
'it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
know
that
he
was
on
the
way
in
front
of
us
or
behind
us'

'perhaps'
said
strider
'for
myself
I
believe
that
he
was
here
and
was
in
danger
there
have
been
scorching
flames
here
and
now
the
light
that
we
saw
three
nights
ago
in
the
eastern
sky
comes
back
to
my
mind
I
guess
that
he
was
attacked
on
this
hilltop
but
with
what
result
I
cannot
tell
he
is
here
no
longer
and
we
must
now
look
after
ourselves
and
make
our
own
way
to
rivendell
as
best
we
can
'

'how
far
is
rivendell'
asked
merry
gazing
round
wearily
the
world
looked
wild
and
wide
from
weathertop

'i
don't
know
if
the
road
has
ever
been
measured
in
miles
beyond
the

forsaken
inn

a
day's
journey
east
of
bree'
answered
strider
'some
say
it
is
so
far
and
some
say
otherwise
it
is
a
strange
road
and
folk
are
glad
to
reach
their
journey's
end
whether
the
time
is
long
or
short
but
I
know
how
long
it
would
take
me
on
my
own
feet
with
fair
weather
and
no
ill
fortune
twelve
days
from
here
to
the
ford
of
bruinen
where
the
road
crosses
the
loudwater
that
runs
out
of
rivendell
we
have
at
least
a
fortnight's
journey
before
us
for
I
do
not
think
we
shall
be
able
to
use
the
road'

'a
fortnight'
said
frodo
'a
lot
may
happen
in
that
time'

'it
may'
said
strider

they
stood
for
a
while
silent
on
the
hilltop
near
its
southward
edge
in
that
lonely
place
frodo
for
the
first
time
fully
realized
his
homelessness
and
danger
he
wished
bitterly
that
his
fortune
had
left
him
in
the
quiet
and
beloved
shire
he
stared
down
at
the
hateful
road
leading
back
westward


to
his
home
suddenly
he
was
aware
that
two
black
specks
were
moving
slowly
along
it
going
westward
and
looking
again
he
saw
that
three
others
were
creeping
eastward
to
meet
them
he
gave
a
cry
and
clutched
strider's
arm

'look'
he
said
pointing
downwards
at
once
strider
flung
himself
on
the
ground
behind
the
ruined
circle
pulling
frodo
down
beside
him
merry
threw
himself
alongside
'what
is
it'
he
whispered


'i
do
not
know
but
I
fear
the
worst'
answered
strider

slowly
they
crawled
up
to
the
edge
of
the
ring
again
and
peered
through
a
cleft
between
two
jagged
stones
the
light
was
no
longer
bright
for
the
clear
morning
had
faded
and
clouds
creeping
out
of
the
east
had
now
overtaken
the
sun
as
it
began
to
go
down
they
could
all
see
the
black
specks
but
neither
frodo
nor
merry
could
make
out
their
shapes
for
certain
yet
something
told
them
that
there
far
below
were
black
riders
assembling
on
the
road
beyond
the
foot
of
the
hill

'yes'
said
strider
whose
keener
sight
left
him
in
no
doubt
'the
enemy
is
here'

hastily
they
crept
away
and
slipped
down
the
north
side
of
the
hill
to
find
their
companions

sam
and
peregrin
had
not
been
idle
they
had
explored
the
small
dell
and
the
surrounding
slopes
not
far
away
they
found
a
spring
of
clear
water
in
the
hillside
and
near
it
footprints
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
old
in
the
dell
itself
they
found
recent
traces
of
a
fire
and
other
signs
of
a
hasty
camp
there
were
some
fallen
rocks
on
the
edge
of
the
dell
nearest
to
the
hill
behind
them
sam
came
upon
a
small
store
of
firewood
neatly
stacked

'i
wonder
if
old
gandalf
has
been
here'
he
said
to
pippin
'whoever
it
was
put
this
stuff
here
meant
to
come
back
it
seems'

strider
was
greatly
interested
in
these
discoveries
'i
wish
I
had
waited
and
explored
the
ground
down
here
myself'
he
said
hurrying
off
to
the
spring
to
examine
the
footprints

'it
is
just
as
I
feared'
he
said
when
he
came
back
'sam
and
pippin
have
trampled
the
soft
ground
and
the
marks
are
spoilt
or
confused
rangers
have
been
here
lately
it
is
they
who
left
the
firewood
behind
but
there
are
also
several
newer
tracks
that
were
not
made
by
rangers
at
least
one
set
was
made
only
a
day
or
two
ago
by
heavy
boots
at
least
one
I
cannot
now
be
certain
but
I
think
there
were
many
booted
feet'
he
paused
and
stood
in
anxious
thought

each
of
the
hobbits
saw
in
his
mind
a
vision
of
the
cloaked
and
booted
riders
if
the
horsemen
had
already
found
the
dell
the
sooner
strider
led
them
somewhere
else
the
better
sam
viewed
the
hollow
with
great
dislike
now
that
he
had
heard
news
of
their
enemies
on
the
road
only
a
few
miles
away

'hadn't
we
better
clear
out
quick
mr
strider'
he
asked
impatiently
'it
is
getting
late
and
I
don't
like
this
hole
it
makes
my
heart
sink
somehow'

'yes
we
certainly
must
decide
what
to
do
at
once'
answered
strider
looking
up
and
considering
the
time
and
the
weather
'well
sam'
he
said
at
last
'i
do
not
like
this
place
either
but
I
cannot
think
of
anywhere
better
that
we
could
reach
before
nightfall
at
least
we
are
out
of
sight
for
the
moment
and
if
we
moved
we
should
be
much
more
likely
to
be
seen
by
spies
all
we
could
do
would
be
to
go
right
out
of
our
way
back
north
on
this
side
of
the
line
of
hills
where
the
land
is
all
much
the
same
as
it
is
here
the
road
is
watched
but
we
should
have
to
cross
it
if
we
tried
to
take
cover
in
the
thickets
away
to
the
south
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
beyond
the
hills
the
country
is
bare
and
flat
for
miles'

'can
the
riders

see'

asked
merry
'i
mean
they
seem
usually
to
have
used
their
noses
rather
than
their
eyes
smelling
for
us
if
smelling
is
the
right
word
at
least
in
the
daylight
but
you
made
us
lie
down
flat
when
you
saw
them
down
below
and
now
you
talk
of
being
seen
if
we
move'

'i
was
too
careless
on
the
hilltop'
answered
strider
'i
was
very
anxious
to
find
some
sign
of
gandalf
but
it
was
a
mistake
for
three
of
us
to
go
up
and
stand
there
so
long
for
the
black
horses
can
see
and
the
riders
can
use
men
and
other
creatures
as
spies
as
we
found
at
bree
they
themselves
do
not
see
the
world
of
light
as
we
do
but
our
shapes
cast
shadows
in
their
minds
which
only
the
noon
sun
destroys
and
in
the
dark
they
perceive
many
signs
and
forms
that
are
hidden
from
us
then
they
are
most
to
be
feared
and
at
all
times
they
smell
the
blood
of
living
things
desiring
and
hating
it
senses
too
there
are
other
than
sight
or
smell
we
can
feel
their
presence

it
troubled
our
hearts
as
soon
as
we
came
here
and
before
we
saw
them
they
feel
ours
more
keenly
also'
he
added
and
his
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
'the
ring
draws
them'


'is
there
no
escape
then'
said
frodo
looking
round
wildly
'if
I
move
I
shall
be
seen
and
hunted
if
I
stay
I
shall
draw
them
to
me'

strider
laid
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
'there
is
still
hope'
he
said
'you
are
not
alone
let
us
take
this
wood
that
is
set
ready
for
the
fire
as
a
sign
there
is
little
shelter
or
defence
here
but
fire
shall
serve
for
both
sauron
can
put
fire
to
his
evil
uses
as
he
can
all
things
but
these
riders
do
not
love
it
and
fear
those
who
wield
it
fire
is
our
friend
in
the
wilderness'

'maybe'
muttered
sam
'it
is
also
as
good
a
way
of
saying
here
we
are
as
I
can
think
of
bar
shouting'

down
in
the
lowest
and
most
sheltered
corner
of
the
dell
they
lit
a
fire
and
prepared
a
meal
the
shades
of
evening
began
to
fall
and
it
grew
cold
they
were
suddenly
aware
of
great
hunger
for
they
had
not
eaten
anything
since
breakfast
but
they
dared
not
make
more
than
a
frugal
supper
the
lands
ahead
were
empty
of
all
save
birds
and
beasts
unfriendly
places
deserted
by
all
the
races
of
the
world
rangers
passed
at
times
beyond
the
hills
but
they
were
few
and
did
not
stay
other
wanderers
were
rare
and
of
evil
sort
trolls
might
stray
down
at
times
out
of
the
northern
valleys
of
the
misty
mountains
only
on
the
road
would
travellers
be
found
most
often
dwarves
hurrying
along
on
business
of
their
own
and
with
no
help
and
few
words
to
spare
for
strangers

'i
don't
see
how
our
food
can
be
made
to
last'
said
frodo
'we
have
been
careful
enough
in
the
last
few
days
and
this
supper
is
no
feast
but
we
have
used
more
than
we
ought
if
we
have
two
weeks
still
to
go
and
perhaps
more'

'there
is
food
in
the
wild'
said
strider
'berry
root
and
herb
and
I
have
some
skill
as
a
hunter
at
need
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
starving
before
winter
comes
but
gathering
and
catching
food
is
long
and
weary
work
and
we
need
haste
so
tighten
your
belts
and
think
with
hope
of
the
tables
of
elrond's
house'

the
cold
increased
as
darkness
came
on
peering
out
from
the
edge
of
the
dell
they
could
see
nothing
but
a
grey
land
now
vanishing
quickly
into
shadow
the
sky
above
had
cleared
again
and
was
slowly
filled
with
twinkling
stars
frodo
and
his
companions
huddled
round
the
fire
wrapped
in
every
garment
and
blanket
they
possessed
but
strider
was
content
with
a
single
cloak
and
sat
a
little
apart
drawing
thoughtfully
at
his
pipe

as
night
fell
and
the
light
of
the
fire
began
to
shine
out
brightly
he
began
to
tell
them
tales
to
keep
their
minds
from
fear
he
knew
many
histories
and
legends
of
long
ago
of
elves
and
men
and
the
good
and
evil
deeds
of
the
elder
days
they
wondered
how
old
he
was
and
where
he
had
learned
all
this
lore

'tell
us
of
gilgalad'
said
merry
suddenly
when
he
paused
at
the
end
of
a
story
of
the
elfkingdoms
'do
you
know
any
more
of
that
old
lay
that
you
spoke
of'

'i
do
indeed'
answered
strider
'so
also
does
frodo
for
it
concerns
us
closely'
merry
and
pippin
looked
at
frodo
who
was
staring
into
the
fire

'i
know
only
the
little
that
gandalf
has
told
me'
said
frodo
slowly
'gilgalad
was
the
last
of
the
great
elfkings
of
middleearth
gilgalad
is

starlight

in
their
tongue
with
elendil
the
elffriend
he
went
to
the
land
of'

'no'
said
strider
interrupting
'i
do
not
think
that
tale
should
be
told
now
with
the
servants
of
the
enemy
at
hand
if
we
win
through
to
the
house
of
elrond
you
may
hear
it
there
told
in
full'

'then
tell
us
some
other
tale
of
the
old
days'
begged
sam
'a
tale
about
the
elves
before
the
fading
time
I
would
dearly
like
to
hear
more
about
elves
the
dark
seems
to
press
round
so
close'

'i
will
tell
you
the
tale
of
tinviel'
said
strider
'in
brief

for
it
is
a
long
tale
of
which
the
end
is
not
known
and
there
are
none
now
except
elrond
that
remember
it
aright
as
it
was
told
of
old
it
is
a
fair
tale
though
it
is
sad
as
are
all
the
tales
of
middleearth
and
yet
it
may
lift
up
your
hearts'
he
was
silent
for
some
time
and
then
he
began
not
to
speak
but
to
chant
softly

the
leaves
were
long
the
grass
was
green

the
hemlockumbels
tall
and
fair



and
in
the
glade
a
light
was
seen
of
stars
in
shadow
shimmering
tinviel
was
dancing
there
to
music
of
a
pipe
unseen
and
light
of
stars
was
in
her
hair
and
in
her
raiment
glimmering

there
beren
came
from
mountains
cold
and
lost
he
wandered
under
leaves
and
where
the
elvenriver
rolled
he
walked
alone
and
sorrowing
he
peered
between
the
hemlockleaves
and
saw
in
wander
flowers
of
gold
upon
her
mantle
and
her
sleeves
and
her
hair
like
shadow
following

enchantment
healed
his
weary
feet

that
over
hills
were
doomed
to
roam
and
forth
he
hastened
strong
and
fleet
and
grasped
at
moonbeams
glistening

through
woven
woods
in
elvenhome
she
tightly
fled
on
dancing
feet
and
left
him
lonely
still
to
roam
in
the
silent
forest
listening

he
heard
there
oft
the
flying
sound
of
feet
as
light
as
lindenleaves
or
music
welling
underground
in
hidden
hollows
quavering
now
withered
lay
the
hemlocksheaves
and
one
by
one
with
sighing
sound
whispering
fell
the
beechen
leaves
in
the
wintry
woodland
wavering

he
sought
her
ever
wandering
far
where
leaves
of
years
were
thickly
strewn
by
light
of
moon
and
ray
of
star
in
frosty
heavens
shivering
her
mantle
glinted
in
the
moon
as
on
a
hilltop
high
and
far
she
danced
and
at
her
feet
was
strewn
a
mist
of
silver
quivering

when
winter
passed
she
came
again
and
her
song
released
the
sudden
spring
like
rising
lark
and
falling
rain
and
melting
water
bubbling
he
saw
the
elvenflowers
spring
about
her
feet
and
healed
again
he
longed
by
her
to
dance
and
sing


upon
the
grass
untroubling

again
she
fled
but
swift
he
came

tinviel
tinviel

he
called
her
by
her
elvish
name

and
there
she
halted
listening

one
moment
stood
she
and
a
spell

his
voice
laid
on
her
beren
came

and
doom
fell
on
tinviel

that
in
his
arms
lay
glistening


as
beren
looked
into
her
eyes

within
the
shadows
of
her
hair

the
trembling
starlight
of
the
skies

he
saw
there
mirrored
shimmering

tinviel
the
elvenfair

immortal
maiden
elvenwise

about
him
cast
her
shadowy
hair

and
arms
like
silver
glimmering


long
was
the
way
that
fate
them
bore

o'er
stony
mountains
cold
and
grey

through
halls
of
iron
and
darkling
door

and
woods
of
nightshade
morrowless

the
sundering
seas
between
them
lay

and
yet
at
last
they
met
once
more

and
long
ago
they
passed
away

in
the
forest
singing
sorrowless


strider
sighed
and
paused
before
he
spoke
again
'that
is
a
song'
he
said
'in
the
mode
that
is
called

annthennath

among
the
elves
but
is
hard
to
render
in
our
common
speech
and
this
is
but
a
rough
echo
of
it
it
tells
of
the
meeting
of
beren
son
of
barahir
and
lthien
tinviel
beren
was
a
mortal
man
but
lthien
was
the
daughter
of
thingol
a
king
of
elves
upon
middleearth
when
the
world
was
young
and
she
was
the
fairest
maiden
that
has
ever
been
among
all
the
children
of
this
world
as
the
stars
above
the
mists
of
the
northern
lands
was
her
loveliness
and
in
her
face
was
a
shining
light
in
those
days
the
great
enemy
of
whom
sauron
of
mordor
was
but
a
servant
dwelt
in
angband
in
the
north
and
the
elves
of
the
west
coming
back
to
middleearth
made
war
upon
him
to
regain
the
silmarils
which
he
had
stolen
and
the
fathers
of
men
aided
the
elves
but
the
enemy
was
victorious
and
barahir
was
slain
and
beren
escaping
through
great
peril
came
over
the
mountains
of
terror
into
the
hidden
kingdom
of
thingol
in
the
forest
of
neldoreth
there
he
beheld
lthien
singing
and
dancing
in
a
glade
beside
the
enchanted
river
esgalduin
and
he
named
her
tinviel
that
is
nightingale
in
the
language
of
old
many
sorrows
befell
them
afterwards
and
they
were
parted
long
tinviel
rescued
beren
from
the
dungeons
of
sauron
and
together
they
passed
through
great
dangers
and
cast
down
even
the
great
enemy
from
his
throne
and
took
from
his
iron
crown
one
of
the
three
silmarils
brightest
of
all
jewels
to
be
the
brideprice
of
lthien
to
thingol
her
father
yet
at
the
last
beren
was
slain
by
the
wolf
that
came
from
the
gates
of
angband
and
he
died
in
the
arms
of
tinviel
but
she
chose
mortality
and
to
die
from
the
world
so
that
she
might
follow
him
and
it
is
sung
that
they
met
again
beyond
the
sundering
seas
and
after
a
brief
time
walking
alive
once
more
in
the
green
woods
together
they
passed
long
ago
beyond
the
confines
of
this
world
so
it
is
that
lthien
tinviel
alone
of
the
elfkindred
has
died
indeed
and
left
the
world
and
they
have
lost
her
whom
they
most
loved
but
from
her
the
lineage
of
the
elflords
of
old
descended
among
men
there
live
still
those
of
whom
lthien
was
the
foremother
and
it
is
said
that
her
line
shall
never
fail
elrond
of
rivendell
is
of
that
kin
for
of
beren
and
lthien
was
born
dior
thingol's
heir
and
of
him
elwing
the
white
whom
erendil
wedded
he
that
sailed
his
ship
out
of
the
mists
of
the
world
into
the
seas
of
heaven
with
the
silmaril
upon
his
brow
and
of
erendil
came
the
kings
of
nmenor
that
is
westernesse'

as
strider
was
speaking
they
watched
his
strange
eager
face
dimly
lit
in
the
red
glow
of
the
woodfire
his
eyes
shone
and
his
voice
was
rich
and
deep
above
him
was
a
black
starry
sky
suddenly
a
pale
light
appeared
over
the
crown
of
weathertop
behind
him
the
waxing
moon
was
climbing
slowly
above
the
hill
that
overshadowed
them
and
the
stars
above
the
hilltop
faded

the
story
ended
the
hobbits
moved
and
stretched
'look'
said
merry
'the
moon
is
rising
it
must
be
getting
late'

the
others
looked
up
even
as
they
did
so
they
saw
on
the
top
of
the
hill
something
small
and
dark
against
the
glimmer
of
the
moonrise
it
was
perhaps
only
a
large
stone
or
jutting
rock
shown
up
by
the
pale
light

sam
and
merry
got
up
and
walked
away
from
the
fire
frodo
and
pippin
remained
seated
in
silence
strider
was
watching
the
moonlight
on
the
hill
intently
all
seemed
quiet
and
still
but
frodo
felt
a
cold
dread
creeping
over
his
heart
now
that
strider
was
no
longer
speaking
he
huddled
closer
to
the
fire
at
that
moment
sam
came
running
back
from
the
edge
of
the
dell

'i
don't
know
what
it
is'
he
said
'but
I
suddenly
felt
afraid
I
durstn't
go
outside
this
dell
for
any
money
I
felt
that
something
was
creeping
up
the
slope'

'did
you

see

anything'
asked
frodo
springing
to
his
feet

'no
sir
I
saw
nothing
but
I
didn't
stop
to
look'

'i
saw
something'
said
merry
'or
I
thought
I
did

away
westwards
where
the
moonlight
was
falling
on
the
flats
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
hilltops
I

thought

there
were
two
or
three
black
shapes
they
seemed
to
be
moving
this
way'

'keep
close
to
the
fire
with
your
faces
outward'
cried
strider
'get
some
of
the
longer
sticks
ready
in
your
hands'

for
a
breathless
time
they
sat
there
silent
and
alert
with
their
backs
turned
to
the
woodfire
each
gazing
into
the
shadows
that
encircled
them
nothing
happened
there
was
no
sound
or
movement
in
the
night
frodo
stirred
feeling
that
he
must
break
the
silence
he
longed
to
shout
out
aloud

'hush'
whispered
strider
'what's
that'
gasped
pippin
at
the
same
moment

over
the
lip
of
the
little
dell
on
the
side
away
from
the
hill
they
felt
rather
than
saw
a
shadow
rise
one
shadow
or
more
than
one
they
strained
their
eyes
and
the
shadows
seemed
to
grow
soon
there
could
be
no
doubt

three
or
four
tall
black
figures
were
standing
there
on
the
slope
looking
down
on
them
so
black
were
they
that
they
seemed
like
black
holes
in
the
deep
shade
behind
them
frodo
thought
that
he
heard
a
faint
hiss
as
of
venomous
breath
and
felt
a
thin
piercing
chill
then
the
shapes
slowly
advanced

terror
overcame
pippin
and
merry
and
they
threw
themselves
flat
on
the
ground
sam
shrank
to
frodo's
side
frodo
was
hardly
less
terrified
than
his
companions
he
was
quaking
as
if
he
was
bitter
cold
but
his
terror
was
swallowed
up
in
a
sudden
temptation
to
put
on
the
ring
the
desire
to
do
this
laid
hold
of
him
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
he
did
not
forget
the
barrow
nor
the
message
of
gandalf
but
something
seemed
to
be
compelling
him
to
disregard
all
warnings
and
he
longed
to
yield
not
with
the
hope
of
escape
or
of
doing
anything
either
good
or
bad
he
simply
felt
that
he
must
take
the
ring
and
put
it
on
his
finger
he
could
not
speak
he
felt
sam
looking
at
him
as
if
he
knew
that
his
master
was
in
some
great
trouble
but
he
could
not
turn
towards
him
he
shut
his
eyes
and
struggled
for
a
while
but
resistance
became
unbearable
and
at
last
he
slowly
drew
out
the
chain
and
slipped
the
ring
on
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand


immediately
though
everything
else
remained
as
before
dim
and
dark
the
shapes
became
terribly
clear
he
was
able
to
see
beneath
their
black
wrappings
there
were
five
tall
figures
two
standing
on
the
lip
of
the
dell
three
advancing
in
their
white
faces
burned
keen
and
merciless
eyes
under
their
mantles
were
long
grey
robes
upon
their
grey
hairs
were
helms
of
silver
in
their
haggard
hands
were
swords
of
steel
their
eyes
fell
on
him
and
pierced
him
as
they
rushed
towards
him
desperate
he
drew
his
own
sword
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
flickered
red
as
if
it
was
a
firebrand
two
of
the
figures
halted
the
third
was
taller
than
the
others
his
hair
was
long
and
gleaming
and
on
his
helm
was
a
crown
in
one
hand
he
held
a
long
sword
and
in
the
other
a
knife
both
the
knife
and
the
hand
that
held
it
glowed
with
a
pale
light
he
sprang
forward
and
bore
down
on
frodo

at
that
moment
frodo
threw
himself
forward
on
the
ground
and
he
heard
himself
crying
aloud
o

elbereth
gilthoniel

at
the
same
time
he
struck
at
the
feet
of
his
enemy
a
shrill
cry
rang
out
in
the
night
and
he
felt
a
pain
like
a
dart
of
poisoned
ice
pierce
his
left
shoulder
even
as
he
swooned
he
caught
as
through
a
swirling
mist
a
glimpse
of
strider
leaping
out
of
the
darkness
with
a
flaming
brand
of
wood
in
either
hand
with
a
last
effort
frodo
dropping
his
sword
slipped
the
ring
from
his
finger
and
closed
his
right
hand
tight
upon
it


chapter
12


flight
to
the
ford


when
frodo
came
to
himself
he
was
still
clutching
the
ring
desperately
he
was
lying
by
the
fire
which
was
now
piled
high
and
burning
brightly
his
three
companions
were
bending
over
him
'what
has
happened
where
is
the
pale
king'
he
asked
wildly
they
were
too
overjoyed
to
hear
him
speak
to
answer
for
a
while
nor
did
they
understand
his
question
at
length
he
gathered
from
sam
that
they
had
seen
nothing
but
the
vague
shadowy
shapes
coming
towards
them
suddenly
to
his
horror
sam
found
that
his
master
had
vanished
and
at
that
moment
a
black
shadow
rushed
past
him
and
he
fell
he
heard
frodo's
voice
but
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
great
distance
or
from
under
the
earth
crying
out
strange
words
they
saw
nothing
more
until
they
stumbled
over
the
body
of
frodo
lying
as
if
dead
face
downwards
on
the
grass
with
his
sword
beneath
him
strider
ordered
them
to
pick
him
up
and
lay
him
near
the
fire
and
then
he
disappeared
that
was
now
a
good
while
ago

sam
plainly
was
beginning
to
have
doubts
again
about
strider
but
while
they
were
talking
he
returned
appearing
suddenly
out
of
the
shadows
they
started
and
sam
drew
his
sword
and
stood
over
frodo
but
strider
knelt
down
swiftly
at
his
side

'i
am
not
a
black
rider
sam'
he
said
gently
'nor
in
league
with
them
I
have
been
trying
to
discover
something
of
their
movements
but
I
have
found
nothing
I
cannot
think
why
they
have
gone
and
do
not
attack
again
but
there
is
no
feeling
of
their
presence
anywhere
at
hand'

when
he
heard
what
frodo
had
to
tell
he
became
full
of
concern
and
shook
his
head
and
sighed
then
he
ordered
pippin
and
merry
to
heat
as
much
water
as
they
could
in
their
small
kettles
and
to
bathe
the
wound
with
it
'keep
the
fire
going
well
and
keep
frodo
warm'
he
said
then
he
got
up
and
walked
away
and
called
sam
to
him
'i
think
I
understand
things
better
now'
he
said
in
a
low
voice
'there
seem
only
to
have
been
five
of
the
enemy
why
they
were
not
all
here
I
don't
know
but
I
don't
think
they
expected
to
be
resisted
they
have
drawn
off
for
the
time
being
but
not
far
I
fear
they
will
come
again
another
night
if
we
cannot
escape
they
are
only
waiting
because
they
think
that
their
purpose
is
almost
accomplished
and
that
the
ring
cannot
fly
much
further
I
fear
sam
that
they
believe
your
master
has
a
deadly
wound
that
will
subdue
him
to
their
will
we
shall
see'
sam
choked
with
tears
'don't
despair'
said
strider
'you
must
trust
me
now
your
frodo
is
made
of
sterner
stuff
than
I
had
guessed
though
gandalf
hinted
that
it
might
prove
so
he
is
not
slain
and
I
think
he
will
resist
the
evil
power
of
the
wound
longer
than
his
enemies
expect
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
help
and
heal
him
guard
him
well
while
I
am
away'
he
hurried
off
and
disappeared
again
into
the
darkness

frodo
dozed
though
the
pain
of
his
wound
was
slowly
growing
and
a
deadly
chill
was
spreading
from
his
shoulder
to
his
arm
and
side
his
friends
watched
over
him
warming
him
and
bathing
his
wound
the
night
passed
slowly
and
wearily
dawn
was
growing
in
the
sky
and
the
dell
was
filling
with
grey
light
when
strider
at
last
returned

'look'
he
cried
and
stooping
he
lifted
from
the
ground
a
black
cloak
that
had
lain
there
hidden
by
the
darkness
a
foot
above
the
lower
hem
there
was
a
slash
'this
was
the
stroke
of
frodo's
sword'
he
said
'the
only
hurt
that
it
did
to
his
enemy
I
fear
for
it
is
unharmed
but
all
blades
perish
that
pierce
that
dreadful
king
more
deadly
to
him
was
the
name
of
elbereth'

'and
more
deadly
to
frodo
was
this'
he
stooped
again
and
lifted
up
a
long
thin
knife
there
was
a
cold
gleam
in
it
as
strider
raised
it
they
saw
that
near
the
end
its
edge
was
notched
and
the
point
was
broken
off
but
even
as
he
held
it
up
in
the
growing
light
they
gazed
in
astonishment
for
the
blade
seemed
to
melt
and
vanished
like
a
smoke
in
the
air
leaving
only
the
hilt
in
strider's
hand
'alas'
he
cried
'it
was
this
accursed
knife
that
gave
the
wound
few
now
have
the
skill
in
healing
to
match
such
evil
weapons
but
I
will
do
what
I
can'

he
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
taking
the
daggerhilt
laid
it
on
his
knees
and
he
sang
over
it
a
slow
song
in
a
strange
tongue
then
setting
it
aside
he
turned
to
frodo
and
in
a
soft
tone
spoke
words
the
others
could
not
catch
from
the
pouch
at
his
belt
he
drew
out
the
long
leaves
of
a
plant

'these
leaves'
he
said
'i
have
walked
far
to
find
for
this
plant
does
not
grow
in
the
bare
hills
but
in
the
thickets
away
south
of
the
road
I
found
it
in
the
dark
by
the
scent
of
its
leaves'
he
crushed
a
leaf
in
his
fingers
and
it
gave
out
a
sweet
and
pungent
fragrance
'it
is
fortunate
that
I
could
find
it
for
it
is
a
healing
plant
that
the
men
of
the
west
brought
to
middleearth

athelas

they
named
it
and
it
grows
now
sparsely
and
only
near
places
where
they
dwelt
or
camped
of
old
and
it
is
not
known
in
the
north
except
to
some
of
those
who
wander
in
the
wild
it
has
great
virtues
but
over
such
a
wound
as
this
its
healing
powers
may
be
small'

he
threw
the
leaves
into
boiling
water
and
bathed
frodo's
shoulder
the
fragrance
of
the
steam
was
refreshing
and
those
that
were
unhurt
felt
their
minds
calmed
and
cleared
the
herb
had
also
some
power
over
the
wound
for
frodo
felt
the
pain
and
also
the
sense
of
frozen
cold
lessen
in
his
side
but
the
life
did
not
return
to
his
arm
and
he
could
not
raise
or
use
his
hand
he
bitterly
regretted
his
foolishness
and
reproached
himself
for
weakness
of
will
for
he
now
perceived
that
in
putting
on
the
ring
he
obeyed
not
his
own
desire
but
the
commanding
wish
of
his
enemies
he
wondered
if
he
would
remain
maimed
for
life
and
how
they
would
now
manage
to
continue
their
journey
he
fell
too
weak
to
stand

the
others
were
discussing
this
very
question
they
quickly
decided
to
leave
weathertop
as
soon
as
possible
'i
think
now'
said
strider
'that
the
enemy
has
been
watching
this
place
for
some
days
if
gandalf
ever
came
here
then
he
must
have
been
forced
to
ride
away
and
he
will
not
return
in
any
case
we
are
in
great
peril
here
after
dark
since
the
attack
of
last
night
and
we
can
hardly
meet
greater
danger
wherever
we
go'

as
soon
as
the
daylight
was
full
they
had
some
hurried
food
and
packed
it
was
impossible
for
frodo
to
walk
so
they
divided
the
greater
part
of
their
baggage
among
the
four
of
them
and
put
frodo
on
the
pony
in
the
last
few
days
the
poor
beast
had
improved
wonderfully
it
already
seemed
fatter
and
stronger
and
had
begun
to
show
an
affection
for
its
new
masters
especially
for
sam
bill
ferny's
treatment
must
have
been
very
hard
for
the
journey
in
the
wild
to
seem
so
much
better
than
its
former
life

they
started
off
in
a
southerly
direction
this
would
mean
crossing
the
road
but
it
was
the
quickest
way
to
more
wooded
country
and
they
needed
fuel
for
strider
said
that
frodo
must
be
kept
warm
especially
at
night
while
fire
would
be
some
protection
for
them
all
it
was
also
his
plan
to
shorten
their
journey
by
cutting
across
another
great
loop
of
the
road
east
beyond
weathertop
it
changed
its
course
and
took
a
wide
bend
northwards


they
made
their
way
slowly
and
cautiously
round
the
southwestern
slopes
of
the
hill
and
came
in
a
little
while
to
the
edge
of
the
road
there
was
no
sign
of
the
riders
but
even
as
they
were
hurrying
across
they
heard
far
away
two
cries
a
cold
voice
calling
and
a
cold
voice
answering
trembling
they
sprang
forward
and
made
for
the
thickets
that
lay
ahead
the
land
before
them
sloped
away
southwards
but
it
was
wild
and
pathless
bushes
and
stunted
trees
grew
in
dense
patches
with
wide
barren
spaces
in
between
the
grass
was
scanty
coarse
and
grey
and
the
leaves
in
the
thickets
were
faded
and
falling
it
was
a
cheerless
land
and
their
journey
was
slow
and
gloomy
they
spoke
little
as
they
trudged
along
frodo's
heart
was
grieved
as
he
watched
them
walking
beside
him
with
their
heads
down
and
their
backs
bowed
under
their
burdens
even
strider
seemed
tired
and
heavyhearted

before
the
first
day's
march
was
over
frodo's
pain
began
to
grow
again
but
he
did
not
speak
of
it
for
a
long
time
four
days
passed
without
the
ground
or
the
scene
changing
much
except
that
behind
them
weathertop
slowly
sank
and
before
them
the
distant
mountains
loomed
a
little
nearer
yet
since
that
far
cry
they
had
seen
and
heard
no
sign
that
the
enemy
had
marked
their
flight
or
followed
them
they
dreaded
the
dark
hours
and
kept
watch
in
pairs
by
night
expecting
at
any
time
to
see
black
shapes
stalking
in
the
grey
night
dimly
lit
by
the
cloudveiled
moon
but
they
saw
nothing
and
heard
no
sound
but
the
sigh
of
withered
leaves
and
grass
not
once
did
they
feel
the
sense
of
present
evil
that
had
assailed
them
before
the
attack
in
the
dell
it
seemed
too
much
to
hope
that
the
riders
had
already
lost
their
trail
again
perhaps
they
were
waiting
to
make
some
ambush
in
a
narrow
place

at
the
end
of
the
fifth
day
the
ground
began
once
more
to
rise
slowly
out
of
the
wide
shallow
valley
into
which
they
had
descended
strider
now
turned
their
course
again
northeastwards
and
on
the
sixth
day
they
reached
the
top
of
a
long
slowclimbing
slope
and
saw
far
ahead
a
huddle
of
wooded
hills
away
below
them
they
could
see
the
road
sweeping
round
the
feet
of
the
hills
and
to
their
right
a
grey
river
gleamed
pale
in
the
thin
sunshine
in
the
distance
they
glimpsed
yet
another
river
in
a
stony
valley
halfveiled
in
mist

I
am
afraid
we
must
go
back
to
the
road
here
for
a
while'
said
strider
'we
have
now
come
to
the
river
hoarwell
that
the
elves
call
mitheithel
it
flows
down
out
of
the
ettenmoors
the
trollfells
north
of
rivendell
and
joins
the
loudwater
away
in
the
south
some
call
it
the
greyflood
after
that
it
is
a
great
water
before
it
finds
the
sea
there
is
no
way
over
it
below
its
sources
in
the
ettenmoors
except
by
the
last
bridge
on
which
the
road
crosses'

'what
is
that
other
river
we
can
see
far
away
there'
asked
merry

'that
is
loudwater
the
bruinen
of
rivendell'
answered
strider
'the
road
runs
along
the
edge
of
the
hills
for
many
miles
from
the
bridge
to
the
ford
of
bruinen
but
I
have
not
yet
thought
how
we
shall
cross
that
water
one
river
at
a
time
we
shall
be
fortunate
indeed
if
we
do
not
find
the
last
bridge
held
against
us'

next
day
early
in
the
morning
they
came
down
again
to
the
borders
of
the
road
sam
and
strider
went
forward
but
they
found
no
sign
of
any
travellers
or
riders
here
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills
there
had
been
some
rain
strider
judged
that
it
had
fallen
two
days
before
and
had
washed
away
all
footprints
no
horseman
had
passed
since
then
as
far
as
he
could
see

they
hurried
along
with
all
the
speed
they
could
make
and
after
a
mile
or
two
they
saw
the
last
bridge
ahead
at
the
bottom
of
a
short
steep
slope
they
dreaded
to
see
black
figures
waiting
there
but
they
saw
none
strider
made
them
take
cover
in
a
thicket
at
the
side
of
the
road
while
he
went
forward
to
explore

before
long
he
came
hurrying
back
'i
can
see
no
sign
of
the
enemy'
he
said
'and
I
wonder
very
much
what
that
means
but
I
have
found
something
very
strange'

he
held
out
his
hand
and
showed
a
single
palegreen
jewel
'i
found
it
in
the
mud
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge'
he
said
'it
is
a
beryl
an
elfstone
whether
it
was
set
there
or
let
fall
by
chance
I
cannot
say
but
it
brings
hope
to
me
I
will
take
it
as
a
sign
that
we
may
pass
the
bridge
but
beyond
that
I
dare
not
keep
to
the
road
without
some
clearer
token'


at
once
they
went
on
again
they
crossed
the
bridge
in
safety
hearing
no
sound
but
the
water
swirling
against
its
three
great
arches
a
mile
further
on
they
came
to
a
narrow
ravine
that
led
away
northwards
through
the
steep
lands
on
the
left
of
the
road
here
strider
turned
aside
and
soon
they
were
lost
in
a
sombre
country
of
dark
trees
winding
among
the
feet
of
sullen
hills

the
hobbits
were
glad
to
leave
the
cheerless
lands
and
the
perilous
road
behind
them
but
this
new
country
seemed
threatening
and
unfriendly
as
they
went
forward
the
hills
about
them
steadily
rose
here
and
there
upon
heights
and
ridges
they
caught
glimpses
of
ancient
walls
of
stone
and
the
ruins
of
towers
they
had
an
ominous
look
frodo
who
was
not
walking
had
time
to
gaze
ahead
and
to
think
he
recalled
bilbo's
account
of
his
journey
and
the
threatening
towers
on
the
hills
north
of
the
road
in
the
country
near
the
troll's
wood
where
his
first
serious
adventure
had
happened
frodo
guessed
that
they
were
now
in
the
same
region
and
wondered
if
by
chance
they
would
pass
near
the
spot

'who
lives
in
this
land'
he
asked
'and
who
built
these
towers
is
this
trollcountry'

'no'
said
strider
'trolls
do
not
build
no
one
lives
in
this
land
men
once
dwelt
here
ages
ago
but
none
remain
now
they
became
an
evil
people
as
legends
tell
for
they
fell
under
the
shadow
of
angmar
but
all
were
destroyed
in
the
war
that
brought
the
north
kingdom
to
its
end
but
that
is
now
so
long
ago
that
the
hills
have
forgotten
them
though
a
shadow
still
lies
on
the
land'

'where
did
you
learn
such
tales
if
all
the
land
is
empty
and
forgetful'
asked
peregrin
'the
birds
and
beasts
do
not
tell
tales
of
that
son'

'the
heirs
of
elendil
do
not
forget
all
things
past'
said
strider
'and
many
more
things
than
I
can
tell
are
remembered
in
rivendell'
'have
you
often
been
to
rivendell'
said
frodo
'i
have'
said
strider
'i
dwelt
there
once
and
still
I
return
when
I
may

there
my
heart
is
but
it
is
not
my
fate
to
sit
in
peace
even
in
the
fair
house
of
elrond'

the
hills
now
began
to
shut
them
in
the
road
behind
held
on
its
way
to
the
river
bruinen
but
both
were
now
hidden
from
view
the
travellers
came
into
a
long
valley
narrow
deeply
cloven
dark
and
silent
trees
with
old
and
twisted
roots
hung
over
cliffs
and
piled
up
behind
into
mounting
slopes
of
pinewood

the
hobbits
grew
very
weary
they
advanced
slowly
for
they
had
to
pick
their
way
through
a
pathless
country
encumbered
by
fallen
trees
and
tumbled
rocks
as
long
as
they
could
they
avoided
climbing
for
frodo's
sake
and
because
it
was
in
fact
difficult
to
find
any
way
up
out
of
the
narrow
dales
they
had
been
two
days
in
this
country
when
the
weather
turned
wet
the
wind
began
to
blow
steadily
out
of
the
west
and
pour
the
water
of
the
distant
seas
on
the
dark
heads
of
the
hills
in
fine
drenching
rain
by
nightfall
they
were
all
soaked
and
their
camp
was
cheerless
for
they
could
not
get
any
fire
to
burn
the
next
day
the
hills
rose
still
higher
and
steeper
before
them
and
they
were
forced
to
turn
away
northwards
out
of
their
course
strider
seemed
to
be
getting
anxious
they
were
nearly
ten
days
out
from
weathertop
and
their
stock
of
provisions
was
beginning
to
run
low
it
went
on
raining

that
night
they
camped
on
a
stony
shelf
with
a
rockwall
behind
them
in
which
there
was
a
shallow
cave
a
mere
scoop
in
the
cliff
frodo
was
restless
the
cold
and
wet
had
made
his
wound
more
painful
than
ever
and
the
ache
and
sense
of
deadly
chill
took
away
all
sleep
he
lay
tossing
and
turning
and
listening
fearfully
to
the
stealthy
nightnoises
wind
in
chinks
of
rock
water
dripping
a
crack
the
sudden
rattling
fall
of
a
loosened
stone
he
felt
that
black
shapes
were
advancing
to
smother
him
but
when
he
sat
up
he
saw
nothing
but
the
back
of
strider
sitting
hunched
up
smoking
his
pipe
and
watching
he
lay
down
again
and
passed
into
an
uneasy
dream
in
which
he
walked
on
the
grass
in
his
garden
in
the
shire
but
it
seemed
faint
and
dim
less
clear
than
the
tall
black
shadows
that
stood
looking
over
the
hedge

in
the
morning
he
woke
to
find
that
the
rain
had
stopped
the
clouds
were
still
thick
but
they
were
breaking
and
pale
strips
of
blue
appeared
between
them
the
wind
was
shifting
again
they
did
not
start
early
immediately
after
their
cold
and
comfortless
breakfast
strider
went
off
alone
telling
the
others
to
remain
under
the
shelter
of
the
cliff
until
he
came
back
he
was
going
to
climb
up
if
he
could
and
get
a
look
at
the
lie
of
the
land

when
he
returned
he
was
not
reassuring
'we
have
come
too
far
to
the
north'
he
said
'and
we
must
find
some
way
to
turn
back
southwards
again
if
we
keep
on
as
we
are
going
we
shall
get
up
into
the
ettendales
far
north
of
rivendell
that
is
trollcountry
and
little
known
to
me
we
could
perhaps
find
our
way
through
and
come
round
to
rivendell
from
the
north
but
it
would
take
too
long
for
I
do
not
know
the
way
and
our
food
would
not
last
so
somehow
or
other
we
must
find
the
ford
of
bruinen'

the
rest
of
that
day
they
spent
scrambling
over
rocky
ground
they
found
a
passage
between
two
hills
that
led
them
into
a
valley
running
southeast
the
direction
that
they
wished
to
take
but
towards
the
end
of
the
day
they
found
their
road
again
barred
by
a
ridge
of
high
land
its
dark
edge
against
the
sky
was
broken
into
many
bare
points
like
teeth
of
a
blunted
saw
they
had
a
choice
between
going
back
or
climbing
over
it

they
decided
to
attempt
the
climb
but
it
proved
very
difficult
before
long
frodo
was
obliged
to
dismount
and
struggle
along
on
foot
even
so
they
often
despaired
of
getting
their
pony
up
or
indeed
of
finding
a
path
for
themselves
burdened
as
they
were
the
light
was
nearly
gone
and
they
were
all
exhausted
when
at
last
they
reached
the
top
they
had
climbed
on
to
a
narrow
saddle
between
two
higher
points
and
the
land
fell
steeply
away
again
only
a
short
distance
ahead
frodo
threw
himself
down
and
lay
on
the
ground
shivering
his
left
arm
was
lifeless
and
his
side
and
shoulder
felt
as
if
icy
claws
were
laid
upon
them
the
trees
and
rocks
about
him
seemed
shadowy
and
dim

'we
cannot
go
any
further'
said
merry
to
strider
'i
am
afraid
this
has
been
too
much
for
frodo
I
am
dreadfully
anxious
about
him
what
are
we
to
do
do
you
think
they
will
be
able
to
cure
him
in
rivendell
if
we
ever
get
there'

'we
shall
see'
answered
strider
'there
is
nothing
more
that
I
can
do
in
the
wilderness
and
it
is
chiefly
because
of
his
wound
that
I
am
so
anxious
to
press
on
but
I
agree
that
we
can
go
no
further
tonight'

'what
is
the
matter
with
my
master'
asked
sam
in
a
low
voice
looking
appealingly
at
strider
'his
wound
was
small
and
it
is
already
closed
there's
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
cold
white
mark
on
his
shoulder'

'frodo
has
been
touched
by
the
weapons
of
the
enemy'
said
strider
'and
there
is
some
poison
or
evil
at
work
that
is
beyond
my
skill
to
drive
out
but
do
not
give
up
hope
sam'

night
was
cold
up
on
the
high
ridge
they
lit
a
small
fire
down
under
the
gnarled
roots
of
an
old
pine
that
hung
over
a
shallow
pit
it
looked
as
if
stone
had
once
been
quarried
there
they
sat
huddled
together
the
wind
blew
chill
through
the
pass
and
they
heard
the
treetops
lower
down
moaning
and
sighing
frodo
lay
half
in
a
dream
imagining
that
endless
dark
wings
were
sweeping
by
above
him
and
that
on
the
wings
rode
pursuers
that
sought
him
in
all
the
hollows
of
the
hills

the
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
the
air
was
clean
and
the
light
pale
and
clear
in
a
rainwashed
sky
their
hearts
were
encouraged
but
hey
longed
for
the
sun
to
warm
their
cold
stiff
limbs
as
soon
as
it
was
light
strider
took
merry
with
him
and
went
to
survey
the
country
from
the
height
to
the
east
of
the
pass
the
sun
had
risen
and
was
shining
brightly
when
he
returned
with
more
comforting
news
they
were
now
going
more
or
less
in
the
right
direction
if
they
went
on
down
the
further
side
of
the
ridge
they
would
have
the
mountains
on
their
left
some
way
ahead
strider
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
loudwater
again
and
he
knew
that
though
it
was
hidden
from
view
the
road
to
the
ford
was
not
far
from
the
river
and
lay
on
the
side
nearest
to
them

'we
must
make
for
the
road
again'
he
said
'we
cannot
hope
to
find
a
path
through
these
hills
whatever
danger
may
beset
it
the
road
is
our
only
way
to
the
ford'

as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
they
set
out
again
they
climbed
slowly
down
the
southern
side
of
the
ridge
but
the
way
was
much
easier
than
they
had
expected
for
the
slope
was
far
less
steep
on
this
side
and
before
long
frodo
was
able
to
ride
again
bill
ferny's
poor
old
pony
was
developing
an
unexpected
talent
for
picking
out
a
path
and
for
sparing
its
rider
as
many
jolts
as
possible
the
spirits
of
the
party
rose
again
even
frodo
felt
better
in
the
morning
light
but
every
now
and
again
a
mist
seemed
to
obscure
his
sight
and
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes

pippin
was
a
little
ahead
of
the
others
suddenly
he
turned
round
and
called
to
them
'there
is
a
path
here'
he
cried

when
they
came
up
with
him
they
saw
that
he
had
made
no
mistake

there
were
clearly
the
beginnings
of
a
path
that
climbed
with
many
windings
out
of
the
woods
below
and
faded
away
on
the
hilltop
behind
in
places
it
was
now
faint
and
overgrown
or
choked
with
fallen
stones
and
trees
but
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
have
been
much
used
it
was
a
path
made
by
strong
arms
and
heavy
feet
here
and
there
old
trees
had
been
cut
or
broken
down
and
large
rocks
cloven
or
heaved
aside
to
make
a
way

they
followed
the
track
for
some
while
for
it
offered
much
the
easiest
way
down
but
they
went
cautiously
and
their
anxiety
increased
as
they
came
into
the
dark
woods
and
the
path
grew
plainer
and
broader
suddenly
coming
out
of
a
belt
of
firtrees
it
ran
steeply
down
a
slope
and
turned
sharply
to
the
left
round
the
comer
of
a
rocky
shoulder
of
the
hill
when
they
came
to
the
comer
they
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
path
ran
on
over
a
level
strip
under
the
face
of
a
low
cliff
overhung
with
trees
in
the
stony
wall
there
was
a
door
hanging
crookedly
ajar
upon
one
great
hinge

outside
the
door
they
all
halted
there
was
a
cave
or
rockchamber
behind
but
in
the
gloom
inside
nothing
could
be
seen
strider
sam
and
merry
pushing
with
all
their
strength
managed
to
open
the
door
a
little
wider
and
then
strider
and
merry
went
in
they
did
not
go
far
for
on
the
floor
lay
many
old
bones
and
nothing
else
was
to
be
seen
near
the
entrance
except
some
great
empty
jars
and
broken
pots

'surely
this
is
a
trollhole
if
ever
there
was
one'
said
pippin
'come
out
you
two
and
let
us
get
away
now
we
know
who
made
the
path
and
we
had
better
get
off
it
quick'

'there
is
no
need
I
think'
said
strider
coining
out
'it
is
certainly
a
trollhole
but
it
seems
to
have
been
long
forsaken
I
don't
think
we
need
be
afraid
but
let
us
go
on
down
warily
and
we
shall
see'

the
path
went
on
again
from
the
door
and
turning
to
the
right
again
across
the
level
space
plunged
down
a
thick
wooded
slope
pippin
not
liking
to
show
strider
that
he
was
still
afraid
went
on
ahead
with
merry
sam
and
strider
came
behind
one
on
each
side
of
frodo's
pony
for
the
path
was
now
broad
enough
for
four
or
five
hobbits
to
walk
abreast
but
they
had
not
gone
very
far
before
pippin
came
running
back
followed
by
merry
they
both
looked
terrified

'there

are

trolls'
pippin
panted
'down
in
a
clearing
in
the
woods
not
far
below
we
got
a
sight
of
them
through
the
treetrunks
they
are
very
large'

'we
will
come
and
look
at
them'
said
strider
picking
up
a
stick
frodo
said
nothing
but
sam
looked
scared

the
sun
was
now
high
and
it
shone
down
through
the
halfstripped
branches
of
the
trees
and
lit
the
clearing
with
bright
patches
of
light
they
halted
suddenly
on
the
edge
and
peered
through
the
treetrunks
holding
their
breath
there
stood
the
trolls
three
large
trolls
one
was
stooping
and
the
other
two
stood
staring
at
him

strider
walked
forward
unconcernedly
'get
up
old
stone'
he
said
and
broke
his
stick
upon
the
stooping
troll

nothing
happened
there
was
a
gasp
of
astonishment
from
the
hobbits
and
then
even
frodo
laughed
'well'
he
said
'we
are
forgetting
our
family
history
these
must
be
the
very
three
that
were
caught
by
gandalf
quarrelling
over
the
right
way
to
cook
thirteen
dwarves
and
one
hobbit'

'i
had
no
idea
we
were
anywhere
near
the
place'
said
pippin
he
knew
the
story
well
bilbo
and
frodo
had
told
it
often
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
never
more
than
half
believed
it
even
now
he
looked
at
the
stone
trolls
with
suspicion
wondering
if
some
magic
might
not
suddenly
bring
them
to
life
again


'you
are
forgetting
not
only
your
family
history
but
all
you
ever
knew
about
trolls'
said
strider
'it
is
broad
daylight
with
a
bright
sun
and
yet
you
come
back
trying
to
scare
me
with
a
tale
of
live
trolls
waiting
for
us
in
this
glade
in
any
case
you
might
have
noticed
that
one
of
them
has
an
old
bird's
nest
behind
his
ear
that
would
be
a
most
unusual
ornament
for
a
live
troll'

they
all
laughed
frodo
felt
his
spirits
reviving
the
reminder
of
bilbo's
first
successful
adventure
was
heartening
the
sun
too
was
warm
and
comforting
and
the
mist
before
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
lifting
a
little
they
rested
for
some
time
in
the
glade
and
took
their
midday
meal
right
under
the
shadow
of
the
trolls'
large
legs

'won't
somebody
give
us
a
bit
of
a
song
while
the
sun
is
high'
said
merry
when
they
had
finished
'we
haven't
had
a
song
or
a
tale
for
days'


'not
since
weathertop'
said
frodo
the
others
looked
at
him
'don't
worry
about
me'
he
added
'i
feel
much
better
but
I
don't
think
I
could
sing
perhaps
sam
could
dig
something
out
of
his
memory'

'come
on
sam'
said
merry
'there's
more
stored
in
your
head
than
you
let
on
about'

'i
don't
know
about
that'
said
sam
'but
how
would
this
suit
it
ain't
what
I
call
proper
poetry
if
you
understand
me
just
a
bit
of
nonsense
but
these
old
images
here
brought
it
to
my
mind'
standing
up
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
if
he
was
at
school
he
began
to
sing
to
an
old
tune

troll
sat
alone
on
his
seat
of
stone

and
munched
and
mumbled
a
bare
old
bone

for
many
a
year
he
had
gnawed
it
near

for
meat
was
hard
to
come
by

done
by
gum
by

in
a
case
in
the
hills
he
dwelt
alone

and
meat
was
hard
to
come
by


up
came
tom
with
his
big
boots
on

said
he
to
troll
'pray
what
is
yon

for
it
looks
like
the
shin
o'
my
nuncle
tim

as
should
be
alyin'
in
graveyard

caveyard
paveyard

this
many
a
year
has
tim
been
gone

and
I
thought
he
were
lyin'
in
graveyard'


'my
lad'
said
troll
'this
bone
I
stole

but
what
be
bones
that
lie
in
a
hole

thy
nuncle
was
dead
as
a
lump
o'
lead

afore
I
found
his
shinbone

tinbone
thinbone

he
can
spare
a
share
for
a
poor
old
troll

for
he
don't
need
his
shinbone'


said
tom
'i
don't
see
why
the
likes
o'
thee

without
axin'
leave
should
go
makin'
free

with
the
shank
or
the
shin
o'
my
father's
kin

so
hand
the
old
bone
over

rover
trover

though
dead
he
be
it
belongs
to
he

so
hand
the
old
bone
over'



'for
a
couple
o'
pins'
says
troll
and
grins

'i'll
eat
thee
too
and
gnaw
thy
shins

a
bit
o'
fresh
meal
will
go
down
sweet

i'll
try
my
teeth
on
thee
now

hee
now
see
now

i'm
tired
o'
gnawing
old
bones
and
skins

i've
a
mind
to
dine
on
thee
now'


but
just
as
he
thought
his
dinner
was
caught

he
found
his
hands
had
hold
of
naught

before
he
could
mind
tom
slipped
behind

and
gave
him
the
boot
to
larn
him

warn
him
darn
him

a
bump
o'
the
boot
on
the
seat
tom
thought

would
be
the
way
to
larn
him


but
harder
than
stone
is
the
flesh
and
bone

of
a
troll
that
sits
in
the
hills
alone

as
well
set
your
boot
to
the
mountain's
root

for
the
seat
of
a
troll
don't
feel
it

peel
it
heal
it

old
troll
laughed
when
he
heard
tom
groan

and
he
knew
his
toes
could
feel
it


tom's
leg
is
game
since
home
he
came

and
his
bootless
foot
is
lasting
lame

but
troll
don't
care
and
he's
still
there

with
the
bone
he
boned
from
its
owner

doner
boner

troll's
old
seat
is
still
the
same

and
the
bone
he
boned
from
its
owner


'well
that's
a
warning
to
us
all'
laughed
merry
'it
is
as
well
you
used
a
stick
and
not
your

hand
strider'
'where
did
you
come
by
that
sam'
asked
pippin
'i've
never
heard
those
words
before'
sam
muttered
something
inaudible
'it's
out
of
his
own
head
of
course'
said
frodo
'i
am

learning
a
lot
about
sam
gamgee
on
this
journey
first
he
was
a
conspirator
now
he's
a
jester
he'll
end
up
by
becoming
a
wizard

or
a
warrior'
'i
hope
not'
said
sam
'i
don't
want
to
be
neither'

in
the
afternoon
they
went
on
down
the
woods
they
were
probably
following
the
very
track
that
gandalf
bilbo
and
the
dwarves
had
used
many
years
before
after
a
few
miles
they
came
out
on
the
top
of
a
high
bank
above
the
road
at
this
point
the
road
had
left
the
hoarwell
far
behind
in
its
narrow
valley
and
now
clung
close
to
the
feet
of
the
hills
rolling
and
winding
eastward
among
woods
and
heathercovered
slopes
towards
the
ford
and
the
mountains
not
far
down
the
bank
strider
pointed
out
a
stone
in
the
grass
on
it
roughly
cut
and
now
much
weathered
could
still
be
seen
dwarfrunes
and
secret
marks

'there'
said
merry
'that
must
be
the
stone
that
marked
the
place
where
the
trolls'
gold
was
hidden
how
much
is
left
of
bilbo's
share
I
wonder
frodo'


frodo
looked
at
the
stone
and
wished
that
bilbo
had
brought
home
no
treasure
more
perilous
nor
less
easy
to
pan
with
'none
at
all'
he
said
'bilbo
gave
it
all
away
he
told
me
he
did
not
feel
it
was
really
his
as
it
came
from
robbers'

the
road
lay
quiet
under
the
long
shadows
of
early
evening
there
was
no
sign
of
any
other
travellers
to
be
seen
as
there
was
now
no
other
possible
course
for
them
to
take
they
climbed
down
the
bank
and
turning
left
went
off
as
fast
as
they
could
soon
a
shoulder
of
the
hills
cut
off
the
light
of
the
fast
westering
sun
a
cold
wind
flowed
down
to
meet
them
from
the
mountains
ahead

they
were
beginning
to
look
out
for
a
place
off
the
road
where
they
could
camp
for
the
night
when
they
heard
a
sound
that
brought
sudden
fear
back
into
their
hearts
the
noise
of
hoofs
behind
them
they
looked
back
but
they
could
not
see
far
because
of
the
many
windings
and
rollings
of
the
road
as
quickly
as
they
could
they
scrambled
off
the
beaten
way
and
up
into
the
deep
heather
and
bilberry
brushwood
on
the
slopes
above
until
they
came
to
a
small
patch
of
thickgrowing
hazels
as
they
peered
out
from
among
the
bushes
they
could
see
the
road
faint
and
grey
in
the
failing
light
some
thirty
feel
below
them
the
sound
of
hoofs
drew
nearer
they
were
going
fast
with
a
light

clippetyclippelyclip

then
faintly
as
if
it
was
blown
away
from
them
by
the
breeze
they
seemed
to
catch
a
dim
ringing
as
of
small
bells
tinkling

'that
does
not
sound
like
a
black
rider's
horse'
said
frodo
listening
intently
the
other
hobbits
agreed
hopefully
that
it
did
not
but
they
all
remained
full
of
suspicion
they
had
been
in
fear
of
pursuit
for
so
long
that
any
sound
from
behind
seemed
ominous
and
unfriendly
but
strider
was
now
leaning
forward
stooped
to
the
ground
with
a
hand
to
his
ear
and
a
look
of
joy
on
his
face

the
light
faded
and
the
leaves
on
the
bushes
rustled
softly
clearer
and
nearer
now
the
bells
jingled
and

clippetyclip

came
the
quick
trotting
feet
suddenly
into
view
below
came
a
white
horse
gleaming
in
the
shadows
running
swiftly
in
the
dusk
its
headstall
flickered
and
flashed
as
if
it
were
studded
with
gems
like
living
stars
the
rider's
cloak
streamed
behind
him
and
his
hood
was
thrown
back
his
golden
hair
flowed
shimmering
in
the
wind
of
his
speed
to
frodo
it
appeared
that
a
white
light
was
shining
through
the
form
and
raiment
of
the
rider
as
if
through
a
thin
veil

strider
sprang
from
hiding
and
dashed
down
towards
the
road
leaping
with
a
cry
through
the
heather
but
even
before
he
had
moved
or
called
the
rider
had
reined
in
his
horse
and
halted
looking
up
towards
the
thicket
where
they
stood
when
he
saw
strider
he
dismounted
and
ran
to
meet
him
calling
out

ai
na
vedui
dnadan
mae
govannen

his
speech
and
clear
ringing
voice
left
no
doubt
in
their
hearts
the
rider
was
of
the
elvenfolk
no
others
that
dwelt
in
the
wide
world
had
voices
so
fair
to
hear
but
there
seemed
to
be
a
note
of
haste
or
fear
in
his
call
and
they
saw
that
he
was
now
speaking
quickly
and
urgently
to
strider

soon
strider
beckoned
to
them
and
the
hobbits
left
the
bushes
and
hurried
down
to
the
road
'this
is
glorfindel
who
dwells
in
the
house
of
elrond'
said
strider

'hail
and
well
met
at
last'
said
the
elflord
to
frodo
'i
was
sent
from
rivendell
to
look
for
you
we
feared
that
you
were
in
danger
upon
the
road'

'then
gandalf
has
reached
rivendell'
cried
frodo
joyfully

'no
he
had
not
when
I
departed
but
that
was
nine
days
ago'
answered
glorfindel
'elrond
received
news
that
troubled
him
some
of
my
kindred
journeying
in
your
land
beyond
the
baranduin
learned
that
things
were
amiss
and
sent
messages
as
swiftly
as
they
could
they
said
that
the
nine
were
abroad
and
that
you
were
astray
bearing
a
great
burden
without
guidance
for
gandalf
had
not
returned
there
are
few
even
in
rivendell
that
can
ride
openly
against
the
nine
but
such
as
there
were
elrond
sent
out
north
west
and
south
it
was
thought
that
you
might
turn
far
aside
to
avoid
pursuit
and
become
lost
in
the
wilderness

'it
was
my
lot
to
take
the
road
and
I
came
to
the
bridge
of
mitheithel
and
left
a
token
there
nigh
on
seven
days
ago
three
of
the
servants
of
sauron
were
upon
the
bridge
but
they
withdrew
and
I
pursued
them
westward
I
came
also
upon
two
others
but
they
turned
away
southward
since
then
I
have
searched
for
your
trail
two
days
ago
I
found
it
and
followed
it
over
the
bridge
and
today
I
marked
where
you
descended
from
the
hills
again
but
come
there
is
no
time
for
further
news
since
you
are
here
we
must
risk
the
peril
of
the
road
and
go
there
are
five
behind
us
and
when
they
find
your
trail
upon
the
road
they
will
ride
after
us
like
the
wind
and
they
are
not
all
where
the
other
four
may
be
I
do
not
know
I
fear
that
we
may
find
the
ford
is
already
held
against
us'

while
glorfindel
was
speaking
the
shades
of
evening
deepened
frodo
felt
a
great
weariness
come
over
him
ever
since
the
sun
began
to
sink
the
mist
before
his
eyes
had
darkened
and
he
felt
that
a
shadow
was
coming
between
him
and
the
faces
of
his
friends
now
pain
assailed
him
and
he
felt
cold
he
swayed
clutching
at
sam's
arm

'my
master
is
sick
and
wounded'
said
sam
angrily
'he
can't
go
on
riding
after
nightfall
he
needs
rest'

glorfindel
caught
frodo
as
he
sank
to
the
ground
and
taking
him
gently
in
his
arms
he
looked
in
his
face
with
grave
anxiety

briefly
strider
told
of
the
attack
on
their
camp
under
weathertop
and
of
the
deadly
knife
he
drew
out
the
hilt
which
he
had
kept
and
handed
it
to
the
elf
glorfindel
shuddered
as
he
took
it
but
he
looked
intently
at
it

'there
are
evil
things
written
on
this
hilt'
he
said
'though
maybe
your
eyes
cannot
see
them
keep
it
aragorn
till
we
reach
the
house
of
elrond
but
be
wary
and
handle
it
as
little
as
you
may
alas
the
wounds
of
this
weapon
are
beyond
my
skill
to
heal
I
will
do
what
I
can

but
all
the
more
do
I
urge
you
now
to
go
on
without
rest'

he
searched
the
wound
on
frodo's
shoulder
with
his
fingers
and
his
face
grew
graver
as
if
what
he
learned
disquieted
him
but
frodo
felt
the
chill
lessen
in
his
side
and
arm
a
little
warmth
crept
down
from
his
shoulder
to
his
hand
and
the
pain
grew
easier
the
dusk
of
evening
seemed
to
grow
lighter
about
him
as
if
a
cloud
had
been
withdrawn
he
saw
his
friends'
faces
more
clearly
again
and
a
measure
of
new
hope
and
strength
returned

'you
shall
ride
my
horse'
said
glorfindel
'i
will
shorten
the
stirrups
up
to
the
saddleskins
and
you
must
sit
as
tight
as
you
can
but
you
need
not
fear
my
horse
will
not
let
any
rider
fall
that
I
command
him
to
bear
his
pace
is
light
and
smooth
and
if
danger
presses
too
near
he
will
bear
you
away
with
a
speed
that
even
the
black
steeds
of
the
enemy
cannot
rival'

'no
he
will
not'
said
frodo
'i
shall
not
ride
him
if
I
am
to
be
carried
off
to
rivendell
or
anywhere
else
leaving
my
friends
behind
in
danger'

glorfindel
smiled
'i
doubt
very
much'
he
said
'if
your
friends
would
be
in
danger
if
you
were
not
with
them
the
pursuit
would
follow
you
and
leave
us
in
peace
I
think
it
is
you
frodo
and
that
which
you
bear
that
brings
us
all
in
peril'

to
that
frodo
had
no
answer
and
he
was
persuaded
to
mount
glorfindel's
white
horse
the
pony
was
laden
instead
with
a
great
part
of
the
others'
burdens
so
that
they
now
marched
lighter
and
for
a
time
made
good
speed
but
the
hobbits
began
to
find
it
hard
to
keep
up
with
the
swift
tireless
feet
of
the
elf
on
he
led
them
into
the
mouth
of
darkness
and
still
on
under
the
deep
clouded
night
there
was
neither
star
nor
moon
not
until
the
grey
of
dawn
did
he
allow
them
to
halt
pippin
merry
and
sam
were
by
that
time
nearly
asleep
on
their
stumbling
legs
and
even
strider
seemed
by
the
sag
of
his
shoulders
to
be
weary
frodo
sat
upon
the
horse
in
a
dark
dream

they
cast
themselves
down
in
the
heather
a
few
yards
from
the
roadside
and
fell
asleep
immediately
they
seemed
hardly
to
have
closed
their
eyes
when
glorfindel
who
had
set
himself
to
watch
while
they
slept
awoke
them
again
the
sun
had
now
climbed
far
into
the
morning
and
the
clouds
and
mists
of
the
night
were
gone

'drink
this'
said
glorfindel
to
them
pouring
for
each
in
turn
a
little
liquor
from
his
silverstudded
flask
of
leather
it
was
clear
as
spring
water
and
had
no
taste
and
it
did
not
feel
either
cool
or
warm
in
the
mouth
but
strength
and
vigour
seemed
to
flow
into
all
their
limbs
as
they
drank
it

eaten
after
that
draught
the
stale
bread
and
dried
fruit
which
was
now
all
that
they
had
left
seemed
to
satisfy
their
hunger
better
than
many
a
good
breakfast
in
the
shire
had
done

they
had
rested
rather
less
than
five
hours
when
they
took
to
the
road
again
glorfindel
still
urged
them
on
and
only
allowed
two
brief
halts
during
the
day's
march
in
this
way
they
covered
almost
twenty
miles
before
nightfall
and
came
to
a
point
where
the
road
bent
right
and
ran
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
valley
now
making
straight
for
the
bruinen
so
far
there
had
been
no
sign
or
sound
of
pursuit
that
the
hobbits
could
see
or
hear
but
often
glorfindel
would
halt
and
listen
for
a
moment
if
they
lagged
behind
and
a
look
of
anxiety
clouded
his
face
once
or
twice
he
spoke
to
strider
in
the
elftongue

but
however
anxious
their
guides
might
be
it
was
plain
that
the
hobbits
could
go
no
further
that
night
they
were
stumbling
along
dizzy
with
weariness
and
unable
to
think
of
anything
but
their
feet
and
legs
frodo's
pain
had
redoubled
and
during
the
day
things
about
him
faded
to
shadows
of
ghostly
grey
he
almost
welcomed
the
coming
of
night
for
then
the
world
seemed
less
pale
and
empty

the
hobbits
were
still
weary
when
they
set
out
again
early
next
morning
there
were
many
miles
yet
to
go
between
them
and
the
ford
and
they
hobbled
forward
at
the
best
pace
they
could
manage

'our
peril
will
be
greatest
just
ere
we
reach
the
river'
said
glorfindel
'for
my
heart
warns
me
that
the
pursuit
is
now
swift
behind
us
and
other
danger
may
be
waiting
by
the
ford'

the
road
was
still
running
steadily
downhill
and
there
was
now
in
places
much
grass
at
either
side
in
which
the
hobbits
walked
when
they
could
to
ease
their
tired
feet
in
the
late
afternoon
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
went
suddenly
under
the
dark
shadow
of
tall
pinetrees
and
then
plunged
into
a
deep
cutting
with
steep
moist
walls
of
red
stone
echoes
ran
along
as
they
hurried
forward
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
sound
of
many
footfalls
following
their
own
all
at
once
as
if
through
a
gate
of
light
the
road
ran
out
again
from
the
end
of
the
tunnel
into
the
open
there
at
the
bottom
of
a
sharp
incline
they
saw
before
them
a
long
flat
mile
and
beyond
that
the
ford
of
rivendell
on
the
further
side
was
a
steep
brown
bank
threaded
by
a
winding
path
and
behind
that
the
tall
mountains
climbed
shoulder
above
shoulder
and
peak
beyond
peak
into
the
fading
sky

there
was
still
an
echo
as
of
following
feet
in
the
cutting
behind
them
a
rushing
noise
as
if
a
wind
were
rising
and
pouring
through
the
branches
of
the
pines
one
moment
glorfindel
turned
and
listened
then
he
sprang
forward
with
a
loud
cry

'fly'
he
called
'fly
the
enemy
is
upon
us'

the
white
horse
leaped
forward
the
hobbits
ran
down
the
slope
glorfindel
and
strider
followed
as
rearguard
they
were
only
half
way
across
the
flat
when
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
of
horses
galloping
out
of
the
gate
in
the
trees
that
they
had
just
left
rode
a
black
rider
he
reined
his
horse
in
and
halted
swaying
in
his
saddle
another
followed
him
and
then
another
then
again
two
more

'ride
forward
ride'
cried
glorfindel
to
frodo

he
did
not
obey
at
once
for
a
strange
reluctance
seized
him
checking
the
horse
to
a
walk
he
turned
and
looked
back
the
riders
seemed
to
sit
upon
their
great
steeds
like
threatening
statues
upon
a
hill
dark
and
solid
while
all
the
woods
and
land
about
them
receded
as
if
into
a
mist
suddenly
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
they
were
silently
commanding
him
to
wait
then
at
once
fear
and
hatred
awoke
in
him
his
hand
left
the
bridle
and
gripped
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
with
a
red
flash
he
drew
it

'ride
on
ride
on'
cried
glorfindel
and
then
loud
and
clear
he
called
to
the
horse
in
the
elftongue

noro
lim
noro
lim
asfaloth


at
once
the
white
horse
sprang
away
and
sped
like
the
wind
along
the
last
lap
of
the
road
at
the
same
moment
the
black
horses
leaped
down
the
hill
in
pursuit
and
from
the
riders
came
a
terrible
cry
such
as
frodo
had
heard
filling
the
woods
with
horror
in
the
eastfarthing
far
away
it
was
answered
and
to
the
dismay
of
frodo
and
his
friends
out
from
the
trees
and
rocks
away
on
the
left
four
other
riders
came
flying
two
rode
towards
frodo
two
galloped
madly
towards
the
ford
to
cut
off
his
escape
they
seemed
to
him
to
run
like
the
wind
and
to
grow
swiftly
larger
and
darker
as
their
courses
converged
with
his

frodo
looked
back
for
a
moment
over
his
shoulder
he
could
no
longer
see
his
friends
the
riders
behind
were
falling
back
even
their
great
steeds
were
no
match
in
speed
for
the
white
elfhorse
of
glorfindel
he
looked
forward
again
and
hope
faded
there
seemed
no
chance
of
reaching
the
ford
before
he
was
cut
off
by
the
others
that
had
lain
in
ambush
he
could
see
them
clearly
now
they
appeared
to
have
cast
aside
their
hoods
and
black
cloaks
and
they
were
robed
in
white
and
grey
swords
were
naked
in
their
pale
hands
helms
were
on
their
heads
their
cold
eyes
glittered
and
they
called
to
him
with
fell
voices

fear
now
filled
all
frodo's
mind
he
thought
no
longer
of
his
sword
no
cry
came
from
him
he
shut
his
eyes
and
clung
to
the
horse's
mane
the
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
and
the
bells
upon
the
harness
rang
wild
and
shrill
a
breath
of
deadly
cold
pierced
him
like
a
spear
as
with
a
last
spurt
like
a
flash
of
white
fire
the
elfhorse
speeding
as
if
on
wings
passed
right
before
the
face
of
the
foremost
rider

frodo
heard
the
splash
of
water
it
foamed
about
his
feet
he
felt
the
quick
heave
and
surge
as
the
horse
left
the
river
and
struggled
up
the
stony
path
he
was
climbing
the
steep
bank
he
was
across
the
ford

but
the
pursuers
were
close
behind
at
the
top
of
the
bank
the
horse
halted
and
turned
about
neighing
fiercely
there
were
nine
riders
at
the
water's
edge
below
and
frodo's
spirit
quailed
before
the
threat
of
their
uplifted
faces
he
knew
of
nothing
that
would
prevent
them
from
crossing
as
easily
as
he
had
done
and
he
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
escape
over
the
long
uncertain
path
from
the
ford
to
the
edge
of
rivendell
if
once
the
riders
crossed
in
any
case
he
felt
that
he
was
commanded
urgently
to
halt
hatred
again
stirred
in
him
but
he
had
no
longer
the
strength
to
refuse

suddenly
the
foremost
rider
spurred
his
horse
forward
it
checked
at
the
water
and
reared
up
with
a
great
effort
frodo
sat
upright
and
brandished
his
sword

'go
back'
he
cried
'go
back
to
the
land
of
mordor
and
follow
me
no
more
'
his
voice
sounded
thin
and
shrill
in
his
own
ears
the
riders
halted
but
frodo
had
not
the
power
of
bombadil
his
enemies
laughed
at
him
with
a
harsh
and
chilling
laughter
'come
back
come
back'
they
called
'to
mordor
we
will
take
you'

'go
back'
he
whispered

'the
ring
the
ring'
they
cried
with
deadly
voices
and
immediately
their
leader
urged
his
horse
forward
into
the
water
followed
closely
by
two
others

'by
elbereth
and
lthien
the
fair'
said
frodo
with
a
last
effort
lifting
up
his
sword
'you
shall
have
neither
the
ring
nor
me'

then
the
leader
who
was
now
half
across
the
ford
stood
up
menacing
in
his
stirrups
and
raised
up
his
hand
frodo
was
stricken
dumb
he
felt
his
tongue
cleave
to
his
mouth
and
his
heart
labouring
his
sword
broke
and
fell
out
of
his
shaking
hand
the
elfhorse
reared
and
snorted
the
foremost
of
the
black
horses
had
almost
set
foot
upon
the
shore

at
that
moment
there
came
a
roaring
and
a
rushing
a
noise
of
loud
waters
rolling
many
stones
dimly
frodo
saw
the
river
below
him
rise
and
down
along
its
course
there
came
a
plumed
cavalry
of
waves
white
flames
seemed
to
frodo
to
flicker
on
their
crests
and
he
half
fancied
that
he
saw
amid
the
water
white
riders
upon
white
horses
with
frothing
manes
the
three
riders
that
were
still
in
the
midst
of
the
ford
were
overwhelmed
they
disappeared
buried
suddenly
under
angry
foam
those
that
were
behind
drew
back
in
dismay

with
his
last
failing
senses
frodo
heard
cries
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
beyond
the
riders
that
hesitated
on
the
shore
a
shining
figure
of
white
light
and
behind
it
ran
small
shadowy
forms
waving
flames
that
flared
red
in
the
grey
mist
that
was
falling
over
the
world


the
black
horses
were
filled
with
madness
and
leaping
forward
in
terror
they
bore
their
riders
into
the
rushing
flood
their
piercing
cries
were
drowned
in
the
roaring
of
the
river
as
it
carried
them
away
then
frodo
felt
himself
falling
and
the
roaring
and
confusion
seemed
to
rise
and
engulf
him
together
with
his
enemies
he
heard
and
saw
no
more


chapter

many
meetings


frodo
woke
and
found
himself
lying
in
bed
at
first
he
thought
that
he
had
slept
late
after
a
long
unpleasant
dream
that
still
hovered
on
the
edge
of
memory
or
perhaps
he
had
been
ill
but
the
ceiling
looked
strange
it
was
flat
and
it
had
dark
beams
richly
carved
he
lay
a
little
while
longer
looking
at
patches
of
sunlight
on
the
wall
and
listening
to
the
sound
of
a
waterfall

where
am
I
and
what
is
the
time'
he
said
aloud
to
the
ceiling
'in
the
house
of
elrond
and
it
is
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning'
said
a
voice
it
is
the
morning
of
october
the
twentyfourth
if
you
want
to
know'

gandalf'
cried
frodo
sitting
up
there
was
the
old
wizard
sitting
in
a
chair
by
the
open
window

yes'
he
said
I
am
here
and
you
are
lucky
to
be
here
too
after
all
the
absurd
things
you
have
done
since
you
left
home'
frodo
lay
down
again
he
felt
too
comfortable
and
peaceful
to
argue
and
in
any
case
he
did
not
think
he
would
get
the
better
of
an
argument
he
was
fully
awake
now
and
the
memory
of
his
journey
was
returning
the
disastrous
short
cut'
through
the
old
forest
the
accident'
at

the
prancing
pony

and
his
madness
in
putting
on
the
ring
in
the
dell
under
weathertop
while
he
was
thinking
of
all
these
things
and
trying
in
vain
to
bring
his
memory
down
to
his
arriving
in
rivendell
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
the
soft
puffs
of
gandalf's
pipe
as
he
blew
white
smokerings
out
of
the
window

'where's
sam'
frodo
asked
at
length
'and
are
the
others
all
right'

'yes
they
are
all
safe
and
sound'
answered
gandalf
sam
was
here
until
I
sent
him
off
to
get
some
rest
about
half
an
hour
ago'

what
happened
at
the
ford'
said
frodo
it
all
seemed
so
dim
somehow
and
it
still
does'

'yes
it
would
you
were
beginning
to
fade'
answered
gandalf
'the
wound
was
overcoming
you
at
last
a
few
more
hours
and
you
would
have
been
beyond
our
aid
but
you
have
some
strength
in
you
my
dear
hobbit
as
you
showed
in
the
barrow
that
was
touch
and
go
perhaps
the
most
dangerous
moment
of
all
I
wish
you
could
have
held
out
at
weathertop'

'you
seem
to
know
a
great
deal
already'
said
frodo
I
have
not
spoken
to
the
others
about
the
barrow
at
first
it
was
too
horrible
and
afterwards
there
were
other
things
to
think
about
how
do
you
know
about
it'

'you
have
talked
long
in
your
sleep
frodo'
said
gandalf
gently
'and
it
has
not
been
hard
for
me
to
read
your
mind
and
memory
do
not
worry
though
I
said
absurd
just
now
I
did
not
mean
it
I
think
well
of
youand
of
the
others
it
is
no
small
feat
to
have
come
so
far
and
through
such
dangers
still
bearing
the
ring'

'we
should
never
have
done
it
without
strider'
said
frodo
but
we
needed
you
I
did
not
know
what
to
do
without
you'

'i
was
delayed'
said
gandalf
and
that
nearly
proved
our
ruin
and
yet
I
am
not
sure
it
may
have
been
better
so'

'i
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
happened'

'all
in
good
time
you
are
not
supposed
to
talk
or
worry
about
anything
today
by
elrond's
orders'


but
talking
would
stop
me
thinking
and
wondering
which
are
quite
as
tiring'
said
frodo
'i
am
wide
awake
now
and
I
remember
so
many
things
that
want
explaining
why
were
you
delayed
you
ought
to
tell
me
that
at
least'

'you
will
soon
hear
all
you
wish
to
know'
said
gandalf
'we
shall
have
a
council
as
soon
as
you
are
well
enough
at
the
moment
I
will
only
say
that
I
was
held
captive'

'you'
cried
frodo

'yes
I
gandalf
the
grey'
said
the
wizard
solemnly
'there
are
many
powers
in
the
world
for
good
or
for
evil
some
are
greater
than
I
am
against
some
I
have
not
yet
been
measured
but
my
time
is
coming
the
morgullord
and
his
black
riders
have
come
forth
war
is
preparing'

then
you
knew
of
the
riders
alreadybefore
I
met
them'

'yes
I
knew
of
them
indeed
I
spoke
of
them
once
to
you
for
the
black
riders
are
the
ringwraiths
the
nine
servants
of
the
lord
of
the
rings
but
I
did
not
know
that
they
had
arisen
again
or
I
should
have
fled
with
you
at
once
I
heard
news
of
them
only
after
I
left
you
in
june
but
that
story
must
wait
for
the
moment
we
have
been
saved
from
disaster
by
aragorn'

'yes'
said
frodo
it
was
strider
that
saved
us
yet
I
was
afraid
of
him
at
first
sam
never
quite
trusted
him
I
think
not
at
any
rate
until
we
met
glorfindel'

gandalf
smiled
I
have
heard
all
about
sam'
he
said
'he
has
no
more
doubts
now'

'i
am
glad'
said
frodo
'for
I
have
become
very
fond
of
strider
well

fond

is
not
the
right
word
I
mean
he
is
dear
to
me
though
he
is
strange
and
grim
at
times
in
fact
he
reminds
me
often
of
you
I
didn't
know
that
any
of
the
big
people
were
like
that
I
thought
well
that
they
were
just
big
and
rather
stupid
kind
and
stupid
like
butterbur
or
stupid
and
wicked
like
bill
ferny
but
then
we
don't
know
much
about
men
in
the
shire
except
perhaps
the
breelanders'

you
don't
know
much
even
about
them
if
you
think
old
barliman
is
stupid'
said
gandalf
'he
is
wise
enough
on
his
own
ground
he
thinks
less
than
he
talks
and
slower
yet
he
can
see
through
a
brick
wall
in
time
as
they
say
in
bree
but
there
are
few
left
in
middleearth
like
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
the
race
of
the
kings
from
over
the
sea
is
nearly
at
an
end
it
may
be
that
this
war
of
the
ring
will
be
their
last
adventure'

'do
you
really
mean
that
strider
is
one
of
the
people
of
the
old
kings'
said
frodo
in
wonder
I
thought
they
had
all
vanished
long
ago
I
thought
he
was
only
a
ranger'

'only
a
ranger'
cried
gandalf
my
dear
frodo
that
is
just
what
the
rangers
are
the
last
remnant
in
the
north
of
the
great
people
the
men
of
the
west
they
have
helped
me
before
and
I
shall
need
their
help
in
the
days
to
come
for
we
have
reached
rivendell
but
the
ring
is
not
yet
at
rest'

'i
suppose
not'
said
frodo
'but
so
far
my
only
thought
has
been
to
get
here
and
I
hope
I
shan't
have
to
go
any
further
it
is
very
pleasant
just
to
rest
I
have
had
a
month
of
exile
and
adventure
and
I
find
that
has
been
as
much
as
I
want'

he
fell
silent
and
shut
his
eyes
after
a
while
he
spoke
again
'i
have
been
reckoning'
he
said
and
I
can't
bring
the
total
up
to
october
the
twentyfourth
it
ought
to
be
the
twentyfirst
we
must
have
reached
the
ford
by
the
twentieth'

'you
have
talked
and
reckoned
more
than
is
good
for
you'
said
gandalf
how
do
the
side
and
shoulder
feel
now'

'i
don't
know'
frodo
answered
'they
don't
feel
at
all
which
is
an
improvement
but'he
made
an
effort'i
can
move
my
arm
again
a
little
yes
it
is
coming
back
to
life
it
is
not
cold'
he
added
touching
his
left
hand
with
his
right

good'
said
gandalf
it
is
mending
fast
you
will
soon
be
sound
again
elrond
has
cured
you
he
has
tended
you
for
days
ever
since
you
were
brought
in'

'days'
said
frodo

well
four
nights
and
three
days
to
be
exact
the
elves
brought
you
from
this
where
you
lost
count
we
have
been
terribly
anxious
and
sam
has
hardly
left
your
side
day
or
night
except
to
run
messages
elrond
is
a
master
of
healing
but
the
weapons
of
our
enemy
are
deadly
to
tell
you
the
truth
I
had
very
little
hope
for
I
suspected
that
there
was
some
fragment
of
the
blade
still
in
the
closed
wound
but
it
could
not
be
found
until
last
night
then
elrond
removed
a
splinter
it
was
deeply
buried
and
it
was
working
inwards'

frodo
shuddered
remembering
the
cruel
knife
with
notched
blade
that
had
vanished
in
strider's
hands
don't
be
alarmed'
said
gandalf
it
is
gone
now
it
has
been
melted
and
it
seems
that
hobbits
fade
very
reluctantly
I
have
known
strong
warriors
of
the
big
people
who
would
quickly
have
been
overcome
by
that
splinter
which
you
bore
for
seventeen
days'

what
would
they
have
done
to
me'
asked
frodo
what
were
the
riders
trying
to
do'

'they
tried
to
pierce
your
heart
with
a
morgulknife
which
remains
in
the
wound
if
they
had
succeeded
you
would
have
become
like
they
are
only
weaker
and
under
their
command
you
would
have
became
a
wraith
under
the
dominion
of
the
dark
lord
and
he
would
have
tormented
you
for
trying
to
keep
his
ring
if
any
greater
torment
were
possible
than
being
robbed
of
it
and
seeing
it
on
his
hand'

'thank
goodness
I
did
not
realize
the
horrible
danger'
said
frodo
faintly
I
was
mortally
afraid
of
course
but
if
I
had
known
more
I
should
not
have
dared
even
to
move
it
is
a
marvel
that
I
escaped'

'yes
fortune
or
fate
have
helped
you'
said
gandalf
not
to
mention
courage
for
your
heart
was
not
touched
and
only
your
shoulder
was
pierced
and
that
was
because
you
resisted
to
the
last
but
it
was
a
terribly
narrow
shave
so
to
speak
you
were
in
gravest
peril
while
you
wore
the
ring
for
then
you
were
half
in
the
wraithworld
yourself
and
they
might
have
seized
you
you
could
see
them
and
they
could
see
you'

I
know'
said
frodo
they
were
terrible
to
behold
but
why
could
we
all
see
their
horses'

because
they
are
real
horses
just
as
the
black
robes
are
real
robes
that
they
wear
to
give
shape
to
their
nothingness
when
they
have
dealings
with
the
living'

then
why
do
these
black
horses
endure
such
riders
all
other
animals
are
terrified
when
they
draw
near
even
the
elfhorse
of
glorfindel
the
dogs
howl
and
the
geese
scream
at
them'

because
these
horses
are
born
and
bred
to
the
service
of
the
dark
lord
in
mordor
not
all
his
servants
and
chattels
are
wraiths
there
are
orcs
and
trolls
there
are
wargs
and
werewolves
and
there
have
been
and
still
are
many
men
warriors
and
kings
that
walk
alive
under
the
sun
and
yet
are
under
his
sway
and
their
number
is
growing
daily'

what
about
rivendell
and
the
elves
is
rivendell
safe'

yes
at
present
until
all
else
is
conquered
the
elves
may
fear
the
dark
lord
and
they
may
fly
before
him
but
never
again
will
they
listen
to
him
or
serve
him
and
here
in
rivendell
there
live
still
some
of
his
chief
foes
the
elvenwise
lords
of
the
eldar
from
beyond
the
furthest
seas
they
do
not
fear
the
ringwraiths
for
those
who
have
dwelt
in
the
blessed
realm
live
at
once
in
both
worlds
and
against
both
the
seen
and
the
unseen
they
have
great
power'

'i
thought
that
I
saw
a
white
figure
that
shone
and
did
not
grow
dim
like
the
others
was
that
glorfindel
then'

'yes
you
saw
him
for
a
moment
as
he
is
upon
the
other
side
one
of
the
mighty
of
the
firstborn
he
is
an
elflord
of
a
house
of
princes
indeed
there
is
a
power
in
rivendell
to
withstand
the
might
of
mordor
for
a
while
and
elsewhere
other
powers
still
dwell
there
is
power
too
of
another
kind
in
the
shire
but
all
such
places
will
soon
become
islands
under
siege
if
things
go
on
as
they
are
going
the
dark
lord
is
putting
forth
all
his
strength

still'
he
said
standing
suddenly
up
and
sticking
out
his
chin
while
his
beard
went
stiff
and
straight
like
bristling
wire
we
must
keep
up
our
courage
you
will
soon
be
well
if
I
do
not
talk
you
to
death
you
are
in
rivendell
and
you
need
not
worry
about
anything
for
the
present'

'i
haven't
any
courage
to
keep
up'
said
frodo
but
I
am
not
worried
at
the
moment
just
give
me
news
of
my
friends
and
tell
me
the
end
of
the
affair
at
the
ford
as
I
keep
on
asking
and
I
shall
be
content
for
the
present
after
that
I
shall
have
another
sleep
I
think
but
I
shan't
be
able
to
close
my
eyes
until
you
have
finished
the
story
for
me'


gandalf
moved
his
chair
to
the
bedside
and
took
a
good
look
at
frodo
the
colour
had
come
back
to
his
face
and
his
eyes
were
clear
and
fully
awake
and
aware
he
was
smiling
and
there
seemed
to
be
little
wrong
with
him
but
to
the
wizard's
eye
there
was
a
faint
change
just
a
hint
as
it
were
of
transparency
about
him
and
especially
about
the
left
hand
that
lay
outside
upon
the
coverlet

still
that
must
be
expected'
said
gandalf
to
himself
he
is
not
half
through
yet
and
to
what
he
will
come
in
the
end
not
even
elrond
can
foretell
not
to
evil
I
think
he
may
become
like
a
glass
filled
with
a
clear
light
for
eyes
to
see
that
can'

you
look
splendid'
he
said
aloud
I
will
risk
a
brief
tale
without
consulting
elrond
but
quite
brief
mind
you
and
then
you
must
sleep
again
this
is
what
happened
as
far
as
I
can
gather
the
riders
made
straight
for
you
as
soon
as
you
fled
they
did
not
need
the
guidance
of
their
horses
any
longer
you
had
become
visible
to
them
being
already
on
the
threshold
of
their
world
and
also
the
ring
drew
them
your
friends
sprang
aside
off
the
road
or
they
would
have
been
ridden
down
they
knew
that
nothing
could
save
you
if
the
white
horse
could
not
the
riders
were
too
swift
to
overtake
and
too
many
to
oppose
on
foot
even
glorfindel
and
aragorn
together
could
not
with
stand
all
the
nine
at
once

when
the
ringwraiths
swept
by
your
friends
ran
up
behind
close
to
the
ford
there
is
a
small
hollow
beside
the
road
masked
by
a
few
stunted
trees
there
they
hastily
kindled
fire
for
glorfindel
knew
that
a
flood
would
come
down
if
the
riders
tried
to
cross
and
then
he
would
have
to
deal
with
any
that
were
left
on
his
side
of
the
river
the
moment
the
flood
appeared
he
rushed
out
followed
by
aragorn
and
the
others
with
flaming
brands
caught
between
fire
and
water
and
seeing
an
elflord
revealed
in
his
wrath
they
were
dismayed
and
their
horses
were
stricken
with
madness
three
were
carried
away
by
the
first
assault
of
the
flood
the
others
were
now
hurled
into
the
water
by
their
horses
and
overwhelmed'

'and
is
that
the
end
of
the
black
riders'
asked
frodo

'no'
said
gandalf
'their
horses
must
have
perished
and
without
them
they
are
crippled
but
the
ringwraiths
themselves
cannot
be
so
easily
destroyed
however
there
is
nothing
more
to
fear
from
them
at
present
your
friends
crossed
after
the
flood
had
passed
and
they
found
you
lying
on
your
face
at
the
top
of
the
bank
with
a
broken
sword
under
you
the
horse
was
standing
guard
beside
you
you
were
pale
and
cold
and
they
feared
that
you
were
dead
or
worse
elrond's
folk
met
them
carrying
you
slowly
towards
rivendell'

who
made
the
flood'
asked
frodo

'elrond
commanded
it'
answered
gandalf
the
river
of
this
valley
is
under
his
power
and
it
will
rise
in
anger
when
he
has
great
need
to
bar
the
ford
as
soon
as
the
captain
of
the
ringwraiths
rode
into
the
water
the
flood
was
released
if
I
may
say
so
I
added
a
few
touches
of
my
own
you
may
not
have
noticed
but
some
of
the
waves
took
the
form
of
great
white
horses
with
shining
white
riders
and
there
were
many
rolling
and
grinding
boulders
for
a
moment
I
was
afraid
that
we
had
let
loose
too
fierce
a
wrath
and
the
flood
would
get
out
of
hand
and
wash
you
all
away
there
is
great
vigour
in
the
waters
that
come
down
from
the
snows
of
the
misty
mountains'

yes
it
all
comes
back
to
me
now'
said
frodo
'the
tremendous
roaring
I
thought
I
was
drowning
with
my
friends
and
enemies
and
all
but
now
we
are
safe'

gandalf
looked
quickly
at
frodo
but
he
had
shut
his
eyes
'yes
you
are
all
safe
for
the
present
soon
there
will
be
feasting
and
merrymaking
to
celebrate
the
victory
at
the
ford
of
bruinen
and
you
will
all
be
there
in
places
of
honour'

'splendid'
said
frodo
it
is
wonderful
that
elrond
and
glorfindel
and
such
great
lords
not
to
mention
strider
should
take
so
much
trouble
and
show
me
so
much
kindness'

well
there
are
many
reasons
why
they
should'
said
gandalf
smiling
I
am
one
good
reason
the
ring
is
another
you
are
the
ringbearer
and
you
are
the
heir
of
bilbo
the
ringfinder'


dear
bilbo'
said
frodo
sleepily
I
wonder
where
he
is
I
wish
he
was
here
and
could
hear
all
about
it
it
would
have
made
him
laugh
the
cow
jumped
over
the
moon
and
the
poor
old
troll'
with
that
he
fell
fast
asleep

frodo
was
now
safe
in
the
last
homely
house
east
of
the
sea
that
house
was
as
bilbo
had
long
ago
reported
a
perfect
house
whether
you
like
food
or
sleep
or
storytelling
or
singing
or
just
sitting
and
thinking
best
or
a
pleasant
mixture
of
them
all'
merely
to
be
there
was
a
cure
for
weariness
fear
and
sadness

as
the
evening
drew
on
frodo
woke
up
again
and
he
found
that
he
no
longer
felt
in
need
of
rest
or
sleep
but
had
a
mind
for
food
and
drink
and
probably
for
singing
and
storytelling
afterwards
he
got
out
of
bed
and
discovered
that
his
arm
was
already
nearly
as
useful
again
as
it
ever
had
been
he
found
laid
ready
clean
garments
of
green
cloth
that
fitted
him
excellently
looking
in
a
mirror
he
was
startled
to
see
a
much
thinner
reflection
of
himself
than
he
remembered
it
looked
remarkably
like
the
young
nephew
of
bilbo
who
used
to
go
tramping
with
his
uncle
in
the
shire
but
the
eyes
looked
out
at
him
thoughtfully

yes
you
have
seen
a
thing
or
two
since
you
last
peeped
out
of
a
lookingglass'
he
said
to
his
reflection
'but
now
for
a
merry
meeting'

he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
whistled
a
tune

at
that
moment
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
sam
came
in
he
ran
to
frodo
and
took
his
left
hand
awkwardly
and
shyly
he
stroked
it
gently
and
then
he
blushed
and
turned
hastily
away

hullo
sam'
said
frodo

it's
warm'
said
sam
meaning
your
hand
mr
frodo
it
has
felt
so
cold
through
the
long
nights
but
glory
and
trumpets'
he
cried
turning
round
again
with
shining
eyes
and
dancing
on
the
floor
'it's
fine
to
see
you
up
and
yourself
again
sir
gandalf
asked
me
to
come
and
see
if
you
were
ready
to
come
down
and
I
thought
he
was
joking'

'i
am
ready'
said
frodo
'let's
go
and
look
for
the
rest
of
the
party'

I
can
take
you
to
them
sir'
said
sam
it's
a
big
house
this
and
very
peculiar
always
a
bit
more
to
discover
and
no
knowing
what
you'll
find
round
a
corner
and
elves
sir
elves
here
and
elves
there
some
like
kings
terrible
and
splendid
and
some
as
merry
as
children
and
the
music
and
the
singingnot
that
I
have
had
the
time
or
the
heart
for
much
listening
since
we
got
here
but
i'm
getting
to
know
some
of
the
ways
of
the
place'

'i
know
what
you
have
been
doing
sam'
said
frodo
taking
his
arm
'but
you
shall
be
merry
tonight
and
listen
to
your
heart's
content
come
on
guide
me
round
the
corners'

sam
led
him
along
several
passages
and
down
many
steps
and
out
into
a
high
garden
above
the
steep
bank
of
the
river
he
found
his
friends
sitting
in
a
porch
on
the
side
of
the
house
looking
east
shadows
had
fallen
in
the
valley
below
but
there
was
still
a
light
on
the
faces
of
the
mountains
far
above
the
air
was
warm
the
sound
of
running
and
falling
water
was
loud
and
the
evening
was
filled
with
a
faint
scent
of
trees
and
flowers
as
if
summer
still
lingered
in
elrond's
gardens

hurray'
cried
pippin
springing
up
here
is
our
noble
cousin
make
way
for
frodo
lord
of
the
ring'

'hush'
said
gandalf
from
the
shadows
at
the
back
of
the
porch
evil
things
do
not
come
into
this
valley
but
all
the
same
we
should
not
name
them
the
lord
of
the
ring
is
not
frodo
but
the
master
of
the
dark
tower
of
mordor
whose
power
is
again
stretching
out
over
the
world
we
are
sitting
in
a
fortress
outside
it
is
getting
dark'

gandalf
has
been
saying
many
cheerful
things
like
that'
said
pippin
he
thinks
I
need
keeping
in
order
but
it
seems
impossible
somehow
to
feel
gloomy
or
depressed
in
this
place
I
feel
I
could
sing
if
I
knew
the
right
song
for
the
occasion'

I
feel
like
singing
myself'
laughed
frodo
though
at
the
moment
I
feel
more
like
eating
and
drinking'


that
will
soon
be
cured'
said
pippin
you
have
shown
your
usual
cunning
in
getting
up
just
in
time
for
a
meal'

more
than
meal
a
feast'
said
merry
as
soon
as
gandalf
reported
that
you
were
recovered
the
preparations
began'
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
they
were
summoned
to
the
hall
by
the
ringing
of
many
bells

the
hall
of
elrond's
house
was
filled
with
folk
elves
for
the
most
part
though
there
were
a
few
guests
of
other
sorts
elrond
as
was
his
custom
sat
in
a
great
chair
at
the
end
of
the
long
table
upon
the
dais
and
next
to
him
on
the
one
side
sat
glorfindel
on
the
other
side
sat
gandalf

frodo
looked
at
them
in
wonder
for
he
had
never
before
seen
elrond
of
whom
so
many
tales
spoke
and
as
they
sat
upon
his
right
hand
and
his
left
glorfindel
and
even
gandalf
whom
he
thought
he
knew
so
well
were
revealed
as
lords
of
dignity
and
power
gandalf
was
shorter
in
stature
than
the
other
two
but
his
long
white
hair
his
sweeping
silver
beard
and
his
broad
shoulders
made
him
look
like
some
wise
king
of
ancient
legend
in
his
aged
face
under
great
snowy
brows
his
dark
eyes
were
set
like
coals
that
could
leap
suddenly
into
fire

glorfindel
was
tall
and
straight
his
hair
was
of
shining
gold
his
face
fair
and
young
and
fearless
and
full
of
joy
his
eyes
were
bright
and
keen
and
his
voice
like
music
on
his
brow
sat
wisdom
and
in
his
hand
was
strength

the
face
of
elrond
was
ageless
neither
old
nor
young
though
in
it
was
written
the
memory
of
many
things
both
glad
and
sorrowful
his
hair
was
dark
as
the
shadows
of
twilight
and
upon
it
was
set
a
circlet
of
silver
his
eyes
were
grey
as
a
clear
evening
and
in
them
was
a
light
like
the
light
of
stars
venerable
he
seemed
as
a
king
crowned
with
many
winters
and
yet
hale
as
a
tried
warrior
in
the
fulness
of
his
strength
he
was
the
lord
of
rivendell
and
mighty
among
both
elves
and
men

in
the
middle
of
the
table
against
the
woven
cloths
upon
the
wall
there
was
a
chair
under
a
canopy
and
there
sat
a
lady
fair
to
look
upon
and
so
like
was
she
in
form
of
womanhood
to
elrond
that
frodo
guessed
that
she
was
one
of
his
close
kindred
young
she
was
and
yet
not
so
the
braids
of
her
dark
hair
were
touched
by
no
frost
her
white
arms
and
clear
face
were
flawless
and
smooth
and
the
light
of
stars
was
in
her
bright
eyes
grey
as
a
cloudless
night
yet
queenly
she
looked
and
thought
and
knowledge
were
in
her
glance
as
of
one
who
has
known
many
things
that
the
years
bring
above
her
brow
her
head
was
covered
with
a
cap
of
silver
lace
netted
with
small
gems
glittering
white
but
her
soft
grey
raiment
had
no
ornament
save
a
girdle
of
leaves
wrought
in
silver

so
it
was
that
frodo
saw
her
whom
few
mortals
had
yet
seen
arwen
daughter
of
elrond
in
whom
it
was
said
that
the
likeness
of
lthien
had
come
on
earth
again
and
she
was
called
undmiel
for
she
was
the
evenstar
of
her
people
long
she
had
been
in
the
land
of
her
mother's
kin
in
lrien
beyond
the
mountains
and
was
but
lately
returned
to
rivendell
to
her
father's
house
but
her
brothers
elladan
and
elrohir
were
out
upon
errantry
for
they
rode
often
far
afield
with
the
rangers
of
the
north
forgetting
never
their
mother's
torment
in
the
dens
of
the
orcs

such
loveliness
in
living
thing
frodo
had
never
seen
before
nor
imagined
in
his
mind
and
he
was
both
surprised
and
abashed
to
find
that
he
had
a
seat
at
elrond's
table
among
all
these
folk
so
high
and
fair
though
he
had
a
suitable
chair
and
was
raised
upon
several
cushions
he
felt
very
small
and
rather
out
of
place
but
that
feeling
quickly
passed
the
feast
was
merry
and
the
food
all
that
his
hunger
could
desire
it
was
some
time
before
he
looked
about
him
again
or
even
turned
to
his
neighbours

he
looked
first
for
his
friends
sam
had
begged
to
be
allowed
to
wait
on
his
master
but
had
been
told
that
for
this
time
he
was
a
guest
of
honour
frodo
could
see
him
now
sitting
with
pippin
and
merry
at
the
upper
end
of
one
of
the
sidetables
close
to
the
dais
he
could
see
no
sign
of
strider

next
to
frodo
on
his
right
sat
a
dwarf
of
important
appearance
richly
dressed
his
beard
very
long
and
forked
was
white
nearly
as
white
as
the
snowwhite
cloth
of
his
garments
he
wore
a
silver
belt
and
round
his
neck
hung
a
chain
of
silver
and
diamonds
frodo
stopped
eating
to
look
at
him

'welcome
and
well
met'
said
the
dwarf
turning
towards
him
then
he
actually
rose
from
his
seat
and
bowed
glin
at
your
service'
he
said
and
bowed
still
lower

'frodo
baggins
at
your
service
and
your
family's'
said
frodo
correctly
rising
in
surprise
and
scattering
his
cushions
'am
I
right
in
guessing
that
you
are

the

glin
one
of
the
twelve
companions
of
the
great
thorin
oakenshield'

quite
right'
answered
the
dwarf
gathering
up
the
cushions
and
courteously
assisting
frodo
back
into
his
seat
'and
I
do
not
ask
for
I
have
already
been
told
that
you
are
the
kinsman
and
adopted
heir
of
our
friend
bilbo
the
renowned
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
on
your
recovery'

thank
you
very
much'
said
frodo

'you
have
had
some
very
strange
adventures
I
hear'
said
glin
'i
wonder
greatly
what
brings

four

hobbits
on
so
long
a
journey
nothing
like
it
has
happened
since
bilbo
came
with
us
but
perhaps
I
should
not
inquire
too
closely
since
elrond
and
gandalf
do
not
seem
disposed
to
talk
of
this'

'i
think
we
will
not
speak
of
it
at
least
not
yet'
said
frodo
politely

he
guessed
that
even
in
elrond's
house
the
matter
of
the
ring
was
not
one
for
casual
talk
and
in
any
case
he
wished
to
forget
his
troubles
for
a
time
'but
I
am
equally
curious'
he
added
to
learn
what
brings
so
important
a
dwarf
so
far
from
the
lonely
mountain'

glin
looked
at
him
'if
you
have
not
heard
I
think
we
will
not
speak
yet
of
that
either
master
elrond
will
summon
us
all
ere
long
I
believe
and
then
we
shall
all
hear
many
things
but
there
is
much
else
that
may
be
told'

throughout
the
rest
of
the
meal
they
talked
together
but
frodo
listened
more
than
he
spoke
for
the
news
of
the
shire
apart
from
the
ring
seemed
small
and
faraway
and
unimportant
while
glin
had
much
to
tell
of
events
in
the
northern
regions
of
wilderland
frodo
learned
that
grimbeorn
the
old
son
of
beorn
was
now
the
lord
of
many
sturdy
men
and
to
their
land
between
the
mountains
and
mirkwood
neither
orc
nor
wolf
dared
to
go

'lndeed'
said
glin
if
it
were
not
for
the
beornings
the
passage
from
dale
to
rivendell
would
long
ago
have
become
impossible
they
are
valiant
men
and
keep
open
the
high
pass
and
the
ford
of
carrock
but
their
tolls
are
high'
he
added
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
like
beorn
of
old
they
are
not
over
fond
of
dwarves
still
they
are
trusty
and
that
is
much
in
these
days
nowhere
are
there
any
men
so
friendly
to
us
as
the
men
of
dale
they
are
good
folk
the
bardings
the
grandson
of
bard
the
bowman
rules
them
brand
son
of
bain
son
of
bard
he
is
a
strong
king
and
his
realm
now
reaches
far
south
and
east
of
esgaroth'

'and
what
of
your
own
people'
asked
frodo

there
is
much
to
tell
good
and
bad'
said
glin
'yet
it
is
mostly
good
we
have
so
far
been
fortunate
though
we
do
not
escape
the
shadow
of
these
times
if
you
really
wish
to
hear
of
us
I
will
tell
you
tidings
gladly
but
stop
me
when
you
are
weary
dwarves'
tongues
run
on
when
speaking
of
their
handiwork
they
say'

and
with
that
glin
embarked
on
a
long
account
of
the
doings
of
the
dwarfkingdom
he
was
delighted
to
have
found
so
polite
a
listener
for
frodo
showed
no
sign
of
weariness
and
made
no
attempt
to
change
the
subject
though
actually
he
soon
got
rather
lost
among
the
strange
names
of
people
and
places
that
he
had
never
heard
of
before
he
was
interested
however
to
hear
that
din
was
still
king
under
the
mountain
and
was
now
old
having
passed
his
two
hundred
and
fiftieth
year
venerable
and
fabulously
rich
of
the
ten
companions
who
had
survived
the
battle
of
five
armies
seven
were
still
with
him
dwalin
glin
dori
nori
bifur
bofur
and
bombur
bombur
was
now
so
fat
that
he
could
not
move
himself
from
his
couch
to
his
chair
at
table
and
it
took
six
young
dwarves
to
lift
him

'and
what
has
become
of
balin
and
ori
and
in'
asked
frodo


a
shadow
passed
over
glin's
face
we
do
not
know'
he
answered
'it
is
largely
on
account
of
balin
that
I
have
come
to
ask
the
advice
of
those
that
dwell
in
rivendell
but
tonight
let
us
speak
of
merrier
things'

glin
began
then
to
talk
of
the
works
of
his
people
telling
frodo
about
their
great
labours
in
dale
and
under
the
mountain
'we
have
done
well'
he
said
but
in
metalwork
we
cannot
rival
our
fathers
many
of
whose
secrets
are
lost
we
make
good
armour
and
keen
swords
but
we
cannot
again
make
mail
or
blade
to
match
those
that
were
made
before
the
dragon
came
only
in
mining
and
building
have
we
surpassed
the
old
days
you
should
see
the
waterways
of
dale
frodo
and
the
fountains
and
the
pools
you
should
see
the
stonepaved
roads
of
many
colours
and
the
halls
and
cavernous
streets
under
the
earth
with
arches
carved
like
trees
and
the
terraces
and
towers
upon
the
mountain's
sides
then
you
would
see
that
we
have
not
been
idle'

'i
will
come
and
see
them
if
ever
I
can'
said
frodo
'how
surprised
bilbo
would
have
been
to
see
all
the
changes
in
the
desolation
of
smaug'

glin
looked
at
frodo
and
smiled
'you
were
very
fond
of
bilbo
were
you
not'
he
asked

yes'
answered
frodo
'i
would
rather
see
him
than
all
the
towers
and
palaces
in
the
world'

at
length
the
feast
came
to
an
end
elrond
and
arwen
rose
and
went
down
the
hall
and
the
company
followed
them
in
due
order
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
they
went
across
a
wide
passage
and
through
other
doors
and
came
into
a
further
hall
in
it
were
no
tables
but
a
bright
fire
was
burning
in
a
great
hearth
between
the
carven
pillars
upon
either
side

frodo
found
himself
walking
with
gandalf
this
is
the
hall
of
fire'
said
the
wizard
here
you
will
hear
many
songs
and
talesif
you
can
keep
awake
but
except
on
high
days
it
usually
stands
empty
and
quiet
and
people
come
here
who
wish
for
peace
and
thought
there
is
always
a
fire
here
all
the
year
round
but
there
is
little
other
light'

as
elrond
entered
and
went
towards
the
seat
prepared
for
him
elvish
minstrels
began
to
make
sweet
music
slowly
the
hall
filled
and
frodo
looked
with
delight
upon
the
many
fair
faces
that
were
gathered
together
the
golden
firelight
played
upon
them
and
shimmered
in
their
hair
suddenly
he
noticed
not
far
from
the
further
end
of
the
fire
a
small
dark
figure
seated
on
a
stool
with
his
back
propped
against
a
pillar
beside
him
on
the
ground
was
a
drinkingcup
and
some
bread
frodo
wondered
whether
he
was
ill
if
people
were
ever
ill
in
rivendell
and
had
been
unable
to
come
to
the
feast
his
head
seemed
sunk
in
sleep
on
his
breast
and
a
fold
of
his
dark
cloak
was
drawn
over
his
face

elrond
went
forward
and
stood
beside
the
silent
figure
'awake
little
master
he
said
with
a
smile
then
turning
to
frodo
he
beckoned
to
him
'now
at
last
the
hour
has
come
that
you
have
wished
for
frodo'
he
said
here
is
a
friend
that
you
have
long
missed'

the
dark
figure
raised
its
head
and
uncovered
its
face

bilbo'
cried
frodo
with
sudden
recognition
and
he
sprang
forward

hullo
frodo
my
lad'
said
bilbo
so
you
have
got
here
at
last
I
hoped
you
would
manage
it
well
well
so
all
this
feasting
is
in
your
honour
I
hear
I
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself'

'why
weren't
you
there'
cried
frodo
and
why
haven't
I
been
allowed
to
see
you
before'

because
you
were
asleep
I
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
you
I
have
sat
by
your
side
with
sam
each
day
but
as
for
the
feast
I
don't
go
in
for
such
things
much
now
and
I
had
something
else
to
do'

what
were
you
doing'

why
sitting
and
thinking
I
do
a
lot
of
that
nowadays
and
this
is
the
best
place
to
do
it
in
as
a
rule
wake
up
indeed'
he
said
cocking
an
eye
at
elrond
there
was
a
bright
twinkle
in
it
and
no
sign
of
sleepiness
that
frodo
could
see
wake
up
I
was
not
asleep
master
elrond
if
you
want
to
know
you
have
all
come
out
from
your
feast
too
soon
and
you
have
disturbed
mein
the
middle
of
making
up
a
song
I
was
stuck
over
a
line
or
two
and
was
thinking
about
them
but
now
I
don't
suppose
I
shall
ever
get
them
right
there
will
be
such
a
deal
of
singing
that
the
ideas
will
be
driven
clean
out
of
my
head
I
shall
have
to
get
my
friend
the
dnadan
to
help
me
where
is
he'


elrond
laughed
he
shall
be
found'
he
said
then
you
two
shall
go
into
a
corner
and
finish
your
task
and
we
will
hear
it
and
judge
it
before
we
end
our
merrymaking'
messengers
were
sent
to
find
bilbo's
friend
though
none
knew
where
he
was
or
why
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
feast

in
the
meanwhile
frodo
and
bilbo
sat
side
by
side
and
sam
came
quickly
and
placed
himself
near
them
they
talked
together
in
soft
voices
oblivious
of
the
mirth
and
music
in
the
hall
about
them
bilbo
had
not
much
to
say
of
himself
when
he
had
left
hobbiton
he
had
wandered
off
aimlessly
along
the
road
or
in
the
country
on
either
side
but
somehow
he
had
steered
all
the
time
towards
rivendell
I
got
here
without
much
adventure'
he
said
and
after
a
rest
I
went
on
with
the
dwarves
to
dale
my
last
journey
I
shan't
travel
again
old
balin
had
gone
away
then
I
came
back
here
and
here
I
have
been
I
have
done
this
and
that
I
have
written
some
more
of
my
book
and
of
course
I
make
up
a
few
songs
they
sing
them
occasionally
just
to
please
me
I
think
for
of
course
they
aren't
really
good
enough
for
rivendell
and
I
listen
and
I
think
time
doesn't
seem
to
pass
here
it
just
is
a
remarkable
place
altogether

I
hear
all
kinds
of
news
from
over
the
mountains
and
out
of
the
south
but
hardly
anything
from
the
shire
I
heard
about
the
ring
of
course
gandalf
has
been
here
often
not
that
he
has
told
me
a
great
deal
he
has
become
closer
than
ever
these
last
few
years
the
dnadan
has
told
me
more
fancy
that
ring
of
mine
causing
such
a
disturbance
it
is
a
pity
that
gandalf
did
not
find
out
more
sooner
I
could
have
brought
the
thing
here
myself
long
ago
without
so
much
trouble
I
have
thought
several
times
of
going
back
to
hobbiton
for
it
but
I
am
getting
old
and
they
would
not
let
me
gandalf
and
elrond
I
mean
they
seemed
to
think
that
the
enemy
was
looking
high
and
low
for
me
and
would
make
mincemeat
of
me
if
he
caught
me
tottering
about
in
the
wild

'and
gandalf
said
the
ring
has
passed
on
bilbo
it
would
do
no
good
to
you
or
to
others
if
you
tried
to
meddle
with
it
again
odd
sort
of
remark
just
like
gandalf
but
he
said
he
was
looking
after
you
so
I
let
things
be
I
am
frightfully
glad
to
see
you
safe
and
sound'
he
paused
and
looked
at
frodo
doubtfully

have
you
got
it
here'
he
asked
in
a
whisper
I
can't
help
feeling
curious
you
know
after
all
i've
heard
I
should
very
much
like
just
to
peep
at
it
again'

yes
i've
got
it'
answered
frodo
feeling
a
strange
reluctance
it
looks
just
the
same
as
ever
it
did'

well
I
should
just
like
to
see
it
for
a
moment'
said
bilbo

when
he
had
dressed
frodo
found
that
while
he
slept
the
ring
had
been
hung
about
his
neck
on
a
new
chain
light
but
strong
slowly
he
drew
it
out
bilbo
put
out
his
hand
but
frodo
quickly
drew
back
the
ring
to
his
distress
and
amazement
he
found
that
he
was
no
longer
looking
at
bilbo
a
shadow
seemed
to
have
fallen
between
them
and
through
it
he
found
himself
eyeing
a
little
wrinkled
creature
with
a
hungry
face
and
bony
groping
hands
he
felt
a
desire
to
strike
him

the
music
and
singing
round
them
seemed
to
falter
and
a
silence
fell
bilbo
looked
quickly
at
frodo's
face
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
I
understand
now'
he
said
put
it
away
I
am
sorry
sorry
you
have
come
in
for
this
burden
sorry
about
everything
don't
adventures
ever
have
an
end
I
suppose
not
someone
else
always
has
to
carry
on
the
story
well
it
can't
be
helped
I
wonder
if
it's
any
good
trying
to
finish
my
book
but
don't
let's
worry
about
it
nowlet's
have
some
real
news
tell
me
all
about
the
shire'

frodo
hid
the
ring
away
and
the
shadow
passed
leaving
hardly
a
shred
of
memory
the
light
and
music
of
rivendell
was
about
him
again
bilbo
smiled
and
laughed
happily
every
item
of
news
from
the
shire
that
frodo
could
tellaided
and
corrected
now
and
again
by
samwas
of
the
greatest
interest
to
him
from
the
felling
of
the
least
tree
to
the
pranks
of
the
smallest
child
in
hobbiton
they
were
so
deep
in
the
doings
of
the
four
farthings
that
they
did
not
notice
the
arrival
of
a
man
clad
in
dark
green
cloth
for
many
minutes
he
stood
looking
down
at
them
with
a
smile

suddenly
bilbo
looked
up
'ah
there
you
are
at
last
dnadan'
he
cried

strider'
said
frodo
you
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
names'


well

strider

is
one
that
I
haven't
heard
before
anyway'
said
bilbo
what
do
you
call
him

that
for'
they
call
me
that
in
bree'
said
strider
laughing
'and
that
is
how
I
was
introduced
to
him'
and
why
do
you
call
him
dnadan'
asked
frodo

the

dnadan'
said
bilbo
he
is
often
called
that
here
but
I
thought
you
knew
enough

elvish
at
least
to
know

dnudan

man
of
the
west
nmenorean
but
this
is
not
the
time
for

lessons'
he
turned
to
strider
where
have
you
been
my
friend
why
weren't
you
at
the
feast
the
lady
arwen
was
there'
strider
looked
down
at
bilbo
gravely
I
know'
he
said
'but
often
I
must
put
mirth
aside

elladan
and
elrohir
have
returned
out
of
the
wild
unlookedfor
and
they
had
tidings
that
I
wished
to
hear
at
once'

well
my
dear
fellow'
said
bilbo
now
you've
heard
the
news
can't
you
spare
me
a
moment
I
want
your
help
in
something
urgent
elrond
says
this
song
of
mine
is
to
be
finished
before
the
end
of
the
evening
and
I
am
stuck
let's
go
off
into
a
corner
and
polish
it
up'

strider
smiled
come
then'
he
said
let
me
hear
it'

frodo
was
left
to
himself
for
a
while
for
sam
had
fallen
asleep
he
was
alone
and
felt
rather
forlorn
although
all
about
him
the
folk
of
rivendell
were
gathered
but
those
near
him
were
silent
intent
upon
the
music
of
the
voices
and
the
instruments
and
they
gave
no
heed
to
anything
else
frodo
began
to
listen

at
first
the
beauty
of
the
melodies
and
of
the
interwoven
words
in
elventongues
even
though
he
understood
them
little
held
him
in
a
spell
as
soon
as
he
began
to
attend
to
them
almost
it
seemed
that
the
words
took
shape
and
visions
of
far
lands
and
bright
things
that
he
had
never
yet
imagined
opened
out
before
him
and
the
firelit
hall
became
like
a
golden
mist
above
seas
of
foam
that
sighed
upon
the
margins
of
the
world
then
the
enchantment
became
more
and
more
dreamlike
until
he
felt
that
an
endless
river
of
swelling
gold
and
silver
was
flowing
over
him
too
multitudinous
for
its
pattern
to
be
comprehended
it
became
part
of
the
throbbing
air
about
him
and
it
drenched
and
drowned
him
swiftly
he
sank
under
its
shining
weight
into
a
deep
realm
of
sleep

there
he
wandered
long
in
a
dream
of
music
that
turned
into
running
water
and
then
suddenly
into
a
voice
it
seemed
to
be
the
voice
of
bilbo
chanting
verses
faint
at
first
and
then
clearer
ran
the
words

erendil
was
a
mariner

that
tarried
in
arvernien

he
built
a
boat
of
timber
felled

in
nimbrethil
to
journey
in

her
sails
he
wove
of
silver
fair

of
silver
were
her
lanterns
made

her
prow
was
fashioned
like
a
swan

and
light
upon
her
banners
laid


in
panoply
of
ancient
kings

in
chaind
rings
he
armoured
him

his
shining
shield
was
scored
with
runes

to
ward
all
wounds
and
harm
from
him

his
bow
was
made
of
dragonhorn

his
arrows
shorn
of
ebony

of
silver
was
his
habergeon

his
scabbard
of
chalcedony

his
sword
of
steel
was
valiant



of
adamant
his
helmet
tall
an
eagleplume
upon
his
crest
upon
his
breast
an
emerald

beneath
the
moon
and
under
star
he
wandered
far
from
northern
strands
bewildered
on
enchanted
ways
beyond
the
days
of
mortal
lands
from
gnashing
of
the
narrow
ice
where
shadow
lies
on
frozen
hills
from
nether
heats
and
burning
waste
he
turned
in
haste
and
roving
still
on
starless
waters
far
astray
at
last
he
came
to
night
of
naught
and
passed
and
never
sight
he
saw
of
shining
shore
nor
light
he
sought

the
winds
of
wrath
came
driving
him
and
blindly
in
the
foam
he
fled
from
west
to
east
and
errandless
unheralded
he
homeward
sped

there
flying
elwing
came
to
him
and
flame
was
in
the
darkness
lit
more
bright
than
light
of
diamond
the
fire
upon
her
carcanet
the
silmaril
she
bound
on
him
and
crowned
him
with
the
living
light
and
dauntless
then
with
burning
brow
he
turned
his
prow
and
in
the
night
from
otherworld
beyond
the
sea
there
strong
and
free
a
storm
arose
a
wind
of
power
in
tarmenel
by
paths
that
seldom
mortal
goes
his
boat
it
bore
with
biting
breath
as
might
of
death
across
the
grey
and
longforsaken
seas
distressed
from
east
to
west
he
passed
away

through
evernight
he
back
was
borne
on
black
and
roaring
waves
that
ran
o'er
leagues
unlit
and
foundered
shores
that
drowned
before
the
days
began
until
he
heard
on
strands
of
pearl
when
ends
the
world
the
music
long
where
ever
foaming
billows
roll
the
yellow
gold
and
jewels
wan
he
saw
the
mountain
silent
rise
where
twilight
lies
upon
the
knees
of
valinor
and
eldamar

beheld
afar
beyond
the
seas
a
wanderer
escaped
from
night
to
haven
white
he
came
at
last
to
elvenhome
the
green
and
fair
where
keen
the
air
where
pale
as
glass
beneath
the
hill
of
ilmarin
aglimmer
in
a
valley
sheer
the
lamplit
towers
of
tirion
are
mirrored
on
the
shadowmere

he
tarried
there
from
errantry
and
melodies
they
taught
to
him
and
sages
old
him
marvels
told
and
harps
of
gold
they
brought
to
him
they
clothed
him
then
in
elvenwhite
and
seven
lights
before
him
sent
as
through
the
calacirian
to
hidden
land
forlorn
he
went
he
came
unto
the
timeless
halls
where
shining
fall
the
countless
years
and
endless
reigns
theelder
king
in
ilmarin
on
mountain
sheer
and
words
unheard
were
spoken
then
of
folk
of
men
and
elvenkin
beyond
the
world
were
visions
showed
forbid
to
those
that
dwell
therein

a
ship
then
new
they
built
for
him
of
mithril
and
of
elvenglass
with
shining
prow
no
shaven
oar
nor
sail
she
bore
on
silver
mast
the
silmaril
as
lantern
light
and
banner
bright
with
living
flame
to
gleam
thereon
by
elbereth
herself
was
set
who
thither
came
and
wings
immortal
made
for
him
and
laid
on
him
undying
doom
to
sail
the
shoreless
skies
and
come
behind
the
sun
and
light
of
moon

from
evereven's
lofty
hills
where
softly
silver
fountains
fall
his
wings
him
bore
a
wandering
light
beyond
the
mighty
mountain
wall
from
world's
end
then
he
turned
away
and
yearned
again
to
find
afar
his
home
through
shadows
journeying
and
burning
as
an
island
star
on
high
above
the
mists
he
came
a
distant
flame
before
the
sun

a
wonder
ere
the
waking
dawn

where
grey
the
norland
waters
run

and
over
middleearth
he
passed

and
heard
at
last
the
weeping
sore

of
women
and
of
elvenmaids

in
elder
days
in
years
of
yore

gut
on
him
mighty
doom
was
laid

till
moon
should
fade
an
orbd
star

to
pass
and
tarry
never
more

on
hither
shores
where
mortals
are

for
ever
still
a
herald
on

an
errand
that
should
never
rest

to
bear
his
shining
lamp
afar

the
flammifer
of
westernesse

the
chanting
ceased
frodo
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
bilbo
was
seated
on
his
stool
in
a
circle
of
listeners
who
were
smiling
and
applauding

now
we
had
better
have
it
again'
said
an
elf

bilbo
got
up
and
bowed
I
am
flattered
lindir'
he
said
'but
it
would
be
too
tiring
to
repeat
it
all'

'not
too
tiring
for
you'
the
elves
answered
laughing
'you
know
you
are
never
tired
of
reciting
your
own
verses
but
really
we
cannot
answer
your
question
at
one
hearing'

what'
cried
bilbo
'you
can't
tell
which
parts
were
mine
and
which
were
the
dnadan's'

'it
is
not
easy
for
us
to
tell
the
difference
between
two
mortals'
said
the
elf

'nonsense
lindir'
snorted
bilbo
'if
you
can't
distinguish
between
a
man
and
a
hobbit
your
judgement
is
poorer
than
I
imagined
they're
as
different
as
peas
and
apples'

'maybe
to
sheep
other
sheep
no
doubt
appear
different'
laughed
lindir
or
to
shepherds
but
mortals
have
not
been
our
study
we
have
other
business'

'i
won't
argue
with
you'
said
bilbo
'i
am
sleepy
after
so
much
music
and
singing
i'll
leave
you
to
guess
if
you
want
to'

he
got
up
and
came
towards
frodo
'well
that's
over'
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
went
off
better
than
I
expected
I
don't
often
get
asked
for
a
second
hearing
what
did
you
think
of
it'

I
am
not
going
to
try
and
guess'
said
frodo
smiling

you
needn't'
said
bilbo
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
all
mine
except
that
aragorn
insisted
on
my
putting
in
a
green
stone
he
seemed
to
think
it
important
I
don't
know
why
otherwise
he
obviously
thought
the
whole
thing
rather
above
my
head
and
he
said
that
if
I
had
the
cheek
to
make
verses
about
erendil
in
the
house
of
elrond
it
was
my
affair
I
suppose
he
was
right'

'i
don't
know'
said
frodo
it
seemed
to
me
to
fit
somehow
though
I
can't
explain
I
was
half
asleep
when
you
began
and
it
seemed
to
follow
on
from
something
that
I
was
dreaming
about
I
didn't
understand
that
it
was
really
you
speaking
until
near
the
end'

it

is

difficult
to
keep
awake
here
until
you
get
used
to
it'
said
bilbo
'not
that
hobbits
would
ever
acquire
quite
the
elvish
appetite
for
music
and
poetry
and
tales
they
seem
to
like
them
as
much
as
food
or
more
they
will
be
going
on
for
a
long
time
yet
what
do
you
say
to
slipping
off
for
some
more
quiet
talk'

can
we'
said
frodo

of
course
this
is
merrymaking
not
business
come
and
go
as
you
like
as
long
as
you
don't
make
a
noise'


they
got
up
and
withdrew
quietly
into
the
shadows
and
made
for
the
doors
sam
they
left
behind
fast
asleep
still
with
a
smile
on
his
face
in
spite
of
his
delight
in
bilbo's
company
frodo
felt
a
tug
of
regret
as
they
passed
out
of
the
hall
of
fire
even
as
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
a
single
clear
voice
rose
in
song

frodo
halted
for
a
moment
looking
back
elrond
was
in
his
chair
and
the
fire
was
on
his
face
like
summerlight
upon
the
trees
near
him
sat
the
lady
arwen
to
his
surprise
frodo
saw
that
aragorn
stood
beside
her
his
dark
cloak
was
thrown
back
and
he
seemed
to
be
clad
in
elvenmail
and
a
star
shone
on
his
breast
they
spoke
together
and
then
suddenly
it
seemed
to
frodo
that
arwen
turned
towards
him
and
the
light
of
her
eyes
fell
on
him
from
afar
and
pierced
his
heart

he
stood
still
enchanted
while
the
sweet
syllables
of
the
elvish
song
fell
like
clear
jewels
of
blended
word
and
melody
it
is
a
song
to
elbereth'
said
bilbo
they
will
sing
that
and
other
songs
of
the
blessed
realm
many
times
tonight
come
on'

he
led
frodo
back
to
his
own
little
room
it
opened
on
to
the
gar
dens
and
looked
south
across
the
ravine
of
the
bruinen
there
they
sat
for
some
while
looking
through
the
window
at
the
bright
stars
above
the
steepclimbing
woods
and
talking
softly
they
spoke
no
more
of
the
small
news
of
the
shire
far
away
nor
of
the
dark
shadows
and
perils
that
encompassed
them
but
of
the
fair
things
they
had
seen
in
the
world
together
of
the
elves
of
the
stars
of
trees
and
the
gentle
fall
of
the
bright
year
in
the
woods

at
last
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
begging
your
pardon'
said
sam
putting
in
his
head
but
I
was
just
wondering
if
you
would
be
wanting
anything'

and
begging
yours
sam
gamgee'
replied
bilbo
I
guess
you
mean
that
it
is
time
your
master
went
to
bed'

well
sir
there
is
a
council
early
tomorrow
I
hear
and
he
only
got
up
today
for
the
first
time'

quite
right
sam'
laughed
bilbo
you
can
trot
off
and
tell
gandalf
that
he
has
gone
to
bed
good
night
frodo
bless
me
but
it
has
been
good
to
see
you
again
there
are
no
folk
like
hobbits
after
all
for
a
real
good
talk
I
am
getting
very
old
and
I
began
to
wonder
if
I
should
ever
live
to
see
your
chapters
of
our
story
good
night
i'll
take
a
walk
I
think
and
look
at
the
stars
of
elbereth
in
the
garden
sleep
well'


chapter
2


the
council
of
elrond


next
day
frodo
woke
early
feeling
refreshed
and
well
he
walked
along
the
terraces
above
the
loudflowing
bruinen
and
watched
the
pale
cool
sun
rise
above
the
far
mountains
and
shine
down
slanting
through
the
thin
silver
mist
the
dew
upon
the
yellow
leaves
was
glimmering
and
the
woven
nets
of
gossamer
twinkled
on
every
bush
sam
walked
beside
him
saying
nothing
but
sniffing
the
air
and
looking
every
now
and
again
with
wonder
in
his
eyes
at
the
great
heights
in
the
east
the
snow
was
white
upon
their
peaks


on
a
seat
cut
in
the
stone
beside
a
turn
in
the
path
they
came
upon
gandalf
and
bilbo
deep
in
talk
hullo
good
morning'
said
bilbo
feel
ready
for
the
great
council'

I
feel
ready
for
anything'
answered
frodo
but
most
of
all
I
should
like
to
go
walking
today
and
explore
the
valley
I
should
like
to
get
into
those
pinewoods
up
there'
he
pointed
away
far
up
the
side
of
rivendell
to
the
north

'you
may
have
a
chance
later'
said
gandalf
but
we
cannot
make
any
plans
yet
there
is
much
to
hear
and
decide
today'

suddenly
as
they
were
talking
a
single
clear
bell
rang
out
that
is
the
warning
bell
for
the
council
of
elrond'
cried
gandalf
come
along
now
both
you
and
bilbo
are
wanted'

frodo
and
bilbo
followed
the
wizard
quickly
along
the
winding
path
back
to
the
house
behind
them
uninvited
and
for
the
moment
forgotten
trotted
sam

gandalf
led
them
to
the
porch
where
frodo
had
found
his
friends
the
evening
before
the
light
of
the
clear
autumn
morning
was
now
glowing
in
the
valley
the
noise
of
bubbling
waters
came
up
from
the
foaming
riverbed
birds
were
singing
and
a
wholesome
peace
lay
on
the
land
to
frodo
his
dangerous
flight
and
the
rumours
of
the
darkness
growing
in
the
world
outside
already
seemed
only
the
memories
of
a
troubled
dream
but
the
faces
that
were
turned
to
meet
them
as
they
entered
were
grave

elrond
was
there
and
several
others
were
seated
in
silence
about
him
frodo
saw
glorfindel
and
glin
and
in
a
corner
alone
strider
was
sitting
clad
in
his
old
travelworn
clothes
again
elrond
drew
frodo
to
a
seat
by
his
side
and
presented
him
to
the
company
saying

'here
my
friends
is
the
hobbit
frodo
son
of
drogo
few
have
ever
come
hither
through
greater
peril
or
on
an
errand
more
urgent'

he
then
pointed
out
and
named
those
whom
frodo
had
not
met
before
there
was
a
younger
dwarf
at
glin's
side
his
son
gimli
beside
glorfindel
there
were
several
other
counsellors
of
elrond's
household
of
whom
erestor
was
the
chief
and
with
him
was
galdor
an
elf
from
the
grey
havens
who
had
come
on
an
errand
from
crdan
the
shipwright
there
was
also
a
strange
elf
clad
in
green
and
brown
legolas
a
messenger
from
his
father
thranduil
the
king
of
the
elves
of
northern
mirkwood
and
seated
a
little
apart
was
a
tall
man
with
a
fair
and
noble
face
darkhaired
and
greyeyed
proud
and
stern
of
glance

he
was
cloaked
and
booted
as
if
for
a
journey
on
horseback
and
indeed
though
his
garments
were
rich
and
his
cloak
was
lined
with
fur
they
were
stained
with
long
travel
he
had
a
collar
of
silver
in
which
a
single
white
stone
was
set
his
locks
were
shorn
about
his
shoulders
on
a
baldric
he
wore
a
great
horn
tipped
with
silver
that
now
was
laid
upon
his
knees
he
gazed
at
frodo
and
bilbo
with
sudden
wonder

here'
said
elrond
turning
to
gandalf
is
boromir
a
man
from
the
south
he
arrived
in
the
grey
morning
and
seeks
for
counsel
I
have
bidden
him
to
be
present
for
here
his
questions
will
be
answered'

not
all
that
was
spoken
and
debated
in
the
council
need
now
be
told
much
was
said
of
events
in
the
world
outside
especially
in
the
south
and
in
the
wide
lands
east
of
the
mountains
of
these
things
frodo
had
already
heard
many
rumours
but
the
tale
of
glin
was
new
to
him
and
when
the
dwarf
spoke
he
listened
attentively
it
appeared
that
amid
the
splendour
of
their
works
of
hand
the
hearts
of
the
dwarves
of
the
lonely
mountain
were
troubled

it
is
now
many
years
ago'
said
glin
that
a
shadow
of
disquiet
fell
upon
our
people
whence
it
came
we
did
not
at
first
perceive
words
began
to
be
whispered
in
secret
it
was
said
that
we
were
hemmed
in
a
narrow
place
and
that
greater
wealth
and
splendour
would
be
found
in
a
wider
world
some
spoke
of
moria
the
mighty
works
of
our
fathers
that
are
called
in
our
own
tongue
khazaddm
and
they
declared
that
now
at
last
we
had
the
power
and
numbers
to
return'

glin
sighed
moria
moria
wonder
of
the
northern
world
too
deep
we
delved
there
and
woke
the
nameless
fear
long
have
its
vast
mansions
lain
empty
since
the
children
of
durin
fled
but
now
we
spoke
of
it
again
with
longing
and
yet
with
dread
for
no
dwarf
has
dared
to
pass
the
doors
of
khazaddm
for
many
lives
of
kings
save
thrr
only
and
he
perished
at
last
however
balin
listened
to
the
whispers
and
resolved
to
go
and
though
din
did
not
give
leave
willingly
he
took
with
him
ori
and
in
and
many
of
our
folk
and
they
went
away
south

that
was
nigh
on
thirty
years
ago
for
a
while
we
had
news
and
it
seemed
good
messages
reported
that
moria
had
been
entered
and
a
great
work
begun
there
then
there
was
silence
and
no
word
has
ever
come
from
moria
since

then
about
a
year
ago
a
messenger
came
to
din
but
not
from
moria

from
mordor
a
horseman
in
the
night
who
called
din
to
his
gate
the
lord
sauron
the
great
so
he
said
wished
for
our
friendship
rings
he
would
give
for
it
such
as
he
gave
of
old
and
he
asked
urgently
concerning

hobbits

of
what
kind
they
were
and
where
they
dwelt
for
sauron
knows
said
he
that
one
of
these
was
known
to
you
on
a
time

'at
this
we
were
greatly
troubled
and
we
gave
no
answer
and
then
his
fell
voice
was
lowered
and
he
would
have
sweetened
it
if
he
could
as
a
small
token
only
of
your
friendship
sauron
asks
this
he
said
that
you
should
find
this
thief
such
was
his
word
and
get
from
him
willing
or
no
a
little
ring
the
least
of
rings
that
once
he
stole
it
is
but
a
trifle
that
sauron
fancies
and
an
earnest
of
your
good
will
find
it
and
three
rings
that
the
dwarf
sires
possessed
of
old
shall
be
returned
to
you
and
the
realm
of
moria
shall
be
yours
for
ever
find
only
news
of
the
thief
whether
he
still
lives
and
where
and
you
shall
have
great
reward
and
lasting
friendship
from
the
lord
refuse
and
things
will
not
seem
so
well
do
you
refuse

'at
that
his
breath
came
like
the
hiss
of
snakes
and
all
who
stood
by
shuddered
but
din
said
I
say
neither
yea
nor
nay
I
must
consider
this
message
and
what
it
means
under
its
fair
cloak

'
consider
well
but
not
too
long
said
he

'
the
time
of
my
thought
is
my
own
to
spend
answered
din

'
for
the
present
said
he
and
rode
into
the
darkness

'heavy
have
the
hearts
of
our
chieftains
been
since
that
night
we
needed
not
the
fell
voice
of
the
messenger
to
warn
us
that
his
words
held
both
menace
and
deceit
for
we
knew
already
that
the
power
that
has
reentered
mordor
has
not
changed
and
ever
it
betrayed
us
of
old
twice
the
messenger
has
returned
and
has
gone
unanswered
the
third
and
last
time
so
he
says
is
soon
to
come
before
the
ending
of
the
year

'and
so
I
have
been
sent
at
last
by
din
to
warn
bilbo
that
he
is
sought
by
the
enemy
and
to
learn
if
may
be
why
he
desires
this
ring
this
least
of
rings
also
we
crave
the
advice
of
elrond
for
the
shadow
grows
and
draws
nearer
we
discover
that
messengers
have
come
also
to
king
brand
in
dale
and
that
he
is
afraid
we
fear
that
he
may
yield
already
war
is
gathering
on
his
eastern
borders
if
we
make
no
answer
the
enemy
may
move
men
of
his
rule
to
assail
king
brand
and
din
also'

you
have
done
well
to
come'
said
elrond
you
will
hear
today
all
that
you
need
in
order
to
understand
the
purposes
of
the
enemy
there
is
naught
that
you
can
do
other
than
to
resist
with
hope
or
without
it
but
you
do
not
stand
alone
you
will
learn
that
your
trouble
is
but
part
of
the
trouble
of
all
the
western
world
the
ring
what
shall
we
do
with
the
ring
the
least
of
rings
the
trifle
that
sauron
fancies
that
is
the
doom
that
we
must
deem

that
is
the
purpose
for
which
you
are
called
hither
called
I
say
though
I
have
not
called
you
to
me
strangers
from
distant
lands
you
have
come
and
are
here
met
in
this
very
nick
of
time
by
chance
as
it
may
seem
yet
it
is
not
so
believe
rather
that
it
is
so
ordered
that
we
who
sit
here
and
none
others
must
now
find
counsel
for
the
peril
of
the
world

now
therefore
things
shall
be
openly
spoken
that
have
been
hidden
from
all
but
a
few
until
this
day
and
first
so
that
all
may
understand
what
is
the
peril
the
tale
of
the
ring
shall
be
told
from
the
beginning
even
to
this
present
and
I
will
begin
that
tale
though
others
shall
end
it'

then
all
listened
while
elrond
in
his
clear
voice
spoke
of
sauron
and
the
rings
of
power
and
their
forging
in
the
second
age
of
the
world
long
ago
a
part
of
his
tale
was
known
to
some
there
but
the
full
tale
to
none
and
many
eyes
were
turned
t
elrond
in
fear
and
wonder
as
he
told
of
the
elvensmiths
of
eregion
and
their
friendship
with
moria
and
their
eagerness
for
knowledge
by
which
sauron
ensnared
them
for
in
that
time
he
was
not
yet
evil
to
behold
and
they
received
his
aid
and
grew
mighty
in
craft
whereas
he
learned
all
their
secrets
and
betrayed
them
and
forged
secretly
in
the
mountain
of
fire
the
one
ring
to
be
their
master
but
celebrimbor
was
aware
of
him
and
hid
the
three
which
he
had
made
and
there
was
war
and
the
land
was
laid
waste
and
the
gate
of
moria
was
shut

then
through
all
the
years
that
followed
he
traced
the
ring
but
since
that
history
is
elsewhere
recounted
even
as
elrond
himself
set
it
down
in
his
books
of
lore
it
is
not
here
recalled
for
it
is
a
long
tale
full
of
deeds
great
and
terrible
and
briefly
though
elrond
spoke
the
sun
rode
up
the
sky
and
the
morning
was
passing
ere
he
ceased

of
nmenor
he
spoke
its
glory
and
its
fall
and
the
return
of
the
kings
of
men
to
middleearth
out
of
the
deeps
of
the
sea
borne
upon
the
wings
of
storm
then
elendil
the
tall
and
his
mighty
sons
isildur
and
anrion
became
great
lords
and
the
northrealm
they
made
in
arnor
and
the
southrealm
in
gondor
above
the
mouths
of
anduin
but
sauron
of
mordor
assailed
them
and
they
made
the
last
alliance
of
elves
and
men
and
the
hosts
of
gilgalad
and
elendil
were
mustered
in
arnor

thereupon
elrond
paused
a
while
and
sighed
I
remember
well
the
splendour
of
their
banners'
he
said
it
recalled
to
me
the
glory
of
the
elder
days
and
the
hosts
of
beleriand
so
many
great
princes
and
captains
were
assembled
and
yet
not
so
many
nor
so
fair
as
when
thangorodrim
was
broken
and
the
elves
deemed
that
evil
was
ended
for
ever
and
it
was
not
so'

you
remember'
said
frodo
speaking
his
thought
aloud
in
his
astonishment
but
I
thought'
he
stammered
as
elrond
turned
towards
him
'i
thought
that
the
fall
of
gilgalad
was
a
long
age
ago'

'so
it
was
indeed'
answered
elrond
gravely
but
my
memory
reaches
back
even
to
the
elder
days
erendil
was
my
sire
who
was
born
in
gondolin
before
its
fall
and
my
mother
was
elwing
daughter
of
dior
son
of
lthien
of
doriath
I
have
seen
three
ages
in
the
west
of
the
world
and
many
defeats
and
many
fruitless
victories

I
was
the
herald
of
gilgalad
and
marched
with
his
host
I
was
at
the
battle
of
dagorlad
before
the
black
gate
of
mordor
where
we
had
the
mastery
for
the
spear
of
gilgalad
and
the
sword
of
elendil
aiglos
and
narsil
none
could
withstand
I
beheld
the
last
combat
on
the
slopes
of
orodruin
where
gilgalad
died
and
elendil
fell
and
narsil
broke
beneath
him
but
sauron
himself
was
overthrown
and
isildur
cut
the
ring
from
his
hand
with
the
hiltshard
of
his
father's
sword
and
took
it
for
his
own'

at
this
the
stranger
boromir
broke
in
so
that
is
what
became
of
the
ring'
he
cried
if
ever
such
a
tale
was
told
in
the
south
it
has
long
been
forgotten
I
have
heard
of
the
great
ring
of
him
that
we
do
not
name
but
we
believed
that
it
perished
from
the
world
in
the
ruin
of
his
first
realm
isildur
took
it
that
is
tidings
indeed'

alas
yes'
said
elrond
isildur
took
it
as
should
not
have
been
it
should
have
been
cast
then
into
orodruin's
fire
nigh
at
hand
where
it
was
made
but
few
marked
what
isildur
did
he
alone
stood
by
his
father
in
that
last
mortal
contest
and
by
gilgalad
only
crdan
stood
and
I
but
isildur
would
not
listen
to
our
counsel

'
this
I
will
have
as
weregild
for
my
father
and
my
brother
he
said
and
therefore
whether
we
would
or
no
he
took
it
to
treasure
it
but
soon
he
was
betrayed
by
it
to
his
death
and
so
it
is
named
in
the
north
isildur's
bane
yet
death
maybe
was
better
than
what
else
might
have
befallen
him

'only
to
the
north
did
these
tidings
come
and
only
to
a
few
small
wonder
it
is
that
you
have
not
heard
them
boromir
from
the
ruin
of
the
gladden
fields
where
isildur
perished
three
men
only
came
ever
back
over
the
mountains
after
long
wandering
one
of
these
was
ohtar
the
esquire
of
isildur
who
bore
the
shards
of
the
sword
of
elendil
and
he
brought
them
to
valandil
the
heir
of
isildur
who
being
but
a
child
had
remained
here
in
rivendell
but
narsil
was
broken
and
its
light
extinguished
and
it
has
not
yet
been
forged
again


fruitless
did
I
call
the
victory
of
the
last
alliance
not
wholly
so
yet
it
did
not
achieve
its
end
sauron
was
diminished
but
not
destroyed
his
ring
was
lost
but
not
unmade
the
dark
tower
was
broken
but
its
foundations
were
not
removed
for
they
were
made
with
the
power
of
the
ring
and
while
it
remains
they
will
endure
many
elves
and
many
mighty
men
and
many
of
their
friends
had
perished
in
the
war
anrion
was
slain
and
isildur
was
slain
and
gilgalad
and
elendil
were
no
more
never
again
shall
there
be
any
such
league
of
elves
and
men
for
men
multiply
and
the
firstborn
decrease
and
the
two
kindreds
are
estranged
and
ever
since
that
day
the
race
of
nmenor
has
decayed
and
the
span
of
their
years
has
lessened

'in
the
north
after
the
war
and
the
slaughter
of
the
gladden
fields
the
men
of
westernesse
were
diminished
and
their
city
of
annminas
beside
lake
evendim
fell
into
ruin
and
the
heirs
of
valandil
removed
and
dwelt
at
fornost
on
the
high
north
downs
and
that
now
too
is
desolate
men
call
it
deadmen's
dike
and
they
fear
to
tread
there
for
the
folk
of
arnor
dwindled
and
their
foes
devoured
them
and
their
lordship
passed
leaving
only
green
mounds
in
the
grassy
hills

'in
the
south
the
realm
of
gondor
long
endured
and
for
a
while
its
splendour
grew
recalling
somewhat
of
the
might
of
nmenor
ere
it
fell
high
towers
that
people
built
and
strong
places
and
havens
of
many
ships
and
the
winged
crown
of
the
kings
of
men
was
held
in
awe
by
folk
of
many
tongues
their
chief
city
was
osgiliath
citadel
of
the
stars
through
the
midst
of
which
the
river
flowed
and
minas
ithil
they
built
tower
of
the
rising
moon
eastward
upon
a
shoulder
of
the
mountains
of
shadow
and
westward
at
the
feet
of
the
white
mountains
minas
anor
they
made
tower
of
the
setting
sun
there
in
the
courts
of
the
king
grew
a
white
tree
from
the
seed
of
that
tree
which
isildur
brought
over
the
deep
waters
and
the
seed
of
that
tree
before
came
from
eressa
and
before
that
out
of
the
uttermost
west
in
the
day
before
days
when
the
world
was
young

but
in
the
wearing
of
the
swift
years
of
middleearth
the
line
of
meneldil
son
of
anrion
failed
and
the
tree
withered
and
the
blood
of
the
nmenoreans
became
mingled
with
that
of
lesser
men
then
the
watch
upon
the
walls
of
mordor
slept
and
dark
things
crept
back
to
gorgoroth
and
on
a
time
evil
things
came
forth
and
they
took
minas
ithil
and
abode
in
it
and
they
made
it
into
a
place
of
dread
and
it
is
called
minas
morgul
the
tower
of
sorcery
then
minas
anor
was
named
anew
minas
tirith
the
tower
of
guard
and
these
two
cities
were
ever
at
war
but
osgiliath
which
lay
between
was
deserted
and
in
its
ruins
shadows
walked

'so
it
has
been
for
many
lives
of
men
but
the
lords
of
minas
tirith
still
fight
on
defying
our
enemies
keeping
the
passage
of
the
river
from
argonath
to
the
sea
and
now
that
part
of
the
tale
that
I
shall
tell
is
drawn
to
its
close
for
in
the
days
of
isildur
the
ruling
ring
passed
out
of
all
knowledge
and
the
three
were
released
from
its
dominion
but
now
in
this
latter
day
they
are
in
peril
once
more
for
to
our
sorrow
the
one
has
been
found
others
shall
speak
of
its
finding
for
in
that
I
played
small
part'

he
ceased
but
at
once
boromir
stood
up
tall
and
proud
before
them
give
me
leave
master
elrond
said
he
first
to
say
more
of
gondor
for
verily
from
the
land
of
gondor
I
am
come
and
it
would
be
well
for
all
to
know
what
passes
there
for
few
I
deem
know
of
our
deeds
and
therefore
guess
little
of
their
peril
if
we
should
fail
at
last

believe
not
that
in
the
land
of
gondor
the
blood
of
nmenor
is
spent
nor
all
its
pride
and
dignity
forgotten
by
our
valour
the
wild
folk
of
the
east
are
still
restrained
and
the
terror
of
morgul
kept
at
bay
and
thus
alone
are
peace
and
freedom
maintained
in
the
lands
behind
us
bulwark
of
the
west
but
if
the
passages
of
the
river
should
be
won
what
then

yet
that
hour
maybe
is
not
now
far
away
the
nameless
enemy
has
arisen
again
smoke
rises
once
more
from
orodruin
that
we
call
mount
doom
the
power
of
the
black
land
grows
and
we
are
hard
beset
when
the
enemy
returned
our
folk
were
driven
from
ithilien
our
fair
domain
east
of
the
river
though
we
kept
a
foothold
there
and
strength
of
arms
but
this
very
year
in
the
days
of
june
sudden
war
came
upon
us
out
of
mordor
and
we
were
swept
away
we
were
outnumbered
for
mordor
has
allied
itself
with
the
easterlings
and
the
cruel
haradrim
but
it
was
not
by
numbers
that
we
were
defeated
a
power
was
there
that
we
have
not
felt
before


some
said
that
it
could
be
seen
like
a
great
black
horseman
a
dark
shadow
under
the
moon
wherever
he
came
a
madness
filled
our
foes
but
fear
fell
on
our
boldest
so
that
horse
and
man
gave
way
and
fled
only
a
remnant
of
our
eastern
force
came
back
destroying
the
last
bridge
that
still
stood
amid
the
ruins
of
osgiliath

'i
was
in
the
company
that
held
the
bridge
until
it
was
cast
down
behind
us
four
only
were
saved
by
swimming
my
brother
and
myself
and
two
others
but
still
we
fight
on
holding
all
the
west
shores
of
anduin
and
those
who
shelter
behind
us
give
us
praise
if
ever
they
hear
our
name
much
praise
but
little
help
only
from
rohan
now
will
any
men
ride
to
us
when
we
call

in
this
evil
hour
I
have
come
on
an
errand
over
many
dangerous
leagues
to
elrond
a
hundred
and
ten
days
I
have
journeyed
all
alone
but
I
do
not
seek
allies
in
war
the
might
of
elrond
is
in
wisdom
not
in
weapons
it
is
said
I
come
to
ask
for
counsel
and
the
unravelling
of
hard
words
for
on
the
eve
of
the
sudden
assault
a
dream
came
to
my
brother
in
a
troubled
sleep
and
afterwards
a
like
dream
came
oft
to
him
again
and
once
to
me

'in
that
dream
I
thought
the
eastern
sky
grew
dark
and
there
was
a
growing
thunder
but
in
the
west
a
pale
light
lingered
and
out
of
it
I
heard
a
voice
remote
but
clear
crying

seek
for
the
sword
that
was
broken

in
imladris
it
dwells

there
shall
be
counsels
taken

stronger
than
morgulspells

there
shall
be
shown
a
token

that
doom
is
near
at
hand

for
isildur's
bane
shall
waken

and
the
halfling
forth
shall
stand

of
these
words
we
could
understand
little
and
we
spoke
to
our
father
denethor
lord
of
minas
tirith
wise
in
the
lore
of
gondor
this
only
would
he
say
that
imladris
was
of
old
the
name
among
the
elves
of
a
far
northern
dale
where
elrond
the
halfelven
dwelt
greatest
of
loremasters
therefore
my
brother
seeing
how
desperate
was
our
need
was
eager
to
heed
the
dream
and
seek
for
imladris
but
since
the
way
was
full
of
doubt
and
danger
I
took
the
journey
upon
myself
loth
was
my
father
to
give
me
leave
and
long
have
I
wandered
by
roads
forgotten
seeking
the
house
of
elrond
of
which
many
had
heard
but
few
knew
where
it
lay'

'and
here
in
the
house
of
elrond
more
shall
be
made
clear
to
you'
said
aragorn
standing
up
he
cast
his
sword
upon
the
table
that
stood
before
elrond
and
the
blade
was
in
two
pieces
here
is
the
sword
that
was
broken'
he
said

and
who
are
you
and
what
have
you
to
do
with
minas
tirith'
asked
boromir
looking
in
wonder
at
the
lean
face
of
the
ranger
and
his
weatherstained
cloak

he
is
aragorn
son
of
arathorn'
said
elrond
and
he
is
descended
through
many
fathers
from
isildur
elendil's
son
of
minas
ithil
he
is
the
chief
of
the
dnedain
in
the
north
and
few
are
now
left
of
that
folk'

then
it
belongs
to
you
and
not
to
me
at
all'
cried
frodo
in
amazement
springing
to
his
feet
as
if
he
expected
the
ring
to
be
demanded
at
once

'it
does
not
belong
to
either
of
us'
said
aragorn
but
it
has
been
ordained
that
you
should
hold
it
for
a
while'

'bring
out
the
ring
frodo'
said
gandalf
solemnly
the
time
has
come
hold
it
up
and
then
boromir
will
understand
the
remainder
of
his
riddle'

there
was
a
hush
and
all
turned
their
eyes
on
frodo
he
was
shaken
by
a
sudden
shame
and
fear
and
he
felt
a
great
reluctance
to
reveal
the
ring
and
a
loathing
of
its
touch
he
wished
he
was
far
away
the
ring
gleamed
and
flickered
as
he
held
it
up
before
them
in
his
trembling
hand

'behold
isildur's
bane'
said
elrond


boromir's
eyes
glinted
as
he
gazed
at
the
golden
thing
the
halfling'
he
muttered
is
then
the
doom
of
minas
tirith
come
at
last
but
why
then
should
we
seek
a
broken
sword'

'the
words
were
not

the
doom
of
minas
tirith
'
said
aragorn
but
doom
and
great
deeds
are
indeed
at
hand
for
the
sword
that
was
broken
is
the
sword
of
elendil
that
broke
beneath
him
when
he
fell
it
has
been
treasured
by
his
heirs
when
all
other
heirlooms
were
lost
for
it
was
spoken
of
old
among
us
that
it
should
be
made
again
when
the
ring
isildur's
bane
was
found
now
you
have
seen
the
sword
that
you
have
sought
what
would
you
ask
do
you
wish
for
the
house
of
elendil
to
return
to
the
land
of
gondor'

I
was
not
sent
to
beg
any
boon
but
to
seek
only
the
meaning
of
a
riddle'
answered
boromir
proudly
yet
we
are
hard
pressed
and
the
sword
of
elendil
would
be
a
help
beyond
our
hopeif
such
a
thing
could
indeed
return
out
of
the
shadows
of
the
past'
he
looked
again
at
aragorn
and
doubt
was
in
his
eyes

frodo
felt
bilbo
stir
impatiently
at
his
side
evidently
he
was
annoyed
on
his
friend's
behalf
standing
suddenly
up
he
burst
out

all
that
is
gold
does
not
glitter

not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost

the
old
that
is
strong
does
not
wither

deep
roots
are
not
reached
by
the
frost


from
the
ashes
a
fire
shall
be
woken

a
light
from
the
shadows
shall
spring

renewed
shall
be
blade
that
was
broken

the
crownless
again
shall
be
king



not
very
good
perhaps
but
to
the
point

if
you
need
more
beyond
the
word
of
elrond
if
that
was
worth
a
journey
of
a
hundred
and
ten
days
to
hear
you
had
best
listen
to
it'
he
sat
down
with
a
snort

I
made
that
up
myself'
he
whispered
to
frodo
for
the
dnadan
a
long
time
ago
when
he
first
told
me
about
himself
I
almost
wish
that
my
adventures
were
not
over
and
that
I
could
go
with
him
when
his
day
comes'

aragorn
smiled
at
him
then
he
turned
to
boromir
again
for
my
part
I
forgive
your
doubt'
he
said
'little
do
I
resemble
the
figures
of
elendil
and
isildur
as
they
stand
carven
in
their
majesty
in
the
halls
of
denethor
I
am
but
the
heir
of
isildur
not
isildur
himself
I
have
had
a
hard
life
and
a
long
and
the
leagues
that
lie
between
here
and
gondor
are
a
small
part
in
the
count
of
my
journeys
I
have
crossed
many
mountains
and
many
rivers
and
trodden
many
plains
even
into
the
far
countries
of
rhn
and
harad
where
the
stars
are
strange

'but
my
home
such
as
I
have
is
in
the
north
for
here
the
heirs
of
valandil
have
ever
dwelt
in
long
line
unbroken
from
father
unto
son
for
many
generations
our
days
have
darkened
and
we
have
dwindled
but
ever
the
sword
has
passed
to
a
new
keeper
and
this
I
will
say
to
you
boromir
ere
I
end
lonely
men
are
we
rangers
of
the
wild
hunters

but
hunters
ever
of
the
servants
of
the
enemy
for
they
are
found
in
many
places
not
in
mordor
only

if
gondor
boromir
has
been
a
stalwart
tower
we
have
played
another
part
many
evil
things
there
are
that
your
strong
walls
and
bright
swords
do
not
stay
you
know
little
of
the
lands
beyond
your
bounds
peace
and
freedom
do
you
say
the
north
would
have
known
them
little
but
for
us
fear
would
have
destroyed
them
but
when
dark
things
come
from
the
houseless
hills
or
creep
from
sunless
woods
they
fly
from
us
what
roads
would
any
dare
to
tread
what
safety
would
there
be
in
quiet
lands
or
in
the
homes
of
simple
men
at
night
if
the
dnedain
were
asleep
or
were
all
gone
into
the
grave


and
yet
less
thanks
have
we
than
you
travellers
scowl
at
us
and
countrymen
give
us
scornful
names
strider
I
am
to
one
fat
man
who
lives
within
a
day's
march
of
foes
that
would
freeze
his
heart
or
lay
his
little
town
in
ruin
if
he
were
not
guarded
ceaselessly
yet
we
would
not
have
it
otherwise
if
simple
folk
are
free
from
care
and
fear
simple
they
will
be
and
we
must
be
secret
to
keep
them
so
that
has
been
the
task
of
my
kindred
while
the
years
have
lengthened
and
the
grass
has
grown

but
now
the
world
is
changing
once
again
a
new
hour
comes
isildur's
bane
is
found
battle
is
at
hand
the
sword
shall
be
reforged
I
will
come
to
minas
tirith'

isildur's
bane
is
found
you
say'
said
boromir
I
have
seen
a
bright
ring
in
the
halfling's
hand
but
isildur
perished
ere
this
age
of
the
world
began
they
say
how
do
the
wise
know
that
this
ring
is
his
and
how
has
it
passed
down
the
years
until
it
is
brought
hither
by
so
strange
a
messenger'

that
shall
be
told'
said
elrond

but
not
yet
I
beg
master'
said
bilbo
already
the
sun
is
climbing
to
noon
and
I
feel
the
need
of
something
to
strengthen
me'

I
had
not
named
you'
said
elrond
smiling
but
I
do
so
now
come
tell
us
your
tale
and
if
you
have
not
yet
cast
your
story
into
verse
you
may
tell
it
in
plain
words
the
briefer
the
sooner
shall
you
be
refreshed'

very
well'
said
bilbo
I
will
do
as
you
bid
but
I
will
now
tell
the
true
story
and
if
some
here
have
heard
me
tell
it
otherwise'

he
looked
sidelong
at
glin

I
ask
them
to
forget
it
and
forgive
me
I
only
wished
to
claim
the
treasure
as
my
very
own
in
those
days
and
to
be
rid
of
the
name
of
thief
that
was
put
on
me
but
perhaps
I
understand
things
a
little
better
now
anyway
this
is
what
happened'

to
some
there
bilbo's
tale
was
wholly
new
and
they
listened
with
amazement
while
the
old
hobbit
actually
not
at
all
displeased
recounted
his
adventure
with
gollum
at
full
length
he
did
not
omit
a
single
riddle
he
would
have
given
also
an
account
of
his
party
and
disappearance
from
the
shire
if
he
had
been
allowed
but
elrond
raised
his
hand

'well
told
my
friend'
he
said
but
that
is
enough
at
this
time
for
the
moment
it
suffices
to
know
that
the
ring
passed
to
frodo
your
heir
let
him
now
speak'

then
less
willingly
than
bilbo
frodo
told
of
all
his
dealings
with
the
ring
from
the
day
that
it
passed
into
his
keeping
every
step
of
his
journey
from
hobbiton
to
the
ford
of
bruinen
was
questioned
and
considered
and
everything
that
he
could
recall
concerning
the
black
riders
was
examined
at
last
he
sat
down
again

not
bad'
bilbo
said
to
him
you
would
have
made
a
good
story
of
it
if
they
hadn't
kept
on
interrupting
I
tried
to
make
a
few
notes
but
we
shall
have
to
go
over
it
all
again
together
some
time
if
I
am
to
write
it
up
there
are
whole
chapters
of
stuff
before
you
ever
got
here'

yes
it
made
quite
a
long
tale'
answered
frodo
'but
the
story
still
does
not
seem
complete
to
me
I
still
want
to
know
a
good
deal
especially
about
gandalf'

galdor
of
the
havens
who
sat
near
by
overheard
him
you
speak
for
me
also'
he
cried
and
turning
to
elrond
he
said
the
wise
may
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
the
halfling's
trove
is
indeed
the
great
ring
of
long
debate
unlikely
though
that
may
seem
to
those
who
know
less
but
may
we
not
hear
the
proofs
and
I
would
ask
this
also
what
of
saruman
he
is
learned
in
the
lore
of
the
rings
yet
he
is
not
among
us
what
is
his
counselif
he
knows
the
things
that
we
have
heard'

the
questions
that
you
ask
galdor
are
bound
together'
said
elrond
I
had
not
overlooked
them
and
they
shall
be
answered
but
these
things
it
is
the
part
of
gandalf
to
make
clear
and
I
call
upon
him
last
for
it
is
the
place
of
honour
and
in
all
this
matter
he
has
been
the
chief'

some
galdor'
said
gandalf
would
think
the
tidings
of
glin
and
the
pursuit
of
frodo
proof
enough
that
the
halfling's
trove
is
a
thing
of
great
worth
to
the
enemy
yet
it
is
a
ring
what
then
the
nine
the
nazgl
keep
the
seven
are
taken
or
destroyed'
at
this
glin
stirred
but
did
not
speak
the
three
we
know
of
what
then
is
this
one
that
he
desires
so
much


'there
is
indeed
a
wide
waste
of
time
between
the
river
and
the
mountain
between
the
loss
and
the
finding
but
the
gap
in
the
knowledge
of
the
wise
has
been
filled
at
last
yet
too
slowly
for
the
enemy
has
been
close
behind
closer
even
than
I
feared
and
well
is
it
that
not
until
this
year
this
very
summer
as
it
seems
did
he
learn
the
full
truth

'some
here
will
remember
that
many
years
ago
I
myself
dared
to
pass
the
doors
of
the
necromancer
in
dol
guldur
and
secretly
explored
his
ways
and
found
thus
that
our
fears
were
true
he
was
none
other
than
sauron
our
enemy
of
old
at
length
taking
shape
and
power
again
some
too
will
remember
also
that
saruman
dissuaded
us
from
open
deeds
against
him
and
for
long
we
watched
him
only
yet
at
last
as
his
shadow
grew
saruman
yielded
and
the
council
put
forth
its
strength
and
drove
the
evil
out
of
mirkwood
and
that
was
in
the
very
year
of
the
finding
of
this
ring
a
strange
chance
if
chance
it
was

but
we
were
too
late
as
elrond
foresaw
sauron
also
had
watched
us
and
had
long
prepared
against
our
stroke
governing
mordor
from
afar
through
minas
morgul
where
his
nine
servants
dwelt
until
all
was
ready
then
he
gave
way
before
us
but
only
feigned
to
flee
and
soon
after
came
to
the
dark
tower
and
openly
declared
himself
then
for
the
last
time
the
council
met
for
now
we
learned
that
he
was
seeking
ever
more
eagerly
for
the
one
we
feared
then
that
he
had
some
news
of
it
that
we
knew
nothing
of
but
saruman
said
nay
and
repeated
what
he
had
said
to
us
before
that
the
one
would
never
again
be
found
in
middleearth


at
the
worst
said
he
our
enemy
knows
that
we
have
it
not
and
that
it
still
is
lost
but
what
was
lost
may
yet
be
found
he
thinks
fear
not
his
hope
will
cheat
him
have
I
not
earnestly
studied
this
matter
into
anduin
the
great
it
fell
and
long
ago
while
sauron
slept
it
was
rolled
down
the
river
to
the
sea
there
let
it
lie
until
the
end'

gandalf
fell
silent
gazing
eastward
from
the
porch
to
the
far
peaks
of
the
misty
mountains
at
whose
great
roots
the
peril
of
the
world
had
so
long
lain
hidden
he
sighed

there
I
was
at
fault'
he
said
I
was
lulled
by
the
words
of
saruman
the
wise
but
I
should
have
sought
for
the
truth
sooner
and
our
peril
would
now
be
less'

we
were
all
at
fault'
said
elrond
and
but
for
your
vigilance
the
darkness
maybe
would
already
be
upon
us
but
say
on'

from
the
first
my
heart
misgave
me
against
all
reason
that
I
knew'
said
gandalf
and
I
desired
to
know
how
this
thing
came
to
gollum
and
how
long
he
had
possessed
it
so
I
set
a
watch
for
him
guessing
that
he
would
ere
long
come
forth
from
his
darkness
to
seek
for
his
treasure
he
came
but
he
escaped
and
was
not
found
and
then
alas
I
let
the
matter
rest
watching
and
waiting
only
as
we
have
too
often
done

time
passed
with
many
cares
until
my
doubts
were
awakened
again
to
sudden
fear
whence
came
the
hobbit's
ring
what
if
my
fear
was
true
should
be
done
with
it
those
things
I
must
decide
but
I
spoke
yet
of
my
dread
to
none
knowing
the
peril
of
an
untimely
whisper
if
it
went
astray
in
all
the
long
wars
with
the
dark
tower
treason
has
ever
been
our
greatest
foe

'that
was
seventeen
years
ago
soon
I
became
aware
that
spies
of
many
sorts
even
beasts
and
birds
were
gathered
round
the
shire
and
my
fear
grew
I
called
for
the
help
of
the
dnedain
and
their
watch
was
doubled
and
I
opened
my
heart
to
aragorn
the
heir
of
isildur'

and
i'
said
aragorn
counselled
that
we
should
hunt
for
gollum
too
late
though
it
may
seem
and
since
it
seemed
fit
that
isildur's
heir
should
labour
to
repair
isildur's
fault
I
went
with
gandalf
on
the
long
and
hopeless
search'

then
gandalf
told
how
they
had
explored
the
whole
length
of
wilderland
down
even
to
the
mountains
of
shadow
and
the
fences
of
mordor
there
we
had
rumour
of
him
and
we
guess
that
he
dwelt
there
long
in
the
dark
hills
but
we
never
found
him
and
at
last
I
despaired
and
then
in
my
despair
I
thought
again
of
a
test
that
might
make
the
finding
of
gollum
unneeded
the
ring
itself
might
tell
if
it
were
the
one
the
memory
of
words
at
the
council
came
back
to
me
words
of
saruman
halfheeded
at
the
time
I
heard
them
now
clearly
in
my
heart



the
nine
the
seven
and
the
three
he
said
had
each
their
proper
gem
not
so
the
one
it
was
round
and
unadorned
as
it
were
one
of
the
lesser
rings
but
its
maker
set
marks
upon
it
that
the
skilled
maybe
could
still
see
and
read

what
those
marks
were
he
had
not
said
who
now
would
know
the
maker
and
saruman
but
great
though
his
lore
may
be
it
must
have
a
source
what
hand
save
sauron's
ever
held
this
thing
ere
it
was
lost
the
hand
of
isildur
alone

with
that
thought
I
forsook
the
chase
and
passed
swiftly
to
gondor
in
former
days
the
members
of
my
order
had
been
well
received
there
but
saruman
most
of
all
often
he
had
been
for
long
the
guest
of
the
lords
of
the
city
less
welcome
did
the
lord
denethor
show
me
then
than
of
old
and
grudgingly
he
permitted
me
to
search
among
his
hoarded
scrolls
and
books

'
if
indeed
you
look
only
as
you
say
for
records
of
ancient
days
and
the
beginnings
of
the
city
read
on

he
said
for
to
me
what
was
is
less
dark
than
what
is
to
come
and
that
is
my
care
but
unless
you
have
more
skill
even
than
saruman
who
has
studied
here
long
you
will
find
naught
that
is
not
well
known
to
me
who
am
master
of
the
lore
of
this
city

so
said
denethor
and
yet
there
lie
in
his
hoards
many
records
that
few
now
can
read
even
of
the
loremasters
for
their
scripts
and
tongues
have
become
dark
to
later
men
and
boromir
there
lies
in
minas
tirith
still
unread
I
guess
by
any
save
saruman
and
myself
since
the
kings
failed
a
scroll
that
isildur
made
himself
for
isildur
did
not
march
away
straight
from
the
war
in
mordor
as
some
have
told
the
tale'

'some
in
the
north
maybe'
boromir
broke
in
'all
know
in
gondor
that
he
went
first
to
minas
anor
and
dwelt
a
while
with
his
nephew
meneldil
instructing
him
before
he
committed
to
him
the
rule
of
the
south
kingdom
in
that
time
he
planted
there
the
last
sapling
of
the
white
tree
in
memory
of
his
brother'

but
in
that
time
also
he
made
this
scroll'
said
gandalf
and
that
is
not
remembered
in
gondor
it
would
seem
for
this
scroll
concerns
the
ring
and
thus
wrote
isildur
therein


the
great
ring
shall
go
now
to
be
an
heirloom
of
the
north
kingdom
but
records
of
it
shall
be
left
in
gondor
where
also
dwell
the
heirs
of
elendil
lest
a
time
come
when
the
memory
of
these
great
matters
shall
grow
dim


and
after
these
words
isildur
described
the
ring
such
as
he
found
it


it
was
hot
when
I
first
took
it
hot
as
a
glede
and
my
hand
was
scorched
so
that
I
doubt
if
ever
again
I
shall
be
free
of
the
pain
of
it
yet
even
as
I
write
it
is
cooled
and
it
seemeth
to
shrink
though
it
loseth
neither
its
beauty
nor
its
shape
already
the
writing
upon
it
which
at
first
was
as
clear
as
red
flame
fadeth
and
is
now
only
barely
to
be
read
it
is
fashioned
in
an
elvenscript
of
eregion
for
they
have
no
letters
in
mordor
for
such
subtle
work
but
the
language
is
unknown
to
me
I
deem
it
to
be
a
tongue
of
the
black
land
since
it
is
foul
and
uncouth
what
evil
it
saith
I
do
not
know
but
I
trace
here
a
copy
of
it
lest
it
fade
beyond
recall
the
ring
misseth
maybe
the
heat
of
sauron's
hand
which
was
black
and
yet
burned
like
fire
and
so
gilgalad
was
destroyed
and
maybe
were
the
gold
made
hot
again
the
writing
would
be
refreshed
but
for
my
part
I
will
risk
no
hurt
to
this
thing
of
all
the
works
of
sauron
the
only
fair
it
is
precious
to
me
though
I
buy
it
with
great
pain


'when
I
read
these
words
my
quest
was
ended
for
the
traced
writing
was
indeed
as
isildur
guessed
in
the
tongue
of
mordor
and
the
servants
of
the
tower
and
what
was
said
therein
was
already
known
for
in
the
day
that
sauron
first
put
on
the
one
celebrimbor
maker
of
the
three
was
aware
of
him
and
from
afar
he
heard
him
speak
these
words
and
so
his
evil
purposes
were
revealed

at
once
I
took
my
leave
of
denethor
but
even
as
I
went
northwards
messages
came
to
me
out
of
lrien
that
aragorn
had
passed
that
way
and
that
he
had
found
the
creature
called
gollum
therefore
I
went
first
to
meet
him
and
hear
his
tale
into
what
deadly
perils
he
had
gone
alone
I
dared
not
guess'

there
is
little
need
to
tell
of
them'
said
aragorn
if
a
man
must
needs
walk
in
sight
of
the
black
gate
or
tread
the
deadly
flowers
of
morgul
vale
then
perils
he
will
have
I
too
despaired
at
last
and
I
began
my
homeward
journey
and
then
by
fortune
I
came
suddenly
on
what
I
sought
the
marks
of
soft
feet
beside
a
muddy
pool
but
now
the
trail
was
fresh
and
swift
and
it
led
not
to
mordor
but
away
along
the
skirts
of
the
dead
marshes
I
followed
it
and
then
I
had
him
lurking
by
a
stagnant
mere
peering
in
the
water
as
the
dark
eve
fell
I
caught
him
gollum
he
was
covered
with
green
slime
he
will
never
love
me
I
fear
for
he
bit
me
and
I
was
not
gentle
nothing
more
did
I
ever
get
from
his
mouth
than
the
marks
of
his
teeth
I
deemed
it
the
worst
part
of
all
my
journey
the
road
back
watching
him
day
and
night
making
him
walk
before
me
with
a
halter
on
his
neck
gagged
until
he
was
tamed
by
lack
of
drink
and
food
driving
him
ever
towards
mirkwood
I
brought
him
there
at
last
and
gave
him
to
the
elves
for
we
had
agreed
that
this
should
be
done
and
I
was
glad
to
be
rid
of
his
company
for
he
stank
for
my
part
I
hope
never
to
look
upon
him
again
but
gandalf
came
and
endured
long
speech
with
him'

yes
long
and
weary'
said
gandalf
but
not
without
profit
for
one
thing
the
tale
he
told
of
his
loss
agreed
with
that
which
bilbo
has
now
told
openly
for
the
first
time
but
that
mattered
little
since
I
had
already
guessed
it
but
I
learned
then
first
that
gollum's
ring
came
out
of
the
great
river
nigh
to
the
gladden
fields
and
I
learned
also
that
he
had
possessed
it
long
many
lives
of
his
small
kind
the
power
of
the
ring
had
lengthened
his
years
far
beyond
their
span
but
that
power
only
the
great
rings
wield

and
if
that
is
not
proof
enough
galdor
there
is
the
other
test
that
I
spoke
of
upon
this
very
ring
which
you
have
here
seen
held
aloft
round
and
unadorned
the
letters
that
isildur
reported
may
still
be
read
if
one
has
the
strength
of
will
to
set
the
golden
thing
in
the
fire
a
while
that
I
have
done
and
this
I
have
read


ash
nazg
durbatulk
ash
nazg
gimbatul
ash
nazg
thrakatulk
agh
burzumishi
krimpatul'


the
change
in
the
wizard's
voice
was
astounding
suddenly
it
became
menacing
powerful
harsh
as
stone
a
shadow
seemed
to
pass
over
the
high
sun
and
the
porch
for
a
moment
grew
dark
all
trembled
and
the
elves
stopped
their
ears

never
before
has
any
voice
dared
to
utter
the
words
of
that
tongue
in
imladris
gandalf
the
grey'
said
elrond
as
the
shadow
passed
and
the
company
breathed
once
more

and
let
us
hope
that
none
will
ever
speak
it
here
again'
answered
gandalf
nonetheless
I
do
not
ask
your
pardon
master
elrond
for
if
that
tongue
is
not
soon
to
be
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
west
then
let
all
put
doubt
aside
that
this
thing
is
indeed
what
the
wise
have
declared
the
treasure
of
the
enemy
fraught
with
all
his
malice
and
in
it
lies
a
great
part
of
his
strength
of
old
out
of
the
black
years
come
the
words
that
the
smiths
of
eregion
heard
and
knew
that
they
had
been
betrayed


one
ring
to
rule
them
all
one
ring
to
find
them
one
ring
to
bring
them
all
and
in
the
darkness
bind
them



know
also
my
friends
that
I
learned
more
yet
from
gollum
he
was
loth
to
speak
and
his
tale
was
unclear
but
it
is
beyond
all
doubt
that
he
went
to
mordor
and
there
all
that
he
knew
was
forced
from
him
thus
the
enemy
knows
now
that
the
one
is
found
that
it
was
long
in
the
shire
and
since
his
servants
have
pursued
it
almost
to
our
door
he
soon
will
know
already
he
may
know
even
as
I
speak
that
we
have
it
here'

all
sat
silent
for
a
while
until
at
length
boromir
spoke
he
is
a
small
thing
you
say
this
gollum
small
but
great
in
mischief
what
became
of
him
to
what
doom
did
you
put
him'

'he
is
in
prison
but
no
worse'
said
aragorn
he
had
suffered
much
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
tormented
and
the
fear
of
sauron
lies
black
on
his
heart
still
I
for
one
am
glad
that
he
is
safely
kept
by
the
watchful
elves
of
mirkwood
his
malice
is
great
and
gives
him
a
strength
hardly
to
be
believed
in
one
so
lean
and
withered
he
could
work
much
mischief
still
if
he
were
free
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
was
allowed
to
leave
mordor
on
some
evil
errand'

alas
alas'
cried
legolas
and
in
his
fair
elvish
face
there
was
great
distress
the
tidings
that
I
was
sent
to
bring
must
now
be
told
they
are
not
good
but
only
here
have
I
learned
how
evil
they
may
seem
to
this
company
smagol
who
is
now
called
gollum
has
escaped'

'escaped'
cried
aragorn
'that
is
ill
news
indeed
we
shall
all
rue
it
bitterly
I
fear
how
came
the
folk
of
thranduil
to
fail
in
their
trust'

not
through
lack
of
watchfulness'
said
legolas
but
perhaps
through
overkindliness
and
we
fear
that
the
prisoner
had
aid
from
others
and
that
more
is
known
of
our
doings
than
we
could
wish
we
guarded
this
creature
day
and
night
at
gandalf's
bidding
much
though
we
wearied
of
the
task
but
gandalf
bade
us
hope
still
for
his
cure
and
we
had
not
the
heart
to
keep
him
ever
in
dungeons
under
the
earth
where
he
would
fall
back
into
his
old
black
thoughts'

'you
were
less
tender
to
me'
said
glin
with
a
flash
of
his
eyes
as
old
memories
were
stirred
of
his
imprisonment
in
the
deep
places
of
the
elvenking's
halls

'now
come'
said
gandalf
pray
do
not
interrupt
my
good
glin
that
was
a
regrettable
misunderstanding
long
set
right
if
all
the
grievances
that
stand
between
elves
and
dwarves
are
to
be
brought
up
here
we
may
as
well
abandon
this
council'

glin
rose
and
bowed
and
legolas
continued
'in
the
days
of
fair
weather
we
led
gollum
through
the
woods
and
there
was
a
high
tree
standing
alone
far
from
the
others
which
he
liked
to
climb
often
we
let
him
mount
up
to
the
highest
branches
until
he
felt
the
free
wind
but
we
set
a
guard
at
the
tree's
foot
one
day
he
refused
to
come
down
and
the
guards
had
no
mind
to
climb
after
him
he
had
learned
the
trick
of
clinging
to
boughs
with
his
feet
as
well
as
with
his
hands
so
they
sat
by
the
tree
far
into
the
night

'it
was
that
very
night
of
summer
yet
moonless
and
starless
that
orcs
came
on
us
at
unawares
we
drove
them
off
after
some
time
they
were
many
and
fierce
but
they
came
from
over
the
mountains
and
were
unused
to
the
woods
when
the
battle
was
over
we
found
that
gollum
was
gone
and
his
guards
were
slain
or
taken
it
then
seemed
plain
to
us
that
the
attack
had
been
made
for
his
rescue
and
that
he
knew
of
it
beforehand
how
that
was
contrived
we
cannot
guess
but
gollum
is
cunning
and
the
spies
of
the
enemy
are
many
the
dark
things
that
were
driven
out
in
the
year
of
the
dragon's
fall
have
returned
in
greater
numbers
and
mirkwood
is
again
an
evil
place
save
where
our
realm
is
maintained

we
have
failed
to
recapture
gollum
we
came
on
his
trail
among
those
of
many
orcs
and
it
plunged
deep
into
the
forest
going
south
but
ere
long
it
escaped
our
skill
and
we
dared
not
continue
the
hunt
for
we
were
drawing
nigh
to
dol
guldur
and
that
is
still
a
very
evil
place
we
do
not
go
that
way'

well
well
he
is
gone'
said
gandalf
'we
have
no
time
to
seek
for
him
again
he
must
do
what
he
will
but
he
may
play
a
part
yet
that
neither
he
nor
sauron
have
foreseen


'and
now
I
will
answer
galdor's
other
questions
what
of
saruman
what
are
his
counsels
to
us
in
this
need
this
tale
I
must
tell
in
full
for
only
elrond
has
heard
it
yet
and
that
in
brief
but
it
will
bear
on
all
that
we
must
resolve
it
is
the
last
chapter
in
the
tale
of
the
ring
so
far
as
it
has
yet
gone

'at
the
end
of
june
I
was
in
the
shire
but
a
cloud
of
anxiety
was
on
my
mind
and
I
rode
to
the
southern
borders
of
the
little
land
for
I
had
a
foreboding
of
some
danger
still
hidden
from
me
but
drawing
near
there
messages
reached
me
telling
me
of
war
and
defeat
in
gondor
and
when
I
heard
of
the
black
shadow
a
chill
smote
my
heart
but
I
found
nothing
save
a
few
fugitives
from
the
south
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
on
them
sat
a
fear
of
which
they
would
not
speak
I
turned
then
east
and
north
and
journeyed
along
the
greenway
and
not
far
from
bree
I
came
upon
a
traveller
sitting
on
a
bank
beside
the
road
with
his
grazing
horse
beside
him
it
was
radagast
the
brown
who
at
one
time
dwelt
at
rhosgobel
near
the
borders
of
mirkwood
he
is
one
of
my
order
but
I
had
not
seen
him
for
many
a
year


gandalf

he
cried
I
was
seeking
you
but
I
am
a
stranger
in
these
parts
all
I
knew
was
that
you
might
be
found
in
a
wild
region
with
the
uncouth
name
of
shire

'
your
information
was
correct
I
said
but
do
not
put
it
that
way
if
you
meet
any
of
the
inhabitants
you
are
near
the
borders
of
the
shire
now
and
what
do
you
want
with
me
it
must
be
pressing
you
were
never
a
traveller
unless
driven
by
great
need

'
I
have
an
urgent
errand
he
said
my
news
is
evil
then
he
looked
about
him
as
if
the
hedges
might
have
ears
nazgl
he
whispered
the
nine
are
abroad
again
they
have
crossed
the
river
secretly
and
are
moving
westward
they
have
taken
the
guise
of
riders
in
black

'i
knew
then
what
I
had
dreaded
without
knowing
it


the
enemy
must
have
some
great
need
or
purpose
said
radagast
but
what
it
is
that
makes
him
look
to
these
distant
and
desolate
parts
I
cannot
guess


what
do
you
mean

said
I


I
have
been
told
that
wherever
they
go
the
riders
ask
for
news
of
a
land
called
shire

'

the

shire
I
said
but
my
heart
sank
for
even
the
wise
might
fear
to
withstand
the
nine
when
they
are
gathered
together
under
their
fell
chieftain
a
great
king
and
sorcerer
he
was
of
old
and
now
he
wields
a
deadly
fear
who
told
you
and
who
sent
you

I
asked

'
saruman
the
white
answered
radagast
and
he
told
me
to
say
that
if
you
feel
the
need
he
will
help
but
you
must
seek
his
aid
at
once
or
it
will
be
too
late

'and
that
message
brought
me
hope
for
saruman
the
white
is
the
greatest
of
my
order
radagast
is
of
course
a
worthy
wizard
a
master
of
shapes
and
changes
of
hue
and
he
has
much
lore
of
herbs
and
beasts
and
birds
are
especially
his
friends
but
saruman
has
long
studied
the
arts
of
the
enemy
himself
and
thus
we
have
often
been
able
to
forestall
him
it
was
by
the
devices
of
saruman
that
we
drove
him
from
dol
guldur
it
might
be
that
he
had
found
some
weapons
that
would
drive
back
the
nine

'
I
will
go
to
saruman
I
said

'
then
you
must
go

now

said
radagast
for
I
have
wasted
time
in
looking
for
you
and
the
days
are
running
short
I
was
told
to
find
you
before
midsummer
and
that
is
now
here
even
if
you
set
out
from
this
spot
you
will
hardly
reach
him
before
the
nine
discover
the
land
that
they
seek
I
myself
shall
turn
back
at
once
and
with
that
he
mounted
and
would
have
ridden
straight
off


stay
a
moment

I
said
we
shall
need
your
help
and
the
help
of
all
things
that
will
give
it
send
out
messages
to
all
the
beasts
and
birds
that
are
your
friends
tell
them
to
bring
news
of
anything
that
bears
on
this
matter
to
saruman
and
gandalf
let
messages
be
sent
to
orthanc


I
will
do
that
he
said
and
rode
off
as
if
the
nine
were
after
him


I
could
not
follow
him
then
and
there
I
had
ridden
very
far
already
that
day
and
I
was
as
weary
as
my
horse
and
I
needed
to
consider
matters
I
stayed
the
night
in
bree
and
decided
that
I
had
no
time
to
return
to
the
shire
never
did
I
make
a
greater
mistake

however
I
wrote
a
message
to
frodo
and
trusted
to
my
friend
the
innkeeper
to
send
it
to
him
I
rode
away
at
dawn
and
I
came
at
long
last
to
the
dwelling
of
saruman
that
is
far
south
in
isengard
in
the
end
of
the
misty
mountains
not
far
from
the
gap
of
rohan
and
boromir
will
tell
you
that
that
is
a
great
open
vale
that
lies
between
the
misty
mountains
and
the
northmost
foothills
of
ered
nimrais
the
white
mountains
of
his
home
but
isengard
is
a
circle
of
sheer
rocks
that
enclose
a
valley
as
with
a
wall
and
in
the
midst
of
that
valley
is
a
tower
of
stone
called
orthanc
it
was
not
made
by
saruman
but
by
the
men
of
nmenor
long
ago
and
it
is
very
tall
and
has
many
secrets
yet
it
looks
not
to
be
a
work
of
craft
it
cannot
be
reached
save
by
passing
the
circle
of
isengard
and
in
that
circle
there
is
only
one
gate

'late
one
evening
I
came
to
the
gate
like
a
great
arch
in
the
wall
of
rock
and
it
was
strongly
guarded
but
the
keepers
of
the
gate
were
on
the
watch
for
me
and
told
me
that
saruman
awaited
me
I
rode
under
the
arch
and
the
gate
closed
silently
behind
me
and
suddenly
I
was
afraid
though
I
knew
no
reason
for
it

'but
I
rode
to
the
foot
of
orthanc
and
came
to
the
stair
of
saruman
and
there
he
met
me
and
led
me
up
to
his
high
chamber
he
wore
a
ring
on
his
finger


so
you
have
come
gandalf
he
said
to
me
gravely
but
in
his
eyes
there
seemed
to
be
a
white
light
as
if
a
cold
laughter
was
in
his
heart


yes
I
have
come
I
said
I
have
come
for
your
aid
saruman
the
white
and
that
title
seemed
to
anger
him

'
have
you
indeed
gandalf
the

grey


he
scoffed
for
aid
it
has
seldom
been
heard
of
that
gandalf
the
grey
sought
for
aid
one
so
cunning
and
so
wise
wandering
about
the
lands
and
concerning
himself
in
every
business
whether
it
belongs
to
him
or
not

'i
looked
at
him
and
wondered
but
if
I
am
not
deceived
said
I
things
are
now
moving
which
will
require
the
union
of
all
our
strength

'
that
may
be
so
he
said
but
the
thought
is
late
in
coming
to
you
how
long
I
wonder
have
you
concealed
from
me
the
head
of
the
council
a
matter
of
greatest
import
what
brings
you
now
from
your
lurkingplace
in
the
shire


'
the
nine
have
come
forth
again
I
answered
they
have
crossed
the
river
so
radagast
said
to
me


radagast
the
brown

laughed
saruman
and
he
no
longer
concealed
his
scorn
radagast
the
birdtamer
radagast
the
simple
radagast
the
fool
yet
he
had
just
the
wit
to
play
the
part
that
I
set
him
for
you
have
come
and
that
was
all
the
purpose
of
my
message
and
here
you
will
stay
gandalf
the
grey
and
rest
from
journeys
for
I
am
saruman
the
wise
saruman
ringmaker
saruman
of
many
colours


'i
looked
then
and
saw
that
his
robes
which
had
seemed
white
were
not
so
but
were
woven
of
all
colours
and
if
he
moved
they
shimmered
and
changed
hue
so
that
the
eye
was
bewildered

'
I
liked
white
better
I
said

'
white

he
sneered
it
serves
as
a
beginning
white
cloth
may
be
dyed
the
white
page
can
be
overwritten
and
the
white
light
can
be
broken

'
in
which
case
it
is
no
longer
white
said
I
and
he
that
breaks
a
thing
to
find
out
what
it
is
has
left
the
path
of
wisdom

'
you
need
not
speak
to
me
as
to
one
of
the
fools
that
you
take
for
friends
said
he
I
have
not
brought
you
hither
to
be
instructed
by
you
but
to
give
you
a
choice

'he
drew
himself
up
then
and
began
to
declaim
as
if
he
were
making
a
speech
long
rehearsed
the
elder
days
are
gone
the
middle
days
are
passing
the
younger
days
are
beginning
the
time
of
the
elves
is
over
but
our
time
is
at
hand
the
world
of
men
which
we
must
rule
but
we
must
have
power
power
to
order
all
things
as
we
will
for
that
good
which
only
the
wise
can
see


'
and
listen
gandalf
my
old
friend
and
helper

he
said
coming
near
and
speaking
now
in
a
softer
voice
I
said
we
for
we
it
may
be
if
you
will
join
with
me
a
new
power
is
rising
against
it
the
old
allies
and
policies
will
not
avail
us
at
all
there
is
no
hope
left
in
elves
or
dying
nmenor
this
then
is
one
choice
before
you
before
us
we
may
join
with
that
power
it
would
be
wise
gandalf
there
is
hope
that
way
its
victory
is
at
hand
and
there
will
be
rich
reward
for
those
that
aided
it
as
the
power
grows
its
proved
friends
will
also
grow
and
the
wise
such
as
you
and
I
may
with
patience
come
at
last
to
direct
its
courses
to
control
it
we
can
bide
our
time
we
can
keep
our
thoughts
in
our
hearts
deploring
maybe
evils
done
by
the
way
but
approving
the
high
and
ultimate
purpose
knowledge
rule
order
all
the
things
that
we
have
so
far
striven
in
vain
to
accomplish
hindered
rather
than
helped
by
our
weak
or
idle
friends
there
need
not
be
there
would
not
be
any
real
change
in
our
designs
only
in
our
means

'
saruman
I
said
I
have
heard
speeches
of
this
kind
before
but
only
in
the
mouths
of
emissaries
sent
from
mordor
to
deceive
the
ignorant
I
cannot
think
that
you
brought
me
so
far
only
to
weary
my
ears

'he
looked
at
me
sidelong
and
paused
a
while
considering
well
I
see
that
this
wise
course
does
not
commend
itself
to
you
he
said
not
yet
not
if
some
better
way
can
be
contrived


he
came
and
laid
his
long
hand
on
my
arm
and
why
not
gandalf

he
whispered
why
not
the
ruling
ring
if
we
could
command
that
then
the
power
would
pass
to
us
that
is
in
truth
why
I
brought
you
here
for
I
have
many
eyes
in
my
service
and
I
believe
that
you
know
where
this
precious
thing
now
lies
is
it
not
so
or
why
do
the
nine
ask
for
the
shire
and
what
is
your
business
there

as
he
said
this
a
lust
which
he
could
not
conceal
shone
suddenly
in
his
eyes

'
saruman
I
said
standing
away
from
him
only
one
hand
at
a
time
can
wield
the
one
and
you
know
that
well
so
do
not
trouble
to
say
we
but
I
would
not
give
it
nay
I
would
not
give
even
news
of
it
to
you
now
that
I
learn
your
mind
you
were
head
of
the
council
but
you
have
unmasked
yourself
at
last
well
the
choices
are
it
seems
to
submit
to
sauron
or
to
yourself
I
will
take
neither
have
you
others
to
offer


'he
was
cold
now
and
perilous
yes
he
said
I
did
not
expect
you
to
show
wisdom
even
in
your
own
behalf
but
I
gave
you
the
chance
of
aiding
me
willingly
and
so
saving
yourself
much
trouble
and
pain
the
third
choice
is
to
stay
here
until
the
end

'
until
what
end


'
until
you
reveal
to
me
where
the
one
may
be
found
I
may
find
means
to
persuade
you
or
until
it
is
found
in
your
despite
and
the
ruler
has
time
to
turn
to
lighter
matters
to
devise
say
a
fitting
reward
for
the
hindrance
and
insolence
of
gandalf
the
grey

'
that
may
not
prove
to
be
one
of
the
lighter
matters
said
I
he
laughed
at
me
for
my
words
were
empty
and
he
knew
it

they
took
me
and
they
set
me
alone
on
the
pinnacle
of
orthanc
in
the
place
where
saruman
was
accustomed
to
watch
the
stars
there
is
no
descent
save
by
a
narrow
stair
of
many
thousand
steps
and
the
valley
below
seems
far
away
I
looked
on
it
and
saw
that
whereas
it
had
once
been
green
and
fair
it
was
now
filled
with
pits
and
forges
wolves
and
orcs
were
housed
in
isengard
for
saruman
was
mustering
a
great
force
on
his
own
account
in
rivalry
of
sauron
and
not
in
his
service
yet
over
all
his
works
a
dark
smoke
hung
and
wrapped
itself
about
the
sides
of
orthanc
I
stood
alone
on
an
island
in
the
clouds
and
I
had
no
chance
of
escape
and
my
days
were
bitter
I
was
pierced
with
cold
and
I
had
but
little
room
in
which
to
pace
to
and
fro
brooding
on
the
coming
of
the
riders
to
the
north

that
the
nine
had
indeed
arisen
I
felt
assured
apart
from
the
words
of
saruman
which
might
be
lies
long
ere
I
came
to
isengard
I
had
heard
tidings
by
the
way
that
could
not
be
mistaken
fear
was
ever
in
my
heart
for
my
friends
in
the
shire
but
still
I
had
some
hope
I
hoped
that
frodo
had
set
forth
at
once
as
my
letter
had
urged
and
that
he
had
reached
rivendell
before
the
deadly
pursuit
began
and
both
my
fear
and
my
hope
proved
illfounded
for
my
hope
was
founded
on
a
fat
man
in
bree
and
my
fear
was
founded
on
the
cunning
of
sauron
but
fat
men
who
sell
ale
have
many
calls
to
answer
and
the
power
of
sauron
is
still
less
than
fear
makes
it
but
in
the
circle
of
isengard
trapped
and
alone
it
was
not
easy
to
think
that
the
hunters
before
whom
all
have
fled
or
fallen
would
falter
in
the
shire
far
away'

I
saw
you'
cried
frodo
you
were
walking
backwards
and
forwards
the
moon
shone
in
your
hair'

gandalf
paused
astonished
and
looked
at
him
'it
was
only
a
dream'
said
frodo
but
it
suddenly
came
back
to
me
I
had
quite
forgotten
it
it
came
some
time
ago
after
I
left
the
shire
I
think'

then
it
was
late
in
coming'
said
gandalf
'as
you
will
see
I
was
in
an
evil
plight
and
those
who
know
me
will
agree
that
I
have
seldom
been
in
such
need
and
do
not
bear
such
misfortune
well
gandalf
the
grey
caught
like
a
fly
in
a
spider's
treacherous
web
yet
even
the
most
subtle
spiders
may
leave
a
weak
thread

at
first
I
feared
as
saruman
no
doubt
intended
that
radagast
had
also
fallen
yet
I
had
caught
no
hint
of
anything
wrong
in
his
voice
or
in
his
eye
at
our
meeting
if
I
had
I
should
never
have
gone
to
isengard
or
I
should
have
gone
more
warily
so
saruman
guessed
and
he
had
concealed
his
mind
and
deceived
his
messenger
it
would
have
been
useless
in
any
case
to
try
and
win
over
the
honest
radagast
to
treachery
he
sought
me
in
good
faith
and
so
persuaded
me

that
was
the
undoing
of
saruman's
plot
for
radagast
knew
no
reason
why
he
should
not
do
as
I
asked
and
he
rode
away
towards
mirkwood
where
he
had
many
friends
of
old
and
the
eagles
of
the
mountains
went
far
and
wide
and
they
saw
many
things
the
gathering
of
wolves
and
the
mustering
of
orcs
and
the
nine
riders
going
hither
and
thither
in
the
lands
and
they
heard
news
of
the
escape
of
gollum
and
they
sent
a
messenger
to
bring
these
tidings
to
me

so
it
was
that
when
summer
waned
there
came
a
night
of
moon
and
gwaihir
the
windlord
swiftest
of
the
great
eagles
came
unlookedfor
to
orthanc
and
he
found
me
standing
on
the
pinnacle
then
I
spoke
to
him
and
he
bore
me
away
before
saruman
was
aware
I
was
far
from
isengard
ere
the
wolves
and
orcs
issued
from
the
gate
to
pursue
me


how
far
can
you
bear
me

I
said
to
gwaihir


many
leagues
said
he
but
not
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
I
was
sent
to
bear
tidings
not
burdens


then
I
must
have
a
steed
on
land
I
said
and
a
steed
surpassingly
swift
for
I
have
never
had
such
need
of
haste
before


then
I
will
bear
you
to
edoras
where
the
lord
of
rohan
sits
in
his
halls
he
said
for
that
is
not
very
far
off
and
I
was
glad
for
in
the
riddermark
of
rohan
the
rohirrim
the
horselords
dwell
and
there
are
no
horses
like
those
that
are
bred
in
that
great
vale
between
the
misty
mountains
and
the
white


are
the
men
of
rohan
still
to
be
trusted
do
you
think

I
said
to
gwaihir
for
the
treason
of
saruman
had
shaken
my
faith


they
pay
a
tribute
of
horses
he
answered
and
send
many
yearly
to
mordor
or
so
it
is
said
but
they
are
not
yet
under
the
yoke
but
if
saruman
has
become
evil
as
you
say
then
their
doom
cannot
be
long
delayed

he
set
me
down
in
the
land
of
rohan
ere
dawn
and
now
I
have
lengthened
my
tale
over
long
the
rest
must
be
more
brief
in
rohan
I
found
evil
already
at
work
the
lies
of
saruman
and
the
king
of
the
land
would
not
listen
to
my
warnings
he
bade
me
take
a
horse
and
be
gone
and
I
chose
one
much
to
my
liking
but
little
to
his
I
took
the
best
horse
in
his
land
and
I
have
never
seen
the
like
of
him'

'then
he
must
be
a
noble
beast
indeed'
said
aragorn
'and
it
grieves
me
more
than
many
tidings
that
might
seem
worse
to
learn
that
sauron
levies
such
tribute
it
was
not
so
when
last
I
was
in
that
land'


nor
is
it
now
I
will
swear'
said
boromir
it
is
a
lie
that
comes
from
the
enemy
I
know
the
men
of
rohan
true
and
valiant
our
allies
dwelling
still
in
the
lands
that
we
gave
them
long
ago'

the
shadow
of
mordor
lies
on
distant
lands'
answered
aragorn
'saruman
has
fallen
under
it
rohan
is
beset
who
knows
what
you
will
find
there
if
ever
you
return'

not
this
at
least'
said
boromir
'that
they
will
buy
their
lives
with
horses
they
love
their
horses
next
to
their
kin
and
not
without
reason
for
the
horses
of
the
riddermark
come
from
the
fields
of
the
north
far
from
the
shadow
and
their
race
as
that
of
their
masters
is
descended
from
the
free
days
of
old'

'true
indeed'
said
gandalf
and
there
is
one
among
them
that
might
have
been
foaled
in
the
morning
of
the
world
the
horses
of
the
nine
cannot
vie
with
him
tireless
swift
as
the
flowing
wind
shadowfax
they
called
him
by
day
his
coat
glistens
like
silver
and
by
night
it
is
like
a
shade
and
he
passes
unseen
light
is
his
footfall
never
before
had
any
man
mounted
him
but
I
took
him
and
I
tamed
him
and
so
speedily
he
bore
me
that
I
reached
the
shire
when
frodo
was
on
the
barrowdowns
though
I
set
out
from
rohan
only
when
he
set
out
from
hobbiton

'but
fear
grew
in
me
as
I
rode
ever
as
I
came
north
I
heard
tidings
of
the
riders
and
though
I
gained
on
them
day
by
day
they
were
ever
before
me
they
had
divided
their
forces
I
learned
some
remained
on
the
eastern
borders
not
far
from
the
greenway
and
some
invaded
the
shire
from
the
south
I
came
to
hobbiton
and
frodo
had
gone
but
I
had
words
with
old
gamgee
many
words
and
few
to
the
point
he
had
much
to
say
about
the
shortcomings
of
the
new
owners
of
bag
end


I
can't
abide
changes
said
he
not
at
my
time
of
life
and
least
of
all
changes
for
the
worst
changes
for
the
worst
he
repeated
many
times

'
worst
is
a
bad
word
I
said
to
him
and
I
hope
you
do
not
live
to
see
it
but
amidst
his
talk
I
gathered
at
last
that
frodo
had
left
hobbiton
less
than
a
week
before
and
that
a
black
horseman
had
come
to
the
hill
the
same
evening
then
I
rode
on
in
fear
I
came
to
buckland
and
found
it
in
uproar
as
busy
as
a
hive
of
ants
that
has
been
stirred
with
a
stick
I
came
to
the
house
at
crickhollow
and
it
was
broken
open
and
empty
but
on
the
threshold
there
lay
a
cloak
that
had
been
frodo's
then
for
a
while
hope
left
me
and
I
did
not
wait
to
gather
news
or
I
might
have
been
comforted
but
I
rode
on
the
trail
of
the
riders
it
was
hard
to
follow
for
it
went
many
ways
and
I
was
at
a
loss
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
or
two
had
ridden
towards
bree
and
that
way
I
went
for
I
thought
of
words
that
might
be
said
to
the
innkeeper

'
butterbur
they
call
him
thought
I
if
this
delay
was
his
fault
I
will
melt
all
the
butter
in
him
I
will
roast
the
old
fool
over
a
slow
fire
he
expected
no
less
and
when
he
saw
my
face
he
fell
down
flat
and
began
to
melt
on
the
spot'

what
did
you
do
to
him'
cried
frodo
in
alarm
'he
was
really
very
kind
to
us
and
did
all
that
he
could'

gandalf
laughed
'don't
be
afraid'
he
said
I
did
not
bite
and
I
barked
very
little
so
overjoyed
was
I
by
the
news
that
I
got
out
of
him
when
he
stopped
quaking
that
I
embraced
the
old
fellow
how
it
happened
I
could
not
then
guess
but
I
learned
that
you
had
been
in
bree
the
night
before
and
had
gone
off
that
morning
with
strider


strider

I
cried
shouting
for
joy


yes
sir
I
am
afraid
so
sir
said
butterbur
mistaking
me
he
got
at
them
in
spite
of
all
that
I
could
do
and
they
took
up
with
him
they
behaved
very
queer
all
the
time
they
were
here
wilful
you
might
say


ass
fool
thrice
worthy
and
beloved
barliman

said
I
it's
the
best
news
I
have
had
since
midsummer
it's
worth
a
gold
piece
at
the
least
may
your
beer
be
laid
under
an
enchantment
of
surpassing
excellence
for
seven
years

said
I
now
I
can
take
a
night's
rest
the
first
since
I
have
forgotten
when


so
I
stayed
there
that
night
wondering
much
what
had
become
of
the
riders
for
only
of
two
had
there
yet
been
any
news
in
bree
it
seemed
but
in
the
night
we
heard
more
five
at
least
came
from
the
west
and
they
threw
down
the
gates
and
passed
through
bree
like
a
howling
wind
and
the
breefolk
are
still
shivering
and
expecting
the
end
of
the
world
I
got
up
before
dawn
and
went
after
them

'i
do
not
know
but
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
this
is
what
happened
their
captain
remained
in
secret
away
south
of
bree
while
two
rode
ahead
through
the
village
and
four
more
invaded
the
shire
but
when
these
were
foiled
in
bree
and
at
crickhollow
they
returned
to
their
captain
with
tidings
and
so
left
the
road
unguarded
for
a
while
except
by
their
spies
the
captain
then
sent
some
eastward
straight
across
country
and
he
himself
with
the
rest
rode
along
the
road
in
great
wrath

'i
galloped
to
weathertop
like
a
gale
and
I
reached
it
before
sundown
on
my
second
day
from
breeand
they
were
there
before
me
they
drew
away
from
me
for
they
felt
the
coming
of
my
anger
and
they
dared
not
face
it
while
the
sun
was
in
the
sky
but
they
closed
round
at
night
and
I
was
besieged
on
the
hilltop
in
the
old
ring
of
amon
sl
I
was
hard
put
to
it
indeed
such
light
and
flame
cannot
have
been
seen
on
weathertop
since
the
warbeacons
of
old

at
sunrise
I
escaped
and
fled
towards
the
north
I
could
not
hope
to
do
more
it
was
impossible
to
find
you
frodo
in
the
wilderness
and
it
would
have
been
folly
to
try
with
all
the
nine
at
my
heels
so
I
had
to
trust
to
aragorn
but
I
hoped
to
draw
some
of
them
off
and
yet
reach
rivendell
ahead
of
you
and
send
out
help
four
riders
did
indeed
follow
me
but
they
turned
back
after
a
while
and
made
for
the
ford
it
seems
that
helped
a
little
for
there
were
only
five
not
nine
when
your
camp
was
attacked

'i
reached
here
at
last
by
a
long
hard
road
up
the
hoarwell
and
through
the
ettenmoors
and
down
from
the
north
it
took
me
nearly
fourteen
days
from
weathertop
for
I
could
not
ride
among
the
rocks
of
the
trollfells
and
shadowfax
departed
I
sent
him
back
to
his
master
but
a
great
friendship
has
grown
between
us
and
if
I
have
need
he
will
come
at
my
call
but
so
it
was
that
I
came
to
rivendell
only
three
days
before
the
ring
and
news
of
its
peril
had
already
been
brought
herewhich
proved
well
indeed

and
that
frodo
is
the
end
of
my
account
may
elrond
and
the
others
forgive
the
length
of
it
but
such
a
thing
has
not
happened
before
that
gandalf
broke
tryst
and
did
not
come
when
he
promised
an
account
to
the
ringbearer
of
so
strange
an
event
was
required
I
think

'well
the
tale
is
now
told
from
first
to
last
here
we
all
are
and
here
is
the
ring
but
we
have
not
yet
come
any
nearer
to
our
purpose
what
shall
we
do
with
it'

there
was
silence
at
last
elrond
spoke
again

this
is
grievous
news
concerning
saruman'
he
said
for
we
trusted
him
and
he
is
deep
in
all
our
counsels
it
is
perilous
to
study
too
deeply
the
arts
of
the
enemy
for
good
or
for
ill
but
such
falls
and
betrayals
alas
have
happened
before
of
the
tales
that
we
have
heard
this
day
the
tale
of
frodo
was
most
strange
to
me
I
have
known
few
hobbits
save
bilbo
here
and
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
perhaps
not
so
alone
and
singular
as
I
had
thought
him
the
world
has
changed
much
since
I
last
was
on
the
westward
roads

the
barrowwights
we
know
by
many
names
and
of
the
old
forest
many
tales
have
been
told
all
that
now
remains
is
but
an
outlier
of
its
northern
march
time
was
when
a
squirrel
could
go
from
tree
to
tree
from
what
is
now
the
shire
to
dunland
west
of
isengard
in
those
lands
I
journeyed
once
and
many
things
wild
and
strange
I
knew
but
I
had
forgotten
bombadil
if
indeed
this
is
still
the
same
that
walked
the
woods
and
hills
long
ago
and
even
then
was
older
than
the
old
that
was
not
then
his
name
iarwain
benadar
we
called
him
oldest
and
fatherless
but
many
another
name
he
has
since
been
given
by
other
folk
forn
by
the
dwarves
orald
by
northern
men
and
other
names
beside
he
is
a
strange
creature
but
maybe
I
should
have
summoned
him
to
our

council'

he
would
not
have
come'
said
gandalf

could
we
not
still
send
messages
to
him
and
obtain
his
help'
asked
erestor
it
seems
that
he
has
a
power
even
over
the
ring'

no
I
should
not
put
it
so'
said
gandalf
say
rather
that
the
ring
has
no
power
over
him
he
is
his
own
master
but
he
cannot
alter
the
ring
itself
nor
break
its
power
over
others
and
now
he
is
withdrawn
into
a
little
land
within
bounds
that
he
has
set
though
none
can
see
them
waiting
perhaps
for
a
change
of
days
and
he
will
not
step
beyond
them'

but
within
those
bounds
nothing
seems
to
dismay
him'
said
erestor
would
he
not
take
the
ring
and
keep
it
there
for
ever
harmless'

no'
said
gandalf
not
willingly
he
might
do
so
if
all
the
free
folk
of
the
world
begged
him
but
he
would
not
understand
the
need
and
if
he
were
given
the
ring
he
would
soon
forget
it
or
most
likely
throw
it
away
such
things
have
no
hold
on
his
mind
he
would
be
a
most
unsafe
guardian
and
that
alone
is
answer
enough'

but
in
any
case'
said
glorfindel
to
send
the
ring
to
him
would
only
postpone
the
day
of
evil
he
is
far
away
we
could
not
now
take
it
back
to
him
unguessed
unmarked
by
any
spy
and
even
if
we
could
soon
or
late
the
lord
of
the
rings
would
learn
of
its
hiding
place
and
would
bend
all
his
power
towards
it
could
that
power
be
defied
by
bombadil
alone
I
think
not
I
think
that
in
the
end
if
all
else
is
conquered
bombadil
will
fall
last
as
he
was
first
and
then
night
will
come'

I
know
little
of
iarwain
save
the
name'
said
galdor
but
glorfindel
I
think
is
right
power
to
defy
our
enemy
is
not
in
him
unless
such
power
is
in
the
earth
itself
and
yet
we
see
that
sauron
can
torture
and
destroy
the
very
hills
what
power
still
remains
lies
with
us
here
in
imladris
or
with
cirdan
at
the
havens
or
in
lrien
but
have
they
the
strength
have
we
here
the
strength
to
withstand
the
enemy
the
coming
of
sauron
at
the
last
when
all
else
is
overthrown'

I
have
not
the
strength'
said
elrond
neither
have
they'

then
if
the
ring
cannot
be
kept
from
him
for
ever
by
strength'
said
glorfindel
two
things
only
remain
for
us
to
attempt
to
send
it
over
the
sea
or
to
destroy
it'

but
gandalf
has
revealed
to
us
that
we
cannot
destroy
it
by
any
craft
that
we
here
possess'
said
elrond
and
they
who
dwell
beyond
the
sea
would
not
receive
it
for
good
or
ill
it
belongs
to
middleearth
it
is
for
us
who
still
dwell
here
to
deal
with
it'

'then
said
glorfindel
'let
us
cast
it
into
the
deeps
and
so
make
the
lies
of
saruman
come
true
for
it
is
clear
now
that
even
at
the
council
his
feet
were
already
on
a
crooked
path
he
knew
that
the
ring
was
not
lost
for
ever
but
wished
us
to
think
so
for
he
began
to
lust
for
it
for
himself
yet
oft
in
lies
truth
is
hidden
in
the
sea
it
would
be
safe'

not
safe
for
ever'
said
gandalf
there
are
many
things
in
the
deep
waters
and
seas
and
lands
may
change
and
it
is
not
our
part
here
to
take
thought
only
for
a
season
or
for
a
few
lives
of
men
or
for
a
passing
age
of
the
world
we
should
seek
a
final
end
of
this
menace
even
if
we
do
not
hope
to
make
one'

'and
that
we
shall
not
find
on
the
roads
to
the
sea'
said
galdor
'if
the
return
to
iarwain
be
thought
too
dangerous
then
flight
to
the
sa
is
now
fraught
with
gravest
peril
my
heart
tells
me
that
sauron
will
expect
us
to
take
the
western
way
when
he
learns
what
has
befallen
he
soon
will
the
nine
have
been
unhorsed
indeed
but
that
is
but
a
respite
ere
they
find
new
steeds
and
swifter
only
the
waning
might
of
gondor
stands
now
between
him
and
a
march
in
power
along
the
coasts
into
the
north
and
if
he
comes
assailing
the
white
towers
and
the
havens
hereafter
the
elves
may
have
no
escape
from
the
lengthening
shadows
of
middleearth'

'long
yet
will
that
march
be
delayed'
said
boromir
'gondor
wanes
you
say
but
gondor
stands
and
even
the
end
of
its
strength
is
still
very
strong'

'and
yet
its
vigilance
can
no
longer
keep
back
the
nine'
said
galdor
'and
other
roads
he
may
find
that
gondor
does
not
guard'


'then'
said
erestor
there
are
but
two
courses
as
glorfindel
already
has
declared
to
hide
the
ring
for
ever
or
to
unmake
it
but
both
are
beyond
our
power
who
will
read
this
riddle
for
us'

'none
here
can
do
so'
said
elrond
gravely
at
least
none
can
foretell
what
will
come
to
pass
if
we
take
this
road
or
that
but
it
seems
to
me
now
clear
which
is
the
road
that
we
must
take
the
westward
road
seems
easiest
therefore
it
must
be
shunned
it
will
be
watched
too
often
the
elves
have
fled
that
way
now
at
this
last
we
must
take
a
hard
road
a
road
unforeseen
there
lies
our
hope
if
hope
it
be
to
walk
into
perilto
mordor
we
must
send
the
ring
to
the
fire'

silence
fell
again
frodo
even
in
that
fair
house
looking
out
upon
a
sunlit
valley
filled
with
the
noise
of
clear
waters
felt
a
dead
darkness
in
his
heart
boromir
stirred
and
frodo
looked
at
him
he
was
fingering
his
great
horn
and
frowning
at
length
he
spoke

'i
do
not
understand
all
this'
he
said
saruman
is
a
traitor
but
did
he
not
have
a
glimpse
of
wisdom
why
do
you
speak
ever
of
hiding
and
destroying
why
should
we
not
think
that
the
great
ring
has
come
into
our
hands
to
serve
us
in
the
very
hour
of
need
wielding
it
the
free
lords
of
the
free
may
surely
defeat
the
enemy
that
is
what
he
most
fears
I
deem

'the
men
of
gondor
are
valiant
and
they
will
never
submit
but
they
may
be
beaten
down
valour
needs
first
strength
and
then
a
weapon
let
the
ring
be
your
weapon
if
it
has
such
power
as
you
say
take
it
and
go
forth
to
victory'

'alas
no'
said
elrond
'we
cannot
use
the
ruling
ring
that
we
now
know
too
well
it
belongs
to
sauron
and
was
made
by
him
alone
and
is
altogether
evil
its
strength
boromir
is
too
great
for
anyone
to
wield
at
will
save
only
those
who
have
already
a
great
power
of
their
own
but
for
them
it
holds
an
even
deadlier
peril
the
very
desire
of
it
corrupts
the
heart
consider
saruman
if
any
of
the
wise
should
with
this
ring
overthrow
the
lord
of
mordor
using
his
own
arts
he
would
then
set
himself
on
sauron's
throne
and
yet
another
dark
lord
would
appear
and
that
is
another
reason
why
the
ring
should
be
destroyed
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
world
it
will
be
a
danger
even
to
the
wise
for
nothing
is
evil
in
the
beginning
even
sauron
was
not
so
I
fear
to
take
the
ring
to
hide
it
I
will
not
take
the
ring
to
wield
it'

nor
i'
said
gandalf

boromir
looked
at
them
doubtfully
but
he
bowed
his
head
so
be
it'
he
said
then
in
gondor
we
must
trust
to
such
weapons
as
we
have
and
at
the
least
while
the
wise
ones
guard
this
ring
we
will
fight
on
mayhap
the
swordthatwasbroken
may
still
stem
the
tide

if
the
hand
that
wields
it
has
inherited
not
an
heirloom
only
but
the
sinews
of
the
kings
of
men'

who
can
tell'
said
aragorn
but
we
will
put
it
to
the
test
one
day'

may
the
day
not
be
too
long
delayed'
said
boromir
'for
though
I
do
not
ask
for
aid
we
need
it
it
would
comfort
us
to
know
that
others
fought
also
with
all
the
means
that
they
have'

then
be
comforted'
said
elrond
for
there
are
other
powers
and
realms
that
you
know
not
and
they
are
hidden
from
you
anduin
the
great
flows
past
many
shores
ere
it
comes
to
argonath
and
the
gates
of
gondor'

'still
it
might
be
well
for
all'
said
glin
the
dwarf
'if
all
these
strengths
were
joined
and
the
powers
of
each
were
used
in
league
other
rings
there
may
be
less
treacherous
that
might
be
used
in
our
need
the
seven
are
lost
to
us

if
balin
has
not
found
the
ring
of
thrr
which
was
the
last
naught
has
been
heard
of
it
since
thrr
perished
in
moria
indeed
I
may
now
reveal
that
it
was
partly
in
hope
to
find
that
ring
that
balin
went
away'

balin
will
find
no
ring
in
moria'
said
gandalf
thrr
gave
it
to
thrin
his
son
but
not
thrin
to
thorin
it
was
taken
with
torment
from
thrin
in
the
dungeons
of
dol
guldur
I
came
too
late'

'ah
alas'
cried
glin
'when
will
the
day
come
of
our
revenge
but
still
there
are
the
three
what
of
the
three
rings
of
the
elves
very
mighty
rings
it
is
said
do
not
the
elflords
keep
them
yet
they
too
were
made
by
the
dark
lord
long
ago
are
they
idle
I
see
elflords
here
will
they
not
say'


the
elves
returned
no
answer
did
you
not
hear
me
glin'
said
elrond
the
three
were
not
made
by
sauron
nor
did
he
ever
touch
them
but
of
them
it
is
not
permitted
to
speak
so
much
only
in
this
hour
of
doubt
I
may
now
say
they
are
not
idle
but
they
were
not
made
as
weapons
of
war
or
conquest
that
is
not
their
power
those
who
made
them
did
not
desire
strength
or
domination
or
hoarded
wealth
but
understanding
making
and
healing
to
preserve
all
things
unstained
these
things
the
elves
of
middleearth
have
in
some
measure
gained
though
with
sorrow
but
all
that
has
been
wrought
by
those
who
wield
the
three
will
turn
to
their
undoing
and
their
minds
and
hearts
will
become
revealed
to
sauron
if
he
regains
the
one
it
would
be
better
if
the
three
had
never
been
that
is
his
purpose'

but
what
then
would
happen
if
the
ruling
ring
were
destroyed
as
you
counsel'
asked
glin

'we
know
not
for
certain'
answered
elrond
sadly
some
hope
that
the
three
rings
which
sauron
has
never
touched
would
then
become
free
and
their
rulers
might
heal
the
hurts
of
the
world
that
he
has
wrought
but
maybe
when
the
one
has
gone
the
three
will
fail
and
many
fair
things
will
fade
and
be
forgotten
that
is
my
belief'

yet
all
the
elves
are
willing
to
endure
this
chance'
said
glorfindel
'if
by
it
the
power
of
sauron
may
be
broken
and
the
fear
of
his
dominion
be
taken
away
for
ever'

'thus
we
return
once
more
to
the
destroying
of
the
ring'
said
erestor
and
yet
we
come
no
nearer
what
strength
have
we
for
the
finding
of
the
fire
in
which
it
was
made
that
is
the
path
of
despair
of
folly
I
would
say
if
the
long
wisdom
of
elrond
did
not
forbid
me'

'despair
or
folly'
said
gandalf
it
is
not
despair
for
despair
is
only
for
those
who
see
the
end
beyond
all
doubt
we
do
not
it
is
wisdom
to
recognize
necessity
when
all
other
courses
have
been
weighed
though
as
folly
it
may
appear
to
those
who
cling
to
false
hope
well
let
folly
be
our
cloak
a
veil
before
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
for
he
is
very
wise
and
weighs
all
things
to
a
nicety
in
the
scales
of
his
malice
but
the
only
measure
that
he
knows
is
desire
desire
for
power
and
so
he
judges
all
hearts
into
his
heart
the
thought
will
not
enter
that
any
will
refuse
it
that
having
the
ring
we
may
seek
to
destroy
it
if
we
seek
this
we
shall
put
him
out
of
reckoning'

'at
least
for
a
while'
said
elrond
the
road
must
be
trod
but
it
will
be
very
hard
and
neither
strength
nor
wisdom
will
carry
us
far
upon
it
this
quest
may
be
attempted
by
the
weak
with
as
much
hope
as
the
strong
yet
such
is
oft
the
course
of
deeds
that
move
the
wheels
of
the
world
small
hands
do
them
because
they
must
while
the
eyes
of
the
great
are
elsewhere'

'very
well
very
well
master
elrond'
said
bilbo
suddenly
'say
no
more
it
is
plain
enough
what
you
are
pointing
at
bilbo
the
silly
hobbit
started
this
affair
and
bilbo
had
better
finish
it
or
himself
I
was
very
comfortable
here
and
getting
on
with
my
book
if
you
want
to
know
I
am
just
writing
an
ending
for
it
I
had
thought
of
putting

and
he
lived
happily
ever
afterwards
to
the
end
of
his
days

it
is
a
good
ending
and
none
the
worse
for
having
been
used
before
now
I
shall
have
to
alter
that
it
does
not
look
like
coming
true
and
anyway
there
will
evidently
have
to
be
several
more
chapters
if
I
live
to
write
them
it
is
a
frightful
nuisance
when
ought
I
to
start

'
boromir
looked
in
surprise
at
bilbo
but
the
laughter
died
on
his
lips
when
he
saw
that
all
the
others
regarded
the
old
hobbit
with
grave
respect
only
glin
smiled
but
his
smile
came
from
old
memories

of
course
my
dear
bilbo'
said
gandalf
if
you
had
really
started
this
affair
you
might
be
expected
to
finish
it
but
you
know
well
enough
now
that

starting

is
too
great
a
claim
for
any
and
that
only
a
small
part
is
played
in
great
deeds
by
any
hero
you
need
not
bow
though
the
word
was
meant
and
we
do
not
doubt
that
under
jest
you
are
making
a
valiant
offer
but
one
beyond
your
strength
bilbo
you
cannot
take
this
thing
back
it
has
passed
on
if
you
need
my
advice
any
longer
I
should
say
that
your
part
is
ended
unless
as
a
recorder
finish
your
book
and
leave
the
ending
unaltered
there
is
still
hope
for
it
but
get
ready
to
write
a
sequel
when
they
come
back'


bilbo
laughed
I
have
never
known
you
give
me
pleasant
advice
before'
he
said
as
all
your
unpleasant
advice
has
been
good
I
wonder
if
this
advice
is
not
bad
still
I
don't
suppose
I
have
the
strength
or
luck
left
to
deal
with
the
ring
it
has
grown
and
I
have
not
but
tell
me
what
do
you
mean
by

they
'

the
messengers
who
are
sent
with
the
ring'

exactly
and
who
are
they
to
be
that
seems
to
me
what
this
council
has
to
decide
and
all
that
it
has
to
decide
elves
may
thrive
on
speech
alone
and
dwarves
endure
great
weariness
but
I
am
only
an
old
hobbit
and
I
miss
my
meal
at
noon
can't
you
think
of
some
names
now
or
put
it
off
till
after
dinner'

no
one
answered
the
noonbell
rang
still
no
one
spoke
frodo
glanced
at
all
the
faces
but
they
were
not
turned
to
him
all
the
council
sat
with
downcast
eyes
as
if
in
deep
thought
a
great
dread
fell
on
him
as
if
he
was
awaiting
the
pronouncement
of
some
doom
that
he
had
long
foreseen
and
vainly
hoped
might
after
all
never
be
spoken
an
overwhelming
longing
to
rest
and
remain
at
peace
by
bilbo's
side
in
rivendell
filled
all
his
heart
at
last
with
an
effort
he
spoke
and
wondered
to
hear
his
own
words
as
if
some
other
will
was
using
his
small
voice

I
will
take
the
ring'
he
said
though
I
do
not
know
the
way'

elrond
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
him
and
frodo
felt
his
heart
pierced
by
the
sudden
keenness
of
the
glance
if
I
understand
aright
all
that
I
have
heard'
he
said
I
think
that
this
task
is
appointed
for
you
frodo
and
that
if
you
do
not
find
a
way
no
one
will
this
is
the
hour
of
the
shirefolk
when
they
arise
from
their
quiet
fields
to
shake
the
towers
and
counsels
of
the
great
who
of
all
the
wise
could
have
foreseen
it
or
if
they
are
wise
why
should
they
expect
to
know
it
until
the
hour
has
struck

but
it
is
a
heavy
burden
so
heavy
that
none
could
lay
it
on
another
I
do
not
lay
it
on
you
but
if
you
take
it
freely
I
will
say
that
your
choice
is
right
and
though
all
the
mighty
elffriends
of
old
hador
and
hrin
and
trin
and
beren
himself
were
assembled
together
your
seat
should
be
among
them'

but
you
won't
send
him
off
alone
surely
master'
cried
sam
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
and
jumping
up
from
the
corner
where
he
had
been
quietly
sitting
on
the
floor

no
indeed'
said
elrond
turning
towards
him
with
a
smile
you
at
least
shall
go
with
him
it
is
hardly
possible
to
separate
you
from
him
even
when
he
is
summoned
to
a
secret
council
and
you
are
not'

sam
sat
down
blushing
and
muttering
a
nice
pickle
we
have
landed
ourselves
in
mr
frodo'
he
said
shaking
his
head


chapter
3


the
ring
goes
south


later
that
day
the
hobbits
held
a
meeting
of
their
own
in
bilbo's
room
merry
and
pippin
were
indignant
when
they
heard
that
sam
had
crept
into
the
council
and
had
been
chosen
as
frodo's
companion

it's
most
unfair'
said
pippin
instead
of
throwing
him
out
and
clapping
him
in
chains
elrond
goes
and
rewards
him
for
his
cheek'

rewards'
said
frodo
'i
can't
imagine
a
more
severe
punishment
you
are
not
thinking
what
you
are
saying
condemned
to
go
on
this
hopeless
journey
a
reward
yesterday
I
dreamed
that
my
task
was
done
and
I
could
rest
here
a
long
while
perhaps
for
good'


'i
don't
wonder'
said
merry
'and
I
wish
you
could
but
we
are
envying
sam
not
you
if
you
have
to
go
then
it
will
be
a
punishment
for
any
of
us
to
be
left
behind
even
in
rivendell
we
have
come
a
long
way
with
you
and
been
through
some
stiff
times
we
want
to
go
on'

that's
what
I
meant'
said
pippin
we
hobbits
ought
to
stick
together
and
we
will
I
shall
go
unless
they
chain
me
up
there
must
be
someone
with
intelligence
in
the
party'

'then
you
certainly
will
not
be
chosen
peregrin
took'
said
gandalf
looking
in
through
the
window
which
was
near
the
ground
but
you
are
all
worrying
yourselves
unnecessarily
nothing
is
decided
yet'

nothing
decided'
cried
pippin
'then
what
were
you
all
doing
you
were
shut
up
for
hours'

talking'
said
bilbo
there
was
a
deal
of
talk
and
everyone
had
an
eyeopener
even
old
gandalf
I
think
legolas's
bit
of
news
about
gollum
caught
even
him
on
the
hop
though
he
passed
it
off'

you
were
wrong'
said
gandalf
'you
were
inattentive
I
had
already
heard
of
it
from
gwaihir
if
you
want
to
know
the
only
real
eyeopeners
as
you
put
it
were
you
and
frodo
and
I
was
the
only
one
that
was
not
surprised'

well
anyway'
said
bilbo
'nothing
was
decided
beyond
choosing
poor
frodo
and
sam
I
was
afraid
all
the
time
that
it
might
come
to
that
if
I
was
let
off
but
if
you
ask
me
elrond
will
send
out
a
fair
number
when
the
reports
come
in
have
they
started
yet
gandalf'

'yes'
said
the
wizard
some
of
the
scouts
have
been
sent
out
already
more
will
go
tomorrow
elrond
is
sending
elves
and
they
will
get
in
touch
with
the
rangers
and
maybe
with
thranduil's
folk
in
mirkwood
and
aragorn
has
gone
with
elrond's
sons
we
shall
have
to
scour
the
lands
all
round
for
many
long
leagues
before
any
move
is
made
so
cheer
up
frodo
you
will
probably
make
quite
a
long
stay
here'

'ah'
said
sam
gloomily
'we'll
just
wait
long
enough
for
winter
to
come'

'that
can't
be
helped'
said
bilbo
'it's
your
fault
partly
frodo
my
lad
insisting
on
waiting
for
my
birthday
a
funny
way
of
honouring
it
I
can't
help
thinking
not
the
day
I
should
have
chosen
for
letting
the
sbs
into
bag
end
but
there
it
is
you
can't
wait
now
fill
spring
and
you
can't
go
till
the
reports
come
back

when
winter
first
begins
to
bite

and
stones
crack
in
the
frosty
night

when
pools
are
black
and
trees
are
bare

'tis
evil
in
the
wild
to
fare


but
that
I
am
afraid
will
be
just
your
luck'

'i
am
afraid
it
will'
said
gandalf
'we
can't
start
until
we
have
found
out
about
the
riders'

I
thought
they
were
all
destroyed
in
the
flood'
said
merry

'you
cannot
destroy
ringwraiths
like
that'
said
gandalf
the
power
of
their
master
is
in
them
and
they
stand
or
fall
by
him
we
hope
that
they
were
all
unhorsed
and
unmasked
and
so
made
for
a
while
less
dangerous
but
we
must
find
out
for
certain
in
the
meantime
you
should
try
and
forget
your
troubles
frodo
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
do
anything
to
help
you
but
I
will
whisper
this
in
your
ears
someone
said
that
intelligence
would
be
needed
in
the
party
he
was
right
I
think
I
shall
come
with
you'

so
great
was
frodo's
delight
at
this
announcement
that
gandalf
left
the
windowsill
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
'i
only
said

I
think
I
shall
come

do
not
count
on
anything
yet
in
this
matter
elrond
will
have
much
to
say
and
your
friend
the
strider
which
reminds
me
I
want
to
see
elrond
I
must
be
off'

how
long
do
you
think
I
shall
have
here'
said
frodo
to
bilbo
when
gandalf
had
gone


oh
I
don't
know
I
can't
count
days
in
rivendell'
said
bilbo
'but
quite
long
I
should
think
we
can
have
many
a
good
talk
what
about
helping
me
with
my
book
and
making
a
start
on
the
next
have
you
thought
of
an
ending'

'yes
several
and
all
are
dark
and
unpleasant'
said
frodo

'oh
that
won't
do'
said
bilbo
books
ought
to
have
good
endings
how
would
this
do

and
they
all
settled
down
and
lived
together
happily
ever
after
'

it
will
do
well
if
it
ever
comes
to
that'
said
frodo

'ah'
said
sam
'and
where
will
they
live
that's
what
I
often
wonder'

for
a
while
the
hobbits
continued
to
talk
and
think
of
the
past
journey
and
of
the
perils
that
lay
ahead
but
such
was
the
virtue
of
the
land
of
rivendell
that
soon
all
fear
and
anxiety
was
lifted
from
their
minds
the
future
good
or
ill
was
not
forgotten
but
ceased
to
have
any
power
over
the
present
health
and
hope
grew
strong
in
them
and
they
were
content
with
each
good
day
as
it
came
taking
pleasure
in
every
meal
and
in
every
word
and
song

so
the
days
slipped
away
as
each
morning
dawned
bright
and
fair
and
each
evening
followed
cool
and
clear
but
autumn
was
waning
fast
slowly
the
golden
light
faded
to
pale
silver
and
the
lingering
leaves
fell
from
the
naked
trees
a
wind
began
to
blow
chill
from
the
misty
mountains
to
the
east
the
hunter's
moon
waxed
round
in
the
night
sky
and
put
to
flight
all
the
lesser
stars
but
low
in
the
south
one
star
shone
red
every
night
as
the
moon
waned
again
it
shone
brighter
and
brighter
frodo
could
see
it
from
his
window
deep
in
the
heavens
burning
like
a
watchful
eye
that
glared
above
the
trees
on
the
brink
of
the
valley

the
hobbits
had
been
nearly
two
months
in
the
house
of
elrond
and
november
had
gone
by
with
the
last
shreds
of
autumn
and
december
was
passing
when
the
scouts
began
to
return
some
had
gone
north
beyond
the
springs
of
the
hoarwell
into
the
ettenmoors
and
others
had
gone
west
and
with
the
help
of
aragorn
and
the
rangers
had
searched
the
lands
far
down
the
greyflood
as
far
as
tharbad
where
the
old
north
road
crossed
the
river
by
a
ruined
town
many
had
gone
east
and
south
and
some
of
these
had
crossed
the
mountains
and
entered
mirkwood
while
others
had
climbed
the
pass
at
the
source
of
the
gladden
river
and
had
come
down
into
wilderland
and
over
the
gladden
fields
and
so
at
length
had
reached
the
old
home
of
radagast
at
rhosgobel
radagast
was
not
there
and
they
had
returned
over
the
high
pass
that
was
called
the
dimrill
stair
the
sons
of
elrond
elladan
and
elrohir
were
the
last
to
return
they
had
made
a
great
journey
passing
down
the
silverlode
into
a
strange
country
but
of
their
errand
they
would
not
speak
to
any
save
to
elrond

in
no
region
had
the
messengers
discovered
any
signs
or
tidings
of
the
riders
or
other
servants
of
the
enemy
even
from
the
eagles
of
the
misty
mountains
they
had
learned
no
fresh
news
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
of
gollum
but
the
wild
wolves
were
still
gathering
and
were
hunting
again
far
up
the
great
river
three
of
the
black
horses
had
been
found
at
once
drowned
in
the
flooded
ford
on
the
rocks
of
the
rapids
below
it
searchers
discovered
the
bodies
of
five
more
and
also
a
long
black
cloak
slashed
and
tattered
of
the
black
riders
no
other
trace
was
to
be
seen
and
nowhere
was
their
presence
to
be
felt
it
seemed
that
they
had
vanished
from
the
north

'eight
out
of
the
nine
are
accounted
for
at
least'
said
gandalf
'it
is
rash
to
be
too
sure
yet
I
think
that
we
may
hope
now
that
the
ringwraiths
were
scattered
and
have
been
obliged
to
return
as
best
they
could
to
their
master
in
mordor
empty
and
shapeless

if
that
is
so
it
will
be
some
time
before
they
can
begin
the
hunt
again
of
course
the
enemy
has
other
servants
but
they
will
have
to
journey
all
the
way
to
the
borders
of
rivendell
before
they
can
pick
up
our
trail
and
if
we
are
careful
that
will
be
hard
to
find
but
we
must
delay
no
longer'

elrond
summoned
the
hobbits
to
him
he
looked
gravely
at
frodo
'the
time
has
come'
he
said
if
the
ring
is
to
set
out
it
must
go
soon
but
those
who
go
with
it
must
not
count
on
their
errand
being
aided
by
war
or
force
they
must
pass
into
the
domain
of
the
enemy
far
from
aid
do
you
still
hold
to
your
word
frodo
that
you
will
be
the
ringbearer'

'i
do'
said
frodo
I
will
go
with
sam'


then
I
cannot
help
you
much
not
even
with
counsel'
said
elrond
I
can
foresee
very
little
of
your
road
and
how
your
task
is
to
be
achieved
I
do
not
know
the
shadow
has
crept
now
to
the
feet
of
the
mountains
and
draws
nigh
even
to
the
borders
of
greyflood
and
under
the
shadow
all
is
dark
to
me
you
will
meet
many
foes
some
open
and
some
disguised
and
you
may
find
friends
upon
your
way
when
you
least
look
for
it
I
will
send
out
messages
such
as
I
can
contrive
to
those
whom
I
know
in
the
wide
world
but
so
perilous
are
the
lands
now
become
that
some
may
well
miscarry
or
come
no
quicker
than
you
yourself

and
I
will
choose
you
companions
to
go
with
you
as
far
as
they
will
or
fortune
allows
the
number
must
be
few
since
your
hope
is
in
speed
and
secrecy
had
I
a
host
of
elves
in
armour
of
the
elder
days
it
would
avail
little
save
to
arouse
the
power
of
mordor

the
company
of
the
ring
shall
be
nine
and
the
nine
walkers
shall
be
set
against
the
nine
riders
that
are
evil
with
you
and
your
faithful
servant
gandalf
will
go
for
this
shall
be
his
great
task
and
maybe
the
end
of
his
labours

for
the
rest
they
shall
represent
the
other
free
peoples
of
the
world
elves
dwarves
and
men
legolas
shall
be
for
the
elves
and
gimli
son
of
glin
for
the
dwarves
they
are
willing
to
go
at
least
to
the
passes
of
the
mountains
and
maybe
beyond
for
men
you
shall
have
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
for
the
ring
of
isildur
concerns
him
closely'

strider'
said
frodo

'yes'
he
said
with
a
smile
I
ask
leave
once
again
to
be
your
companion
frodo'

I
would
have
begged
you
to
come'
said
frodo
'only
I
thought
you
were
going
to
minas
tirith
with
boromir'

I
am'
said
aragorn
and
the
swordthatwasbroken
shall
be
reforged
ere
I
set
out
to
war
but
your
road
and
our
road
lie
together
for
many
hundreds
of
miles
therefore
boromir
will
also
be
in
the
company
he
is
a
valiant
man'

'there
remain
two
more
to
be
found'
said
elrond
these
I
will
consider
of
my
household
I
may
find
some
that
it
seems
good
to
me
to
send'

but
that
will
leave
no
place
for
us'
cried
pippin
in
dismay
we
don't
want
to
be
left
behind
we
want
to
go
with
frodo'

that
is
because
you
do
not
understand
and
cannot
imagine
what
lies
ahead'
said
elrond

neither
does
frodo'
said
gandalf
unexpectedly
supporting
pippin
'nor
do
any
of
us
see
clearly
it
is
true
that
if
these
hobbits
understood
the
danger
they
would
not
dare
to
go
but
they
would
still
wish
to
go
or
wish
that
they
dared
and
be
shamed
and
unhappy
I
think
elrond
that
in
this
matter
it
would
be
well
to
trust
rather
to
their
friendship
than
to
great
wisdom
even
if
you
chose
for
us
an
elflord
such
as
glorfindel
he
could
not
storm
the
dark
tower
nor
open
the
road
to
the
fire
by
the
power
that
is
in
him'

you
speak
gravely'
said
elrond
but
I
am
in
doubt
the
shire
I
forebode
is
not
free
now
from
peril
and
these
two
I
had
thought
to
send
back
there
as
messengers
to
do
what
they
could
according
to
the
fashion
of
their
country
to
warn
the
people
of
their
danger
in
any
case
I
judge
that
the
younger
of
these
two
peregrin
took
should
remain
my
heart
is
against
his
going'

then
master
elrond
you
will
have
to
lock
me
in
prison
or
send
me
home
tied
in
a
sack'
said
pippin
for
otherwise
I
shall
follow
the
company'

let
it
be
so
then
you
shall
go'
said
elrond
and
he
sighed
'now
the
tale
of
nine
is
filled
in
seven
days
the
company
must
depart'

the
sword
of
elendil
was
forged
anew
by
elvish
smiths
and
on
its
blade
was
traced
a
device
of
seven
stars
set
between
the
crescent
moon
and
the
rayed
sun
and
about
them
was
written
many
runes
for
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
was
going
to
war
upon
the
marches
of
mordor
very
bright
was
that
sword
when
it
was
made
whole
again
the
light
of
the
sun
shone
redly
in
it
and
the
light
of
the
moon
shone
cold
and
its
edge
was
hard
and
keen
and
aragorn
gave
it
a
new
name
and
called
it
andril
flame
of
the
west


aragorn
and
gandalf
walked
together
or
sat
speaking
of
their
road
and
the
perils
they
would
meet
and
they
pondered
the
storied
and
figured
maps
and
books
of
lore
that
were
in
the
house
of
elrond
sometimes
frodo
was
with
them
but
he
was
content
to
lean
on
their
guidance
and
he
spent
as
much
time
as
he
could
with
bilbo

in
those
last
days
the
hobbits
sat
together
in
the
evening
in
the
hall
of
fire
and
there
among
many
tales
they
heard
told
in
full
the
lay
of
beren
and
lthien
and
the
winning
of
the
great
jewel
but
in
the
day
while
merry
and
pippin
were
out
and
about
frodo
and
sam
were
to
be
found
with
bilbo
in
his
own
small
room
then
bilbo
would
read
passages
from
his
book
which
still
seemed
very
incomplete
or
scraps
of
his
verses
or
would
take
notes
of
frodo's
adventures

on
the
morning
of
the
last
day
frodo
was
alone
with
bilbo
and
the
old
hobbit
pulled
out
from
under
his
bed
a
wooden
box
he
lifted
the
lid
and
fumbled
inside

'here
is
your
sword'
he
said
'but
it
was
broken
you
know
I
took
it
to
keep
it
safe
but
i've
forgotten
to
ask
if
the
smiths
could
mend
it
no
time
now
so
I
thought
perhaps
you
would
care
to
have
this
don't
you
know'

he
took
from
the
box
a
small
sword
in
an
old
shabby
leathern
scabbard
then
he
drew
it
and
its
polished
and
welltended
blade
glittered
suddenly
cold
and
bright
'this
is
sting'
he
said
and
thrust
it
with
little
effort
deep
into
a
wooden
beam
take
it
if
you
like
I
shan't
want
it
again
I
expect'

frodo
accepted
it
gratefully

'also
there
is
this'
said
bilbo
bringing
out
a
parcel
which
seemed
to
be
rather
heavy
for
its
size
he
unwound
several
folds
of
old
cloth
and
held
up
a
small
shirt
of
mail
it
was
closewoven
of
many
rings
as
supple
almost
as
linen
cold
as
ice
and
harder
than
steel
it
shone
like
moonlit
silver
and
was
studded
with
white
gems
with
it
was
a
belt
of
pearl
and
crystal

'it's
a
pretty
thing
isn't
it'
said
bilbo
moving
it
in
the
light
and
useful
it
is
my
dwarfmail
that
thorin
gave
me
I
got
it
back
from
michel
delving
before
I
started
and
packed
it
with
my
luggage
I
brought
all
the
mementoes
of
my
journey
away
with
me
except
the
ring
but
I
did
not
expect
to
use
this
and
I
don't
need
it
now
except
to
look
at
sometimes
you
hardly
feel
any
weight
when
you
put
it
on'

I
should
look

well
I
don't
think
I
should
look
right
in
it'
said
frodo

just
what
I
said
myself'
said
bilbo
'but
never
mind
about
looks
you
can
wear
it
under
your
outer
clothes
come
on
you
must
share
this
secret
with
me
don't
tell
anybody
else
but
I
should
feel
happier
if
I
knew
you
were
wearing
it
I
have
a
fancy
it
would
turn
even
the
knives
of
the
black
riders'
he
ended
in
a
low
voice

very
well
I
will
take
it'
said
frodo
bilbo
put
it
on
him
and
fastened
sting
upon
the
glittering
belt
and
then
frodo
put
over
the
top
his
old
weatherstained
breeches
tunic
and
jacket

'just
a
plain
hobbit
you
look'
said
bilbo
'but
there
is
more
about
you
now
than
appears
on
the
surface
good
luck
to
you'
he
turned
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
trying
to
hum
a
tune

'i
cannot
thank
you
as
I
should
bilbo
for
this
and
for
all
our
past
kindnesses'
said
frodo

'don't
try'
said
the
old
hobbit
turning
round
and
slapping
him
on
the
back
ow'
he
cried
you
are
too
hard
now
to
slap
but
there
you
are
hobbits
must
stick
together
and
especially
bagginses
all
I
ask
in
return
is
take
as
much
care
of
yourself
as
you
can
and
bring
back
all
the
news
you
can
and
any
old
songs
and
tales
you
can
come
by
i'll
do
my
best
to
finish
my
book
before
you
return
I
should
like
to
write
the
second
book
if
I
am
spared'
he
broke
off
and
turned
to
the
window
again
singing
softly

I
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think

of
all
that
I
have
seen

of
meadowflowers
and
butterflies

in
summers
that
have
been



of
yellow
leaves
and
gossamer

in
autumns
that
there
were

with
morning
mist
and
silver
sun

and
wind
upon
my
hair


I
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think

of
how
the
world
will
be

when
winter
comes
without
a
spring

that
I
shall
ever
see


for
still
there
are
so
many
things

that
I
have
never
seen

in
every
wood
in
every
spring

there
is
a
different
green


I
sit
beside
the
fire
and
think

of
people
long
ago

and
people
who
will
see
a
world

that
I
shall
never
know


but
all
the
while
I
sit
and
think

of
times
there
were
before

I
listen
for
returning
feet

and
voices
at
the
door


it
was
a
cold
grey
day
near
the
end
of
december
the
east
wind
was
streaming
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
trees
and
seething
in
the
dark
pines
on
the
hills
ragged
clouds
were
hurrying
overhead
dark
and
low
as
the
cheerless
shadows
of
the
early
evening
began
to
fall
the
company
made
ready
to
set
out
they
were
to
start
at
dusk
for
elrond
counselled
them
to
journey
under
cover
of
night
as
often
as
they
could
until
they
were
far
from
rivendell

you
should
fear
the
many
eyes
of
the
servants
of
sauron'
he
said
'i
do
not
doubt
that
news
of
the
discomfiture
of
the
riders
has
already
reached
him
and
he
will
be
filled
with
wrath
soon
now
his
spies
on
foot
and
wing
will
be
abroad
in
the
northern
lands
even
of
the
sky
above
you
must
beware
as
you
go
on
your
way'

the
company
took
little
gear
of
war
for
their
hope
was
in
secrecy
not
in
battle
aragorn
had
andril
but
no
other
weapon
and
he
went
forth
clad
only
in
rusty
green
and
brown
as
a
ranger
of
the
wilderness
boromir
had
a
long
sword
in
fashion
like
andril
but
of
less
lineage
and
he
bore
also
a
shield
and
his
warhorn

'loud
and
clear
it
sounds
in
the
valleys
of
the
hills'
he
said
and
then
let
all
the
foes
of
gondor
flee'
putting
it
to
his
lips
he
blew
a
blast
and
the
echoes
leapt
from
rock
to
rock
and
all
that
heard
that
voice
in
rivendell
sprang
to
their
feet

slow
should
you
be
to
wind
that
horn
again
boromir
said
elrond
'until
you
stand
once
more
on
the
borders
of
your
land
and
dire
need
is
on
you'
maybe'
said
boromir
'but
always
I
have
let
my
horn
cry
at
setting
forth
and
though
thereafter
we
may
walk
in
the
shadows
I
will
not
go
forth
as
a
thief
in
the
night'

gimli
the
dwarf
alone
wore
openly
a
short
shirt
of
steelrings
for
dwarves
make
light
of
burdens
and
in
his
belt
was
a
broadbladed
axe
legolas
had
a
bow
and
a
quiver
and
at
his
belt
a
long
white
knife
the
younger
hobbits
wore
the
swords
that
they
had
taken
from
the
barrow
but
frodo
took
only
sting
and
his
mailcoat
as
bilbo
wished
remained
hidden
gandalf
bore
his
staff
but
girt
at
his
side
was
the
elvensword
glamdring
the
mate
of
orcrist
that
lay
now
upon
the
breast
of
thorin
under
the
lonely
mountain

all
were
well
furnished
by
elrond
with
thick
warm
clothes
and
they
had
jackets
and
cloaks
lined
with
fur
spare
food
and
clothes
and
blankets
and
other
needs
were
laden
on
a
pony
none
other
than
the
poor
beast
that
they
had
brought
from
bree

he
stay
in
rivendell
had
worked
a
great
wonder
of
change
on
him
he
was
glossy
and
seemed
to
have
the
vigour
of
youth
it
was
sam
who
had
insisted
on
choosing
him
declaring
that
bill
as
he
called
him
would
pine
if
he
did
not
come

that
animal
can
nearly
talk'
he
said
and
would
talk
if
he
stayed
here
much
longer
he
gave
me
a
look
as
plain
as
mr
pippin
could
speak
it
if
you
don't
let
me
go
with
you
sam
i'll
follow
on
my
own'
so
bill
was
going
as
the
beast
of
burden
yet
he
was
the
only
member
of
the
company
that
did
not
seem
depressed

their
farewells
had
been
said
in
the
great
hall
by
the
fire
and
they
were
only
waiting
now
for
gandalf
who
had
not
yet
come
out
of
the
house
a
gleam
of
firelight
came
from
the
open
doors
and
soft
lights
were
glowing
in
many
windows
bilbo
huddled
in
a
cloak
stood
silent
on
the
doorstep
beside
frodo
aragorn
sat
with
his
head
bowed
to
his
knees
only
elrond
knew
fully
what
this
hour
meant
to
him
the
others
could
be
seen
as
grey
shapes
in
the
darkness

sam
was
standing
by
the
pony
sucking
his
teeth
and
staring
moodily
into
the
gloom
where
the
river
roared
stonily
below
his
desire
for
adventure
was
at
its
lowest
ebb

bill
my
lad'
he
said
you
oughtn't
to
have
took
up
with
us
you
could
have
stayed
here
and
et
the
best
hay
till
the
new
grass
comes'
bill
swished
his
tail
and
said
nothing

sam
eased
the
pack
on
his
shoulders
and
went
over
anxiously
in
his
mind
all
the
things
that
he
had
stowed
in
it
wondering
if
he
had
forgotten
anything
his
chief
treasure
his
cooking
gear
and
the
little
box
of
salt
that
he
always
carried
and
refilled
when
he
could
a
good
supply
of
pipeweed
but
not
near
enough
i'll
warrant
flint
and
tinder
woollen
hose
linen
various
small
belongings
of
his
master's
that
frodo
had
forgotten
and
sam
had
stowed
to
bring
them
out
in
triumph
when
they
were
called
for
he
went
through
them
all

'rope'
he
muttered
no
rope
and
only
last
night
you
said
to
yourself
sam
what
about
a
bit
of
rope
you'll
want
it
if
you
haven't
got
it
well
i'll
want
it
I
can't
get
it
now'

at
that
moment
elrond
came
out
with
gandalf
and
he
called
the
company
to
him
'this
is
my
last
word'
he
said
in
a
low
voice
'the
ringbearer
is
setting
out
on
the
quest
of
mount
doom
on
him
alone
is
any
charge
laid
neither
to
cast
away
the
ring
nor
to
deliver
it
to
any
servant
of
the
enemy
nor
indeed
to
let
any
handle
it
save
members
of
the
company
and
the
council
and
only
then
in
gravest
need
the
others
go
with
him
as
free
companions
to
help
him
on
his
way
you
may
tarry
or
come
back
or
turn
aside
into
other
paths
as
chance
allows
the
further
you
go
the
less
easy
will
it
be
to
withdraw
yet
no
oath
or
bond
is
laid
on
you
to
go
further
than
you
will
for
you
do
not
yet
know
the
strength
of
your
hearts
and
you
cannot
foresee
what
each
may
meet
upon
the
road'

faithless
is
he
that
says
farewell
when
the
road
darkens'
said
gimli

'maybe'
said
elrond
but
let
him
not
vow
to
walk
in
the
dark
who
has
not
seen
the
nightfall'

'yet
sworn
word
may
strengthen
quaking
heart'
said
gimli

or
break
it'
said
elrond
look
not
too
far
ahead
but
go
now
with
good
hearts
farewell
and
may
the
blessing
of
elves
and
men
and
all
free
folk
go
with
you
may
the
stars
shine
upon
your
faces'

'good



good
luck'
cried
bilbo
stuttering
with
the
cold
'i
don't
suppose
you
will
be
able
to
keep
a
diary
frodo
my
lad
but
I
shall
expect
a
full
account
when
you
get
back
and
don't
be
too
long
farewell'


many
others
of
elrond's
household
stood
in
the
shadows
and
watched
them
go
bidding
them
farewell
with
soft
voices
there
was
no
laughter
and
no
song
or
music
at
last
they
turned
away
and
faded
silently
into
the
dusk

they
crossed
the
bridge
and
wound
slowly
up
the
long
steep
paths
that
led
out
of
the
cloven
vale
of
rivendell
and
they
came
at
length
to
the
high
moor
where
the
wind
hissed
through
the
heather
then
with
one
glance
at
the
last
homely
house
twinkling
below
them
they
strode
away
far
into
the
night

at
the
ford
of
bruinen
they
left
the
road
and
turning
southwards
went
on
by
narrow
paths
among
the
folded
lands
their
purpose
was
to
hold
this
course
west
of
the
mountains
for
many
miles
and
days
the
country
was
much
rougher
and
more
barren
than
in
the
green
vale
of
the
great
river
in
wilderland
on
the
other
side
of
the
range
and
their
going
would
be
slow
but
they
hoped
in
this
way
to
escape
the
notice
of
unfriendly
eyes
the
spies
of
sauron
had
hitherto
seldom
been
seen
in
this
empty
country
and
the
paths
were
little
known
except
to
the
people
of
rivendell

gandalf
walked
in
front
and
with
him
went
aragorn
who
knew
this
land
even
in
the
dark
the
others
were
in
file
behind
and
legolas
whose
eyes
were
keen
was
the
rearguard
the
first
part
of
their
journey
was
hard
and
dreary
and
frodo
remembered
little
of
it
save
the
wind
for
many
sunless
days
an
icy
blast
came
from
the
mountains
in
the
east
and
no
garment
seemed
able
to
keep
out
its
searching
fingers
though
the
company
was
well
clad
they
seldom
felt
warm
either
moving
or
at
rest
they
slept
uneasily
during
the
middle
of
the
day
in
some
hollow
of
the
land
or
hidden
under
the
tangled
thornbushes
that
grew
in
thickets
in
many
places
in
the
late
afternoon
they
were
roused
by
the
watch
and
took
their
chief
meal
cold
and
cheerless
as
a
rule
for
they
could
seldom
risk
the
lighting
of
a
fire
in
the
evening
they
went
on
again
always
as
nearly
southward
as
they
could
find
a
way

at
first
it
seemed
to
the
hobbits
that
although
they
walked
and
stumbled
until
they
were
weary
they
were
creeping
forward
like
snails
and
getting
nowhere
each
day
the
land
looked
much
the
same
as
it
had
the
day
before
yet
steadily
the
mountains
were
drawing
nearer
south
of
rivendell
they
rose
ever
higher
and
bent
westwards
and
about
the
feet
of
the
main
range
there
was
tumbled
an
ever
wider
land
of
bleak
hills
and
deep
valleys
filled
with
turbulent
waters
paths
were
few
and
winding
and
led
them
often
only
to
the
edge
of
some
sheer
fall
or
down
into
treacherous
swamps

they
had
been
a
fortnight
on
the
way
when
the
weather
changed
the
wind
suddenly
fell
and
then
veered
round
to
the
south
the
swiftflowing
clouds
lifted
and
melted
away
and
the
sun
came
out
pale
and
bright
there
came
a
cold
clear
dawn
at
the
end
of
a
long
stumbling
nightmarch
the
travellers
reached
a
low
ridge
crowned
with
ancient
hollytrees
whose
greygreen
trunks
seemed
to
have
been
built
out
of
the
very
stone
of
the
hills
their
dark
leaves
shone
and
their
berries
glowed
red
in
the
light
of
the
rising
sun

away
in
the
south
frodo
could
see
the
dim
shapes
of
lofty
mountains
that
seemed
now
to
stand
across
the
path
that
the
company
was
taking
at
the
left
of
this
high
range
rose
three
peaks
the
tallest
and
nearest
stood
up
like
a
tooth
tipped
with
snow
its
great
bare
northern
precipice
was
still
largely
in
the
shadow
but
where
the
sunlight
slanted
upon
it
it
glowed
red

gandalf
stood
at
frodo's
side
and
looked
out
under
his
hand
we
have
done
well'
he
said
we
have
reached
the
borders
of
the
country
that
men
call
hollin
many
elves
lived
here
in
happier
days
when
eregion
was
its
name
fiveandforty
leagues
as
the
crow
flies
we
have
come
though
many
long
miles
further
our
feet
have
walked
the
land
and
the
weather
will
be
milder
now
but
perhaps
all
the
more
dangerous'

dangerous
or
not
a
real
sunrise
is
mighty
welcome'
said
frodo
throwing
back
his
hood
and
letting
the
morning
light
fall
on
his
face

'but
the
mountains
are
ahead
of
us'
said
pippin
we
must
have
turned
eastwards
in
the
night'


'no'
said
gandalf
'but
you
see
further
ahead
in
the
clear
light
beyond
those
peaks
the
range
bends
round
southwest
there
are
many
maps
in
elrond's
house
but
I
suppose
you
never
thought
to
look
at
them'

yes
I
did
sometimes'
said
pippin
but
I
don't
remember
them
frodo
has
a
better
head
for
that
sort
of
thing'

I
need
no
map'
said
gimli
who
had
come
up
with
legolas
and
was
gazing
out
before
him
with
a
strange
light
in
his
deep
eyes
there
is
the
land
where
our
fathers
worked
of
old
and
we
have
wrought
the
image
of
those
mountains
into
many
works
of
metal
and
of
stone
and
into
many
songs
and
tales
they
stand
tall
in
our
dreams
baraz
zirak
shathr

only
once
before
have
I
seen
them
from
afar
in
waking
life
but
I
know
them
and
their
names
for
under
them
lies
khazaddm
the
dwarrowdelf
that
is
now
called
the
black
pit
moria
in
the
elvish
tongue
yonder
stands
barazinbar
the
redhorn
cruel
caradhras
and
beyond
him
are
silvertine
and
cloudyhead
celebdil
the
white
and
fanuidhol
the
grey
that
we
call
zirakzigil
and
bundushathr

there
the
misty
mountains
divide
and
between
their
arms
lies
the
deepshadowed
valley
which
we
cannot
forget
azanulbizar
the
dimrill
dale
which
the
elves
call
nanduhirion'

it
is
for
the
dimrill
dale
that
we
are
making'
said
gandalf
if
we
climb
the
pass
that
is
called
the
redhorn
gate
under
the
far
side
of
caradhras
we
shall
come
down
by
the
dimrill
stair
into
the
deep
vale
of
the
dwarves
there
lies
the
mirrormere
and
there
the
river
silverlode
rises
in
its
icy
springs'

dark
is
the
water
of
kheledzram'
said
gimli
and
cold
are
the
springs
of
kibilnla
my
heart
trembles
at
the
thought
that
I
may
see
them
soon'

may
you
have
joy
of
the
sight
my
good
dwarf
l'
said
gandalf
'but
whatever
you
may
do
we
at
least
cannot
stay
in
that
valley
we
must
go
down
the
silverlode
into
the
secret
woods
and
so
to
the
great
river
and
then
'

he
paused

'yes
and
where
then'
asked
merry

'to
the
end
of
the
journey

in
the
end'
said
gandalf
'we
cannot
look
too
far
ahead
let
us
be
glad
that
the
first
stage
is
safely
over
I
think
we
will
rest
here
not
only
today
but
tonight
as
well
there
is
a
wholesome
air
about
hollin
much
evil
must
befall
a
country
before
it
wholly
forgets
the
elves
if
once
they
dwelt
there'

'that
is
true'
said
legolas
but
the
elves
of
this
land
were
of
a
race
strange
to
us
of
the
silvan
folk
and
the
trees
and
the
grass
do
not
now
remember
them
only
I
hear
the
stones
lament
them

deep
they
delved
us
fair
they
wrought
us
high
they
builded
us
but
they
are
gone

they
are
gone
they
sought
the
havens
long
ago'

that
morning
they
lit
a
fire
in
a
deep
hollow
shrouded
by
great
bushes
of
holly
and
their
supperbreakfast
was
merrier
than
it
had
been
since
they
set
out
they
did
not
hurry
to
bed
afterwards
for
they
expected
to
have
all
the
night
to
sleep
in
and
they
did
not
mean
to
go
on
again
until
the
evening
of
the
next
day
only
aragorn
was
silent
and
restless
after
a
while
he
left
the
company
and
wandered
on
to
the
ridge
there
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
looking
out
southwards
and
westwards
with
his
head
posed
as
if
he
was
listening
then
he
returned
to
the
brink
of
the
dell
and
looked
down
at
the
others
laughing
and
talking

what
is
the
matter
strider'
merry
called
up
'what
are
you
looking
for
do
you
miss
the
east
wind'

'no
indeed'
he
answered
but
I
miss
something
I
have
been
in
the
country
of
hollin
in
many
seasons
no
folk
dwell
here
now
but
many
other
creatures
live
here
at
all
times
especially
birds
yet
now
all
things
but
you
are
silent
I
can
feel
it
there
is
no
sound
for
miles
about
us
and
your
voices
seem
to
make
the
ground
echo
I
do
not
understand
it'


gandalf
looked
up
with
sudden
interest
but
what
do
you
guess
is
the
reason'
he
asked
is
there
more
in
it
than
surprise
at
seeing
four
hobbits
not
to
mention
the
rest
of
us
where
people
are
so
seldom
seen
or
heard'

I
hope
that
is
it'
answered
aragorn
but
I
have
a
sense
of
watchfulness
and
of
fear
that
I
have
never
had
here
before'

then
we
must
be
more
careful'
said
gandalf
'if
you
bring
a
ranger
with
you
it
is
well
to
pay
attention
to
him
especially
if
the
ranger
is
aragorn
we
must
stop
talking
aloud
rest
quietly
and
set
the
watch'

it
was
sam's
turn
that
day
to
take
the
first
watch
but
aragorn
joined
him
the
others
fell
asleep
then
the
silence
grew
until
even
sam
felt
it
the
breathing
of
the
sleepers
could
be
plainly
heard
the
swish
of
the
pony's
tail
and
the
occasional
movements
of
his
feet
became
loud
noises
sam
could
hear
his
own
joints
creaking
if
he
stirred
dead
silence
was
around
him
and
over
all
hung
a
clear
blue
sky
as
the
sun
rode
up
from
the
east
away
in
the
south
a
dark
patch
appeared
and
grew
and
drove
north
like
flying
smoke
in
the
wind

what's
that
strider
it
don't
look
like
a
cloud'
said
sam
in
a
whisper
to
aragorn
he
made
no
answer
he
was
gazing
intently
at
the
sky
but
before
long
sam
could
see
for
himself
what
was
approaching
flocks
of
birds
flying
at
great
speed
were
wheeling
and
circling
and
traversing
all
the
land
as
if
they
were
searching
for
something
and
they
were
steadily
drawing
nearer

lie
flat
and
still'
hissed
aragorn
pulling
sam
down
into
the
shade
of
a
hollybush
for
a
whole
regiment
of
birds
had
broken
away
suddenly
from
the
main
host
and
came
flying
low
straight
towards
the
ridge
sam
thought
they
were
a
kind
of
crow
of
large
size
as
they
passed
overhead
in
so
dense
a
throng
that
their
shadow
followed
them
darkly
over
the
ground
below
one
harsh
croak
was
heard

not
until
they
had
dwindled
into
the
distance
north
and
west
and
the
sky
was
again
clear
would
aragorn
rise
then
he
sprang
up
and
went
and
wakened
gandalf

regiments
of
black
crows
are
flying
over
all
the
land
between
the
mountains
and
the
greyflood'
he
said
and
they
have
passed
over
hollin
they
are
not
natives
here
they
are

crebain

out
of
fangorn
and
dunland
I
do
not
know
what
they
are
about
possibly
there
is
some
trouble
away
south
from
which
they
are
fleeing
but
I
think
they
are
spying
out
the
land
I
have
also
glimpsed
many
hawks
flying
high
up
in
the
sky
I
think
we
ought
to
move
again
this
evening
hollin
is
no
longer
wholesome
for
us
it
is
being
watched'

and
in
that
case
so
is
the
redhorn
gate'
said
gandalf
and
how
we
can
get
over
that
without
being
seen
I
cannot
imagine
but
we
will
think
of
that
when
we
must
as
for
moving
as
soon
as
it
is
dark
I
am
afraid
that
you
are
right'

luckily
our
fire
made
little
smoke
and
had
burned
low
before
the

crebain

came'
said
aragorn
it
must
be
put
out
and
not
lit
again'

well
if
that
isn't
a
plague
and
a
nuisance'
said
pippin
the
news
no
fire
and
a
move
again
by
night
had
been
broken
to
him
as
soon
as
he
woke
in
the
late
afternoon
'all
because
of
a
pack
of
crows
I
had
looked
forward
to
a
real
good
meal
tonight
something
hot'

well
you
can
go
on
looking
forward'
said
gandalf
there
may
be
many
unexpected
feasts
ahead
for
you
for
myself
I
should
like
a
pipe
to
smoke
in
comfort
and
warmer
feet
however
we
are
certain
of
one
thing
at
any
rate
it
will
get
warmer
as
we
get
south'

'too
warm
I
shouldn't
wonder'
muttered
sam
to
frodo
'but
i'm
beginning
to
think
it's
time
we
got
a
sight
of
that
fiery
mountain
and
saw
the
end
of
the
road
so
to
speak
I
thought
at
first
that
this
here
redhorn
or
whatever
its
name
is
might
be
it
till
gimli
spoke
his
piece
a
fair
jawcracker
dwarflanguage
must
be'
maps
conveyed
nothing
to
sam's
mind
and
all
distances
in
these
strange
lands
seemed
so
vast
that
he
was
quite
out
of
his
reckoning


all
that
day
the
company
remained
in
hiding
the
dark
birds
passed
over
now
and
again
but
as
the
westering
sun
grew
red
they
disappeared
southwards
at
dusk
the
company
set
out
and
turning
now
half
east
they
steered
their
course
towards
caradhras
which
far
away
still
glowed
faintly
red
in
the
last
light
of
the
vanished
sun
one
by
one
white
stars
sprang
forth
as
the
sky
faded

guided
by
aragorn
they
struck
a
good
path
it
looked
to
frodo
like
the
remains
of
an
ancient
road
that
had
once
been
broad
and
well
planned
from
hollin
to
the
mountainpass
the
moon
now
at
the
full
rose
over
the
mountains
and
cast
a
pale
light
in
which
the
shadows
of
stones
were
black
many
of
them
looked
to
have
been
worked
by
hands
though
now
they
lay
tumbled
and
ruinous
in
a
bleak
barren
land

it
was
the
cold
chill
hour
before
the
first
stir
of
dawn
and
the
moon
was
low
frodo
looked
up
at
the
sky
suddenly
he
saw
or
felt
a
shadow
pass
over
the
high
stars
as
if
for
a
moment
they
faded
and
then
flashed
out
again
he
shivered

did
you
see
anything
pass
over'
he
whispered
to
gandalf
who
was
just
ahead

no
but
I
felt
it
whatever
it
was'
he
answered
it
may
be
nothing
only
a
wisp
of
thin
cloud'

it
was
moving
fast
then'
muttered
aragorn
and
not
with
the
wind'

nothing
further
happened
that
night
the
next
morning
dawned
even
brighter
than
before
but
the
air
was
chill
again
already
the
wind
was
turning
back
towards
the
east
for
two
more
nights
they
marched
on
climbing
steadily
but
ever
more
slowly
as
their
road
wound
up
into
the
hills
and
the
mountains
towered
up
nearer
and
nearer
on
the
third
morning
caradhras
rose
before
them
a
mighty
peak
tipped
with
snow
like
silver
but
with
sheer
naked
sides
dull
red
as
if
stained
with
blood

there
was
a
black
look
in
the
sky
and
the
sun
was
wan
the
wind
had
gone
now
round
to
the
northeast
gandalf
snuffed
the
air
and
looked
back

winter
deepens
behind
us'
he
said
quietly
to
aragorn
'the
heights
away
north
are
whiter
than
they
were
snow
is
lying
far
down
their
shoulders
tonight
we
shall
be
on
our
way
high
up
towards
the
redhorn
gate
we
may
well
be
seen
by
watchers
on
that
narrow
path
and
waylaid
by
some
evil
but
the
weather
may
prove
a
more
deadly
enemy
than
any
what
do
you
think
of
your
course
now
aragorn'

frodo
overheard
these
words
and
understood
that
gandalf
and
aragorn
were
continuing
some
debate
that
had
begun
long
before
he
listened
anxiously

'i
think
no
good
of
our
course
from
beginning
to
end
as
you
know
well
gandalf'
answered
aragorn
and
perils
known
and
unknown
will
grow
as
we
go
on
but
we
must
go
on
and
it
is
no
good
our
delaying
the
passage
of
the
mountains
further
south
there
are
no
passes
till
one
comes
to
the
gap
of
rohan
I
do
not
trust
that
way
since
your
news
of
saruman
who
knows
which
side
now
the
marshals
of
the
horselords
serve'

'who
knows
indeed'
said
gandalf
but
there
is
another
way
and
not
by
the
pass
of
caradhras
the
dark
and
secret
way
that
we
have
spoken
of'

'but
let
us
not
speak
of
it
again
not
yet
say
nothing
to
the
others
I
beg
not
until
it
is
plain
that
there
is
no
other
way'

'we
must
decide
before
we
go
further'
answered
gandalf

'then
let
us
weigh
the
matter
in
our
minds
while
the
others
rest
and
sleep'
said
aragorn

in
the
late
afternoon
while
the
others
were
finishing
their
breakfast
gandalf
and
aragorn
went
aside
together
and
stood
looking
at
caradhras
its
sides
were
now
dark
and
sullen
and
its
head
was
in
grey
cloud
frodo
watched
them
wondering
which
way
the
debate
would
go
when
they
returned
to
the
company
gandalf
spoke
and
then
he
knew
that
it
had
been
decided
to
face
the
weather
and
the
high
pass
he
was
relieved
he
could
not
guess
what
was
the
other
dark
and
secret
way
but
the
very
mention
of
it
had
seemed
to
fill
aragorn
with
dismay
and
frodo
was
glad
that
it
had
been
abandoned


from
signs
that
we
have
seen
lately'
said
gandalf
'i
fear
that
the
redhorn
gate
may
be
watched
and
also
I
have
doubts
of
the
weather
that
is
coming
up
behind
snow
may
come
we
must
go
with
all
the
speed
that
we
can
even
so
it
will
take
us
more
than
two
marches
before
we
reach
the
top
of
the
pass
dark
will
come
early
this
evening
we
must
leave
as
soon
as
you
can
get
ready'

'i
will
add
a
word
of
advice
if
I
may'
said
boromir
'i
was
born
under
the
shadow
of
the
white
mountains
and
know
something
of
journeys
in
the
high
places
we
shall
meet
bitter
cold
if
no
worse
before
we
come
down
on
the
other
side
it
will
not
help
us
to
keep
so
secret
that
we
are
frozen
to
death
when
we
leave
here
where
there
are
still
a
few
trees
and
bushes
each
of
us
should
carry
a
faggot
of
wood
as
large
as
he
can
bear'

'and
bill
could
take
a
bit
more
couldn't
you
lad'
said
sam
the
pony
looked
at
him
mournfully

'very
well'
said
gandalf
but
we
must
not
use
the
wood

not
unless
it
is
a
choice
between
fire
and
death'

the
company
set
out
again
with
good
speed
at
first
but
soon
their
way
became
steep
and
difficult
the
twisting
and
climbing
road
had
in
many
places
almost
disappeared
and
was
blocked
with
many
fallen
stones
the
night
grew
deadly
dark
under
great
clouds
a
bitter
wind
swirled
among
the
rocks
by
midnight
they
had
climbed
to
the
knees
of
the
great
mountains
the
narrow
path
now
wound
under
a
sheer
wall
of
cliffs
to
the
left
above
which
the
grim
flanks
of
caradhras
towered
up
invisible
in
the
gloom
on
the
right
was
a
gulf
of
darkness
where
the
land
fell
suddenly
into
a
deep
ravine

laboriously
they
climbed
a
sharp
slope
and
halted
for
a
moment
at
the
top
frodo
felt
a
soft
touch
on
his
face
he
put
out
his
arm
and
saw
the
dim
white
flakes
of
snow
settling
on
his
sleeve

they
went
on
but
before
long
the
snow
was
falling
fast
filling
all
the
air
and
swirling
into
frodo's
eyes
the
dark
bent
shapes
of
gandalf
and
aragorn
only
a
pace
or
two
ahead
could
hardly
be
seen

'i
don't
like
this
at
all'
panted
sam
just
behind
'snow's
all
right
on
a
fine
morning
but
I
like
to
be
in
bed
while
it's
falling
I
wish
this
lot
would
go
off
to
hobbiton
folk
might
welcome
it
there'
except
on
the
high
moors
of
the
northfarthing
a
heavy
fall
was
rare
in
the
shire
and
was
regarded
as
a
pleasant
event
and
a
chance
for
fun
no
living
hobbit
save
bilbo
could
remember
the
fell
winter
of
1311
when
the
white
wolves
invaded
the
shire
over
the
frozen
brandywine

gandalf
halted
snow
was
thick
on
his
hood
and
shoulders
it
was
already
ankledeep
about
his
boots

this
is
what
I
feared'
he
said
what
do
you
say
now
aragorn'

'that
I
feared
it
too'
aragorn
answered
but
less
than
other
things
I
knew
the
risk
of
snow
though
it
seldom
falls
heavily
so
far
south
save
high
up
in
the
mountains
but
we
are
not
high
yet
we
are
still
far
down
where
the
paths
are
usually
open
all
the
winter'

'i
wonder
if
this
is
a
contrivance
of
the
enemy'
said
boromir
they
say
in
my
land
that
he
can
govern
the
storms
in
the
mountains
of
shadow
that
stand
upon
the
borders
of
mordor
he
has
strange
powers
and
many
allies'

'his
arm
has
grown
long
indeed'
said
gimli
if
he
can
draw
snow
down
from
the
north
to
trouble
us
here
three
hundred
leagues
away'

'his
arm
has
grown
long'
said
gandalf

while
they
were
halted
the
wind
died
down
and
the
snow
slackened
until
it
almost
ceased
they
tramped
on
again
but
they
had
not
gone
more
than
a
furlong
when
the
storm
returned
with
fresh
fury
the
wind
whistled
and
the
snow
became
a
blinding
blizzard
soon
even
boromir
found
it
hard
to
keep
going
the
hobbits
bent
nearly
double
toiled
along
behind
the
taller
folk
but
it
was
plain
that
they
could
not
go
much
further
if
the
snow
continued
frodo's
feet
felt
like
lead
pippin
was
dragging
behind
even
gimli
as
stout
as
any
dwarf
could
be
was
grumbling
as
he
trudged

the
company
halted
suddenly
as
if
they
had
come
to
an
agreement
without
any
words
being
spoken
they
heard
eerie
noises
in
the
darkness
round
them
it
may
have
been
only
a
trick
of
the
wind
in
the
cracks
and
gullies
of
the
rocky
wall
but
the
sounds
were
those
of
shrill
cries
and
wild
howls
of
laughter
stones
began
to
fall
from
the
mountainside
whistling
over
their
heads
or
crashing
on
the
path
beside
them
every
now
and
again
they
heard
a
dull
rumble
as
a
great
boulder
rolled
down
from
hidden
heights
above

we
cannot
go
further
tonight'
said
boromir
let
those
call
it
the
wind
who
will
there
are
fell
voices
on
the
air
and
these
stones
are
aimed
at
us'

I
do
call
it
the
wind'
said
aragorn
but
that
does
not
make
what
you
say
untrue
there
are
many
evil
and
unfriendly
things
in
the
world
that
have
little
love
for
those
that
go
on
two
legs
and
yet
are
not
in
league
with
sauron
but
have
purposes
of
their
own
some
have
been
in
this
world
longer
than
he'

'caradhras
was
called
the
cruel
and
had
an
ill
name
said
gimli
long
years
ago
when
rumour
of
sauron
had
not
been
heard
in
these
lands'

it
matters
little
who
is
the
enemy
if
we
cannot
beat
off
his
attack
said
gandalf

'but
what
can
we
do'
cried
pippin
miserably
he
was
leaning
on
merry
and
frodo
and
he
was
shivering

either
stop
where
we
are
or
go
back'
said
gandalf
'it
is
no
good
going
on
only
a
little
higher
if
I
remember
rightly
this
path
leaves
the
cliff
and
runs
into
a
wide
shallow
trough
at
the
bottom
of
a
long
hard
slope
we
should
have
no
shelter
there
from
snow
or
stones

or
anything
else'

and
it
is
no
good
going
back
while
the
storm
holds'
said
aragorn
we
have
passed
no
place
on
the
way
up
that
offered
more
shelter
than
this
cliffwall
we
are
under
now'

shelter'
muttered
sam
if
this
is
shelter
then
one
wall
and
no
roof
make
a
house'

the
company
now
gathered
together
as
close
to
the
cliff
as
they
could
it
faced
southwards
and
near
the
bottom
it
leaned
out
a
little
so
that
they
hoped
it
would
give
them
some
protection
from
the
northerly
wind
and
from
the
falling
stones
but
eddying
blasts
swirled
round
them
from
every
side
and
the
snow
flowed
down
in
ever
denser
clouds

they
huddled
together
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
bill
the
pony
stood
patiently
but
dejectedly
in
front
of
the
hobbits
and
screened
them
a
little
but
before
long
the
drifting
snow
was
above
his
hocks
and
it
went
on
mounting
if
they
had
had
no
larger
companions
the
hobbits
would
soon
have
been
entirely
buried

a
great
sleepiness
came
over
frodo
he
felt
himself
sinking
fast
into
a
warm
and
hazy
dream
he
thought
a
fire
was
heating
his
toes
and
out
of
the
shadows
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
he
heard
bilbo's
voice
speaking

I
don't
think
much
of
your
diary

he
said

snowstorms
on
january
the
twelfth
there
was
no
need
to
come
back
to
report
that



but
I
wanted
rest
and
sleep
bilbo

frodo
answered
with
an
effort
when
he
felt
himself
shaken
and
he
came
back
painfully
to
wakefulness
boromir
had
lifted
him
off
the
ground
out
of
a
nest
of
snow

this
will
be
the
death
of
the
halflings
gandalf'
said
boromir
it
is
useless
to
sit
here
until
the
snow
goes
over
our
heads
we
must
do
something
to
save
ourselves'

give
them
this'
said
gandalf
searching
in
his
pack
and
drawing
out
a
leathern
flask
just
a
mouthful
each

for
all
of
us
it
is
very
precious
it
is

miruvor

the
cordial
of
imladris
elrond
gave
it
to
me
at
our
parting
pass
it
round'

as
soon
as
frodo
had
swallowed
a
little
of
the
warm
and
fragrant
liquor
he
felt
a
new
strength
of
heart
and
the
heavy
drowsiness
left
his
limbs
the
others
also
revived
and
found
fresh
hope
and
vigour
but
the
snow
did
not
relent
it
whirled
about
them
thicker
than
ever
and
the
wind
blew
louder


'what
do
you
say
to
fire'
asked
boromir
suddenly
'the
choice
seems
near
now
between
fire
and
death
gandalf
doubtless
we
shall
be
hidden
from
all
unfriendly
eyes
when
the
snow
has
covered
us
but
that
will
not
help
us'

'you
may
make
a
fire
if
you
can'
answered
gandalf
'if
there
are
any
watchers
that
can
endure
this
storm
then
they
can
see
us
fire
or
no'
but
though
they
had
brought
wood
and
kindlings
by
the
advice
of
boromir
it
passed
the
skill
of
elf
or
even
dwarf
to
strike
a
flame
that
would
hold
amid
the
swirling
wind
or
catch
in
the
wet
fuel
at
last
reluctantly
gandalf
himself
took
a
hand
picking
up
a
faggot
he
held
it
aloft
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
word
of
command

naur
an
edraith
ammen

he
thrust
the
end
of
his
staff
into
the
midst
of
it
at
once
a
great
spout
of
green
and
blue
flame
sprang
out
and
the
wood
flared
and
sputtered

if
there
are
any
to
see
then
I
at
least
am
revealed
to
them'
he
said
'i
have
written

gandalf
is
here

in
signs
that
all
can
read
from
rivendell
to
the
mouths
of
anduin'

but
the
company
cared
no
longer
for
watchers
or
unfriendly
eyes
their
hearts
were
rejoiced
to
see
the
light
of
the
fire
the
wood
burned
merrily
and
though
all
round
it
the
snow
hissed
and
pools
of
slush
crept
under
their
feet
they
warmed
their
hands
gladly
at
the
blaze
there
they
stood
stooping
in
a
circle
round
the
little
dancing
and
blowing
flames
a
red
light
was
on
their
tired
and
anxious
faces
behind
them
the
night
was
like
a
black
wall

but
the
wood
was
burning
fast
and
the
snow
still
fell

the
fire
burned
low
and
the
last
faggot
was
thrown
on

the
night
is
getting
old'
said
aragorn
the
dawn
is
not
far
off'

if
any
dawn
can
pierce
these
clouds'
said
gimli

boromir
stepped
out
of
the
circle
and
stared
up
into
the
blackness
'the
snow
is
growing
less'
he
said
and
the
wind
is
quieter'

frodo
gazed
wearily
at
the
flakes
still
falling
out
of
the
dark
to
be
revealed
white
for
a
moment
in
the
light
of
the
dying
fire
but
for
a
long
time
he
could
see
no
sign
of
their
slackening
then
suddenly
as
sleep
was
beginning
to
creep
over
him
again
he
was
aware
that
the
wind
had
indeed
fallen
and
the
flakes
were
becoming
larger
and
fewer
very
slowly
a
dim
light
began
to
grow
at
last
the
snow
stopped
altogether

as
the
light
grew
stronger
it
showed
a
silent
shrouded
world
below
their
refuge
were
white
humps
and
domes
and
shapeless
deeps
beneath
which
the
path
that
they
had
trodden
was
altogether
lost
but
the
heights
above
were
hidden
in
great
clouds
still
heavy
with
the
threat
of
snow

gimli
looked
up
and
shook
his
head
caradhras
has
not
forgiven
us'
he
said
he
has
more
snow
yet
to
fling
at
us
if
we
go
on
the
sooner
we
go
back
and
down
the
better'

to
this
all
agreed
but
their
retreat
was
now
difficult
it
might
well
prove
impossible
only
a
few
paces
from
the
ashes
of
their
fire
the
snow
lay
many
feet
deep
higher
than
the
heads
of
the
hobbits
in
places
it
had
been
scooped
and
piled
by
the
wind
into
great
drifts
against
the
cliff

if
gandalf
would
go
before
us
with
a
bright
flame
he
might
melt
a
path
for
you'
said
legolas
the
storm
had
troubled
him
little
and
he
alone
of
the
company
remained
still
light
of
heart

if
elves
could
fly
over
mountains
they
might
fetch
the
sun
to
save
us'
answered
gandalf
but
I
must
have
something
to
work
on
I
cannot
burn
snow'

well'
said
boromir
when
heads
are
at
a
loss
bodies
must
serve
as
we
say
in
my
country
the
strongest
of
us
must
seek
a
way
see
though
all
is
now
snowclad
our
path
as
we
came
up
turned
about
that
shoulder
of
rock
down
yonder
it
was
there
that
the
snow
first
began
to
burden
us
if
we
could
reach
that
point
maybe
it
would
prove
easier
beyond
it
is
no
more
than
a
furlong
off
I
guess'

then
let
us
force
a
path
thither
you
and
i'
said
aragorn

aragorn
was
the
tallest
of
the
company
but
boromir
little
less
in
height
was
broader
and
heavier
in
build
he
led
the
way
and
aragorn
followed
him
slowly
they
moved
off
and
were
soon
toiling
heavily
in
places
the
snow
was
breasthigh
and
often
boromir
seemed
to
bc
swimming
or
burrowing
with
his
great
arms
rather
than
walking

legolas
watched
them
for
a
while
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
then
he
turned
to
the
others
the
strongest
must
seek
a
way
say
you
but
I
say
let
a
ploughman
plough
but
choose
an
otter
for
swimming
and
for
running
light
over
grass
and
leaf
or
over
snowan
elf'

with
that
he
sprang
forth
nimbly
and
then
frodo
noticed
as
if
for
the
first
time
though
he
had
long
known
it
that
the
elf
had
no
boots
but
wore
only
light
shoes
as
he
always
did
and
his
feet
made
little
imprint
in
the
snow

'farewell'
he
said
to
gandalf
I
go
to
find
the
sun'
then
swift
as
a
runner
over
firm
sand
he
shot
away
and
quickly
overtaking
the
toiling
men
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
passed
them
and
sped
into
the
distance
and
vanished
round
the
rocky
turn

the
others
waited
huddled
together
watching
until
boromir
and
aragorn
dwindled
into
black
specks
in
the
whiteness
at
length
they
too
passed
from
sight
the
time
dragged
on
the
clouds
lowered
and
now
a
few
flakes
of
snow
came
curling
down
again

an
hour
maybe
went
by
though
it
seemed
far
longer
and
then
at
last
they
saw
legolas
coming
back
at
the
same
time
boromir
and
aragorn
reappeared
round
the
bend
far
behind
him
and
came
labouring
up
the
slope

well'
cried
legolas
as
he
ran
up
I
have
not
brought
the
sun
she
is
walking
in
the
blue
fields
of
the
south
and
a
little
wreath
of
snow
on
this
redhorn
hillock
troubles
her
not
at
all
but
I
have
brought
back
a
gleam
of
good
hope
for
those
who
are
doomed
to
go
on
feet
there
is
the
greatest
winddrift
of
all
just
beyond
the
turn
and
there
our
strong
men
were
almost
buried
they
despaired
until
I
returned
and
told
them
that
the
drift
was
little
wider
than
a
wall
and
on
the
other
side
the
snow
suddenly
grows
less
while
further
down
it
is
no
more
than
a
white
coverlet
to
cool
a
hobbit's
toes'

ah
it
is
as
I
said'
growled
gimli
'it
was
no
ordinary
storm
it
is
the
ill
will
of
caradhras
he
does
not
love
elves
and
dwarves
and
that
drift
was
laid
to
cut
off
our
escape'

'but
happily
your
caradhras
has
forgotten
that
you
have
men
with
you'
said
boromir
who
came
up
at
that
moment
and
doughty
men
too
if
I
may
say
it
though
lesser
men
with
spades
might
have
served
you
better
still
we
have
thrust
a
lane
through
the
drift
and
for
that
all
here
may
be
grateful
who
cannot
run
as
light
as
elves'

but
how
are
we
to
get
down
there
even
if
you
have
cut
through
the
drift'
said
pippin
voicing
the
thought
of
all
the
hobbits

'have
hope'
said
boromir
'i
am
weary
but
I
still
have
some
strength
left
and
aragorn
too
we
will
bear
the
little
folk
the
others
no
doubt
will
make
shift
to
tread
the
path
behind
us
come
master
peregrin
I
will
begin
with
you'

he
lifted
up
the
hobbit
'cling
to
my
back
I
shall
need
my
arms'
he
said
and
strode
forward
aragorn
with
merry
came
behind
pippin
marvelled
at
his
strength
seeing
the
passage
that
he
had
already
forced
with
no
other
tool
than
his
great
limbs
even
now
burdened
as
he
was
he
was
widening
the
track
for
those
who
followed
thrusting
the
snow
aside
as
he
went

they
came
at
length
to
the
great
drift
it
was
flung
across
the
mountainpath
like
a
sheer
and
sudden
wall
and
its
crest
sharp
as
if
shaped
with
knives
reared
up
more
than
twice
the
height
of
boromir
but
through
the
middle
a
passage
had
been
beaten
rising
and
falling
like
a
bridge
on
the
far
side
merry
and
pippin
were
set
down
and
there
they
waited
with
legolas
for
the
rest
of
the
company
to
arrive

after
a
while
boromir
returned
carrying
sam
behind
in
the
narrow
but
now
welltrodden
track
came
gandalf
leading
bill
with
gimli
perched
among
the
baggage
last
came
aragorn
carrying
frodo
they
passed
through
the
lane
but
hardly
had
frodo
touched
the
ground
when
with
a
deep
rumble
there
rolled
down
a
fall
of
stones
and
slithering
snow
the
spray
of
it
half
blinded
the
company
as
they
crouched
against
the
cliff
and
when
the
air
cleared
again
they
saw
that
the
path
was
blocked
behind
them

enough
enough'
cried
gimli
'we
are
departing
as
quickly
as
we
may'
and
indeed
with
that
last
stroke
the
malice
of
the
mountain
seemed
to
be
expended
as
if
caradhras
was
satisfied
that
the
invaders
had
been
beaten
off
and
would
not
dare
to
return
the
threat
of
snow
lifted
the
clouds
began
to
break
and
the
light
grew
broader

as
legolas
had
reported
they
found
that
the
snow
became
steadily
more
shallow
as
they
went
down
so
that
even
the
hobbits
could
trudge
along
soon
they
all
stood
once
more
on
the
flat
shelf
at
the
head
of
the
steep
slope
where
they
had
felt
the
first
flakes
of
snow
the
night
before

the
morning
was
now
far
advanced
from
the
high
place
they
looked
back
westwards
over
the
lower
lands
far
away
in
the
tumble
of
country
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
was
the
dell
from
which
they
had
started
to
climb
the
pass

frodo's
legs
ached
he
was
chilled
to
the
bone
and
hungry
and
his
head
was
dizzy
as
he
thought
of
the
long
and
painful
march
downhill
black
specks
swam
before
his
eyes
he
rubbed
them
but
the
black
specks
remained
in
the
distance
below
him
but
still
high
above
the
lower
foothills
dark
dots
were
circling
in
the
air

the
birds
again'
said
aragorn
pointing
down

'that
cannot
be
helped
now'
said
gandalf
whether
they
are
good
or
evil
or
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
at
all
we
must
go
down
at
once
not
even
on
the
knees
of
caradhras
will
we
wait
for
another
nightfall'

a
cold
wind
flowed
down
behind
them
as
they
turned
their
backs
on
the
redhorn
gate
and
stumbled
wearily
down
the
slope
caradhras
had
defeated
them


chapter
4


a
journey
in
the
dark


it
was
evening
and
the
grey
light
was
again
waning
fast
when
they
halted
for
the
night
they
were
very
weary
the
mountains
were
veiled
in
deepening
dusk
and
the
wind
was
cold
gandalf
spared
them
one
more
mouthful
each
of
the
miruvor
of
rivendell
when
they
had
eaten
some
food
he
called
a
council

'we
cannot
of
course
go
on
again
tonight'
he
said
the
attack
on
the
redhorn
gate
has
tired
us
out
and
we
must
rest
here
for
a
while'

and
then
where
are
we
to
go
'
asked
frodo

'we
still
have
our
journey
and
our
errand
before
us'
answered
gandalf
we
have
no
choice
but
to
go
on
or
to
return
to
rivendell'

pippin's
face
brightened
visibly
at
the
mere
mention
of
return
to
rivendell
merry
and
sam
looked
up
hopefully
but
aragorn
and
boromir
made
no
sign
frodo
looked
troubled

I
wish
I
was
back
there'
he
said
but
how
can
I
return
without
shame

unless
there
is
indeed
no
other
way
and
we
are
already
defeated
'

you
are
right
frodo'
said
gandalf
to
go
back
is
to
admit
defeat
and
face
worse
defeat
to
come
if
we
go
back
now
then
the
ring
must
remain
there
we
shall
not
be
able
to
set
out
again
then
sooner
or
later
rivendell
will
be
besieged
and
after
a
brief
and
bitter
time
it
will
be
destroyed
the
ringwraiths
are
deadly
enemies
but
they
are
only
shadows
yet
of
the
power
and
terror
they
would
possess
if
the
ruling
ring
was
on
their
master's
hand
again'

'then
we
must
go
on
if
there
is
a
way'
said
frodo
with
a
sigh
sam
sank
back
into
gloom

there
is
a
way
that
we
may
attempt'
said
gandalf
I
thought
from
the
beginning
when
first
I
considered
this
journey
that
we
should
try
it
but
it
is
not
a
pleasant
way
and
I
have
not
spoken
of
it
to
the
company
before
aragorn
was
against
it
until
the
pass
over
the
mountains
had
at
least
been
tried'


if
it
is
a
worse
road
than
the
redhorn
gate
then
it
must
be
evil
indeed'
said
merry
but
you
had
better
tell
us
about
it
and
let
us
know
the
worst
at
once'

'the
road
that
I
speak
of
leads
to
the
mines
of
moria'
said
gandalf
only
gimli
lifted
up
his
head
a
smouldering
fire
was
in
his
eyes
on
all
the
others
a
dread
fell
at
the
mention
of
that
name
even
to
the
hobbits
it
was
a
legend
of
vague
fear

the
road
may
lead
to
moria
but
how
can
we
hope
that
it
will
lead
through
moria
'
said
aragorn
darkly

it
is
a
name
of
ill
omen'
said
boromir
nor
do
I
see
the
need
to
go
there
if
we
cannot
cross
the
mountains
let
us
journey
southwards
until
we
come
to
the
gap
of
rohan
where
men
are
friendly
to
my
people
taking
the
road
that
I
followed
on
my
way
hither
or
we
might
pass
by
and
cross
the
isen
into
langstrand
and
lebennin
and
so
come
to
gondor
from
the
regions
nigh
to
the
sea'

'things
have
changed
since
you
came
north
boromir'
answered
gandalf
'did
you
not
hear
what
I
told
you
of
saruman
with
him
I
may
have
business
of
my
own
ere
all
is
over
but
the
ring
must
not
come
near
isengard
if
that
can
by
any
means
be
prevented
the
gap
of
rohan
is
closed
to
us
while
we
go
with
the
bearer

'as
for
the
longer
road
we
cannot
afford
the
time
we
might
spend
a
year
in
such
a
journey
and
we
should
pass
through
many
lands
that
are
empty
and
harbourless
yet
they
would
not
be
safe
the
watchful
eyes
both
of
saruman
and
of
the
enemy
are
on
them
when
you
came
north
boromir
you
were
in
the
enemy's
eyes
only
one
stray
wanderer
from
the
south
and
a
matter
of
small
concern
to
him
his
mind
was
busy
with
the
pursuit
of
the
ring
but
you
return
now
as
a
member
of
the
ring's
company
and
you
are
in
peril
as
long
as
you
remain
with
us
the
danger
will
increase
with
every
league
that
we
go
south
under
the
naked
sky

since
our
open
attempt
on
the
mountainpass
our
plight
has
become
more
desperate
I
fear
I
see
now
little
hope
if
we
do
not
soon
vanish
from
sight
for
a
while
and
cover
our
trail
therefore
I
advise
that
we
should
go
neither
over
the
mountains
nor
round
them
but
under
them
that
is
a
road
at
any
rate
that
the
enemy
will
least
expect
us
to
take'

we
do
not
know
what
he
expects'
said
boromir
he
may
watch
all
roads
likely
and
unlikely
in
that
case
to
enter
moria
would
be
to
walk
into
a
trap
hardly
better
than
knocking
at
the
gates
of
the
dark
tower
itself
the
name
of
moria
is
black'

you
speak
of
what
you
do
not
know
when
you
liken
moria
to
the
stronghold
of
sauron'
answered
gandalf
I
alone
of
you
have
ever
been
in
the
dungeons
of
the
dark
lord
and
only
in
his
older
and
lesser
dwelling
in
dol
guldur
those
who
pass
the
gates
of
baraddr
do
not
return
but
I
would
not
lead
you
into
moria
if
there
were
no
hope
of
coming
out
again
if
there
are
orcs
there
it
may
prove
ill
for
us
that
is
true
but
most
of
the
orcs
of
the
misty
mountains
were
scattered
or
destroyed
in
the
battle
of
five
armies
the
eagles
report
that
orcs
are
gathering
again
from
afar
but
there
is
a
hope
that
moria
is
still
free

there
is
even
a
chance
that
dwarves
are
there
and
that
in
some
deep
hall
of
his
fathers
balin
son
of
fundin
may
be
found
however
it
may
prove
one
must
tread
the
path
that
need
chooses'

'i
will
tread
the
path
with
you
gandalf
'
said
gimli
'i
will
go
and
look
on
the
halls
of
durin
whatever
may
wait
thereif
you
can
find
the
doors
that
are
shut'

'good
gimli
'
said
gandalf
you
encourage
me
we
will
seek
the
hidden
doors
together
and
we
will
come
through
in
the
ruins
of
the
dwarves
a
dwarf's
head
will
be
less
easy
to
bewilder
than
elves
or
men
or
hobbits
yet
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
I
have
been
to
moria
I
sought
there
long
for
thrin
son
of
thrr
after
he
was
lost
I
passed
through
and
I
came
out
again
alive
'

I
too
once
passed
the
dimrill
gate'
said
aragorn
quietly
'but
though
I
also
came
out
again
the
memory
is
very
evil
I
do
not
wish
to
enter
moria
a
second
time'

'and
I
don't
wish
to
enter
it
even
once'
said
pippin

'nor
me'
muttered
sam

of
course
not
'
said
gandalf
'who
would
but
the
question
is
who
will
follow
me
if
I
lead
you
there
'


'i
will'
said
gimli
eagerly

'i
will'
said
aragorn
heavily
you
followed
my
lead
almost
to
disaster
in
the
snow
and
have
said
no
word
of
blame
I
will
follow
your
lead
now

if
this
last
warning
does
not
move
you
it
is
not
of
the
ring
nor
of
us
others
that
I
am
thinking
now
but
of
you
gandalf
and
I
say
to
you
if
you
pass
the
doors
of
moria
beware
'

I
will

not

go'
said
boromir
'not
unless
the
vote
of
the
whole
company
is
against
me
what
do
legolas
and
the
little
folk
say
the
ringbearer's
voice
surely
should
be
heard
'

'i
do
not
wish
to
go
to
moria'
said
legolas

the
hobbits
said
nothing
sam
looked
at
frodo
at
last
frodo
spoke
I
do
not
wish
to
go'
he
said
but
neither
do
I
wish
to
refuse
the
advice
of
gandalf
I
beg
that
there
should
be
no
vote
until
we
have
slept
on
it
gandalf
will
get
votes
easier
in
the
light
of
the
morning
than
in
this
cold
gloom
how
the
wind
howls
'

at
these
words
all
fell
into
silent
thought
they
heard
the
wind
hissing
among
the
rocks
and
trees
and
there
was
a
howling
and
wailing
round
them
in
the
empty
spaces
of
the
night

suddenly
aragorn
leapt
to
his
feet
'how
the
wind
howls
'
he
cried
'it
is
howling
with
wolfvoices
the
wargs
have
come
west
of
the
mountains
'

'need
we
wait
until
morning
then
'
said
gandalf
it
is
as
I
said
the
hunt
is
up
even
if
we
live
to
see
the
dawn
who
now
will
wish
to
journey
south
by
night
with
the
wild
wolves
on
his
trail
'

'how
far
is
moria
'
asked
boromir

there
was
a
door
southwest
of
caradhras
some
fifteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
and
maybe
twenty
as
the
wolf
runs'
answered
gandalf
grimly

'then
let
us
start
as
soon
as
it
is
light
tomorrow
if
we
can'
said
boromir
'the
wolf
that
one
hears
is
worse
than
the
orc
that
one
fears'

true'
said
aragorn
loosening
his
sword
in
its
sheath
but
where
the
warg
howls
there
also
the
orc
prowls'

I
wish
I
had
taken
elrond's
advice'
muttered
pippin
to
sam
I
am
no
good
after
all
there
is
not
enough
of
the
breed
of
bandobras
the
bullroarer
in
me
these
howls
freeze
my
blood
I
don't
ever
remember
feeling
so
wretched'

'my
heart's
right
down
in
my
toes
mr
pippin'
said
sam
'but
we
aren't
etten
yet
and
there
are
some
stout
folk
here
with
us
whatever
may
be
in
store
for
old
gandalf
i'll
wager
it
isn't
a
wolf's
belly'

for
their
defence
in
the
night
the
company
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
small
hill
under
which
they
had
been
sheltering
it
was
crowned
with
a
knot
of
old
and
twisted
trees
about
which
lay
a
broken
circle
of
boulder
stones
in
the
midst
of
this
they
lit
a
fire
for
there
was
no
hope
that
darkness
and
silence
would
keep
their
trail
from
discovery
by
the
hunting
packs

round
the
fire
they
sat
and
those
that
were
not
on
guard
dozed
uneasily
poor
bill
the
pony
trembled
and
sweated
where
he
stood
the
howling
of
the
wolves
was
now
all
round
them
sometimes
nearer
and
sometimes
further
off
in
the
dead
of
the
night
many
shining
eyes
were
seen
peering
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
some
advanced
almost
to
the
ring
of
stones
at
a
gap
in
the
circle
a
great
dark
wolfshape
could
be
seen
halted
gazing
at
them
a
shuddering
howl
broke
from
him
as
if
he
were
a
captain
summoning
his
pack
to
the
assault

gandalf
stood
up
and
strode
forward
holding
his
staff
aloft
'listen
hound
of
sauron
'
he
cried
gandalf
is
here
fly
if
you
value
your
foul
skin
I
will
shrivel
you
from
tail
to
snout
if
you
come
within
this
ring'

the
wolf
snarled
and
sprang
towards
them
with
a
great
leap
at
that
moment
there
was
a
sharp
twang
legolas
had
loosed
his
bow
there
was
a
hideous
yell
and
the
leaping
shape
thudded
to
the
ground
the
elvish
arrow
had
pierced
its
throat
the
watching
eyes
were
suddenly
extinguished
gandalf
and
aragorn
strode
forward
but
the
hill
was
deserted
the
hunting
packs
had
fled
all
about
them
the
darkness
grew
silent
and
no
cry
came
on
the
sighing
wind


the
night
was
old
and
westward
the
waning
moon
was
setting
gleaming
fitfully
through
the
breaking
clouds
suddenly
frodo
started
from
sleep
without
warning
a
storm
of
howls
broke
out
fierce
and
wild
all
about
the
camp
a
great
host
of
wargs
had
gathered
silently
and
was
now
attacking
them
from
every
side
at
once

fling
fuel
on
the
fire'
cried
gandalf
to
the
hobbits
draw
your
blades
and
stand
back
to
back'

in
the
leaping
light
as
the
fresh
wood
blazed
up
frodo
saw
many
grey
shapes
spring
over
the
ring
of
stones
more
and
more
followed
through
the
throat
of
one
huge
leader
aragorn
passed
his
sword
with
a
thrust
with
a
great
sweep
boromir
hewed
the
head
off
another
beside
them
gimli
stood
with
his
stout
legs
apart
wielding
his
dwarfaxe
the
bow
of
legolas
was
singing

in
the
wavering
firelight
gandalf
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
he
rose
up
a
great
menacing
shape
like
the
monument
of
some
ancient
king
of
stone
set
upon
a
hill
stooping
like
a
cloud
he
lifted
a
burning
branch
and
strode
to
meet
the
wolves
they
gave
back
before
him
high
in
the
air
he
tossed
the
blazing
brand
it
flared
with
a
sudden
white
radiance
like
lightning
and
his
voice
rolled
like
thunder


naur
an
edraith
ammen
naur
dan
I
ngaurhoth
'
he
cried

there
was
a
roar
and
a
crackle
and
the
tree
above
him
burst
into
a
leaf
and
bloom
of
blinding
flame
the
fire
leapt
from
treetop
to
treetop
the
whole
hill
was
crowned
with
dazzling
light
the
swords
and
knives
of
the
defenders
shone
and
flickered
the
last
arrow
of
legolas
kindled
in
the
air
as
it
flew
and
plunged
burning
into
the
heart
of
a
great
wolfchieftain
all
the
others
fled

slowly
the
fire
died
till
nothing
was
left
but
falling
ash
and
sparks
a
bitter
smoke
curled
above
the
burned
treestumps
and
blew
darkly
from
the
hill
as
the
first
light
of
dawn
came
dimly
in
the
sky
their
enemies
were
routed
and
did
not
return

what
did
I
tell
you
mr
pippin
'
said
sam
shething
his
sword
wolves
won't
get
him
that
was
an
eyeopener
and
no
mistake
nearly
singed
the
hair
off
my
head'

when
the
full
light
of
the
morning
came
no
signs
of
the
wolves
were
to
be
found
and
they
looked
in
vain
for
the
bodies
of
the
dead
no
trace
of
the
fight
remained
but
the
charred
trees
and
the
arrows
of
legolas
lying
on
the
hilltop
all
were
undamaged
save
one
of
which
only
the
point
was
left

it
is
as
I
feared'
said
gandalf
these
were
no
ordinary
wolves
hunting
for
food
in
the
wilderness
let
us
eat
quickly
and
go'

that
day
the
weather
changed
again
almost
as
if
it
was
at
the
command
of
some
power
that
had
no
longer
any
use
for
snow
since
they
had
retreated
from
the
pass
a
power
that
wished
now
to
have
a
clear
light
in
which
things
that
moved
in
the
wild
could
be
seen
from
far
away
the
wind
had
been
turning
through
north
to
northwest
during
the
night
and
now
it
failed
the
clouds
vanished
southwards
and
the
sky
was
opened
high
and
blue
as
they
stood
upon
the
hillside
ready
to
depart
a
pale
sunlight
gleamed
over
the
mountaintops

we
must
reach
the
doors
before
sunset'
said
gandalf
'or
I
fear
we
shall
not
reach
them
at
all
it
is
not
far
but
our
path
may
be
winding
for
here
aragorn
cannot
guide
us
he
has
seldom
walked
in
this
country
and
only
once
have
I
been
under
the
west
wall
of
moria
and
that
was
long
ago

there
it
lies'
he
said
pointing
away
southeastwards
to
where
the
mountains'
sides
fell
sheer
into
the
shadows
at
their
feet
in
the
distance
could
be
dimly
seen
a
line
of
bare
cliffs
and
in
their
midst
taller
than
the
rest
one
great
grey
wall
when
we
left
the
pass
I
led
you
southwards
and
not
back
to
our
starting
point
as
some
of
you
may
have
noticed
it
is
well
that
I
did
so
for
now
we
have
several
miles
less
to
cross
and
haste
is
needed
let
us
go
'

I
do
not
know
which
to
hope'
said
boromir
grimly
that
gandalf
will
find
what
he
seeks
or
that
coming
to
the
cliff
we
shall
find
the
gates
lost
for
ever
all
choices
seem
ill
and
to
be
caught
between
wolves
and
the
wall
the
likeliest
chance
lead
on'

gimli
now
walked
ahead
by
the
wizard's
side
so
eager
was
he
to
come
to
moria
together
they
led
the
company
back
towards
the
mountains
the
only
road
of
old
to
moria
from
the
west
had
lain
along
the
course
of
a
stream
the
sirannon
that
ran
out
from
the
feet
of
the
cliffs
near
where
the
doors
had
stood
but
either
gandalf
was
astray
or
else
the
land
had
changed
in
recent
years
for
he
did
not
strike
the
stream
where
he
looked
to
find
it
only
a
few
miles
southwards
from
their
start

the
morning
was
passing
towards
noon
and
still
the
company
wandered
and
scrambled
in
a
barren
country
of
red
stones
nowhere
could
they
see
any
gleam
of
water
or
hear
any
sound
of
it
all
was
bleak
and
dry
their
hearts
sank
they
saw
no
living
thing
and
not
a
bird
was
in
the
sky
but
what
the
night
would
bring
if
it
caught
them
in
that
lost
land
none
of
them
cared
to
think

suddenly
gimli
who
had
pressed
on
ahead
called
back
to
them
he
was
standing
on
a
knoll
and
pointing
to
the
right
hurrying
up
they
saw
below
them
a
deep
and
narrow
channel
it
was
empty
and
silent
and
hardly
a
trickle
of
water
flowed
among
the
brown
and
redstained
stones
of
its
bed
but
on
the
near
side
there
was
a
path
much
broken
and
decayed
that
wound
its
way
among
the
ruined
walls
and
pavingstones
of
an
ancient
highroad

'ah
here
it
is
at
last
'
said
gandalf
this
is
where
the
stream
ran
sirannon
the
gatestream
they
used
to
call
it
but
what
has
happened
to
the
water
I
cannot
guess
it
used
to
be
swift
and
noisy
come
we
must
hurry
on
we
are
late'

the
company
were
footsore
and
tired
but
they
trudged
doggedly
along
the
rough
and
winding
track
for
many
miles
the
sun
turned
from
the
noon
and
began
to
go
west
after
a
brief
halt
and
a
hasty
meal
they
went
on
again
before
them
the
mountains
frowned
but
their
path
lay
in
a
deep
trough
of
land
and
they
could
see
only
the
higher
shoulders
and
the
far
eastward
peaks

at
length
they
came
to
a
sharp
bend
there
the
road
which
had
been
veering
southwards
between
the
brink
of
the
channel
and
a
steep
fall
of
the
land
to
the
left
turned
and
went
due
east
again
rounding
the
corner
they
saw
before
them
a
low
cliff
some
five
fathoms
high
with
a
broken
and
jagged
top
over
it
a
trickling
water
dripped
through
a
wide
cleft
that
seemed
to
have
been
carved
out
by
a
fall
that
had
once
been
strong
and
full

indeed
things
have
changed
'
said
gandalf
but
there
is
no
mistaking
the
place
there
is
all
that
remains
of
the
stair
falls
if
I
remember
right
there
was
a
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
rock
at
their
side
but
the
main
road
wound
away
left
and
climbed
with
several
loops
up
to
the
level
ground
at
the
top
there
used
to
be
a
shallow
valley
beyond
the
falls
right
up
to
the
walls
of
moria
and
the
sirannon
flowed
through
it
with
the
road
beside
it
let
us
go
and
see
what
things
are
like
now
'

they
found
the
stone
steps
without
difficulty
and
gimli
sprang
swiftly
up
them
followed
by
gandalf
and
frodo
when
they
reached
the
top
they
saw
that
they
could
go
no
further
that
way
and
the
reason
for
the
drying
up
of
the
gatestream
was
revealed
behind
them
the
sinking
sun
filled
the
cool
western
sky
with
glimmering
gold
before
them
stretched
a
dark
still
lake
neither
sky
nor
sunset
was
reflected
on
its
sullen
surface
the
sirannon
had
been
dammed
and
had
filled
all
the
valley
beyond
the
ominous
water
were
reared
vast
cliffs
their
stern
faces
pallid
in
the
fading
light
final
and
impassable
no
sign
of
gate
or
entrance
not
a
fissure
or
crack
could
frodo
see
in
the
frowning
stone

there
are
the
walls
of
moria'
said
gandalf
pointing
across
the
water
and
there
the
gate
stood
once
upon
a
time
the
elven
door
at
the
end
of
the
road
from
hollin
by
which
we
have
come
but
this
way
is
blocked
none
of
the
company
I
guess
will
wish
to
swim
this
gloomy
water
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
has
an
unwholesome
look'

we
must
find
a
way
round
the
northern
edge'
said
gimli
the
first
thing
for
the
company
to
do
is
to
climb
up
by
the
main
path
and
see
where
that
will
lead
us
even
if
there
were
no
lake
we
could
not
get
our
baggagepony
up
this
stair'

but
in
any
case
we
cannot
take
the
poor
beast
into
the
mines'
said
gandalf
the
road
under
the
mountains
is
a
dark
road
and
there
are
places
narrow
and
steep
which
he
cannot
tread
even
if
we
can'

poor
old
bill
'
said
frodo
I
had
not
thought
of
that
and
poor
sam
I
wonder
what
he
will
say
'


I
am
sorry'
said
gandalf
poor
bill
has
been
a
useful
companion
and
it
goes
to
my
heart
to
turn
him
adrift
now
I
would
have
travelled
lighter
and
brought
no
animal
least
of
all
this
one
that
sam
is
fond
of
if
I
had
had
my
way
I
feared
all
along
that
we
should
be
obliged
to
take
this
road'

the
day
was
drawing
to
its
end
and
cold
stars
were
glinting
in
the
sky
high
above
the
sunset
when
the
company
with
all
the
speed
they
could
climbed
up
the
slopes
and
reached
the
side
of
the
lake
in
breadth
it
looked
to
be
no
more
than
two
or
three
furlongs
at
the
widest
point
how
far
it
stretched
away
southward
they
could
not
see
in
the
failing
light
but
its
northern
end
was
no
more
than
half
a
mile
from
where
they
stood
and
between
the
stony
ridges
that
enclosed
the
valley
and
the
water's
edge
there
was
a
rim
of
open
ground
they
hurried
forward
for
they
had
still
a
mile
or
two
to
go
before
they
could
reach
the
point
on
the
far
shore
that
gandalf
was
making
for
and
then
he
had
still
to
find
the
doors

when
they
came
to
the
northernmost
corner
of
the
lake
they
found
a
narrow
creek
that
barred
their
way
it
was
green
and
stagnant
thrust
out
like
a
slimy
arm
towards
the
enclosing
hills
gimli
strode
forward
undeterred
and
found
that
the
water
was
shallow
no
more
than
ankledeep
at
the
edge
behind
him
they
walked
in
file
threading
their
way
with
care
for
under
the
weedy
pools
were
sliding
and
greasy
stones
and
footing
was
treacherous
frodo
shuddered
with
disgust
at
the
touch
of
the
dark
unclean
water
on
his
feet

as
sam
the
last
of
the
company
led
bill
up
on
to
the
dry
ground
on
the
far
side
there
came
a
soft
sound
a
swish
followed
by
a
plop
as
if
a
fish
had
disturbed
the
still
surface
of
the
water
turning
quickly
they
saw
ripples
blackedged
with
shadow
in
the
waning
light
great
rings
were
widening
outwards
from
a
point
far
out
in
the
lake
there
was
a
bubbling
noise
and
then
silence
the
dusk
deepened
and
the
last
gleams
of
the
sunset
were
veiled
in
cloud

gandalf
now
pressed
on
at
a
great
pace
and
the
others
followed
as
quickly
as
they
could
they
reached
the
strip
of
dry
land
between
the
lake
and
the
cliffs
it
was
narrow
often
hardly
a
dozen
yards
across
and
encumbered
with
fallen
rock
and
stones
but
they
found
a
way
hugging
the
cliff
and
keeping
as
far
from
the
dark
water
as
they
might
a
mile
southwards
along
the
shore
they
came
upon
holly
trees
stumps
and
dead
boughs
were
rotting
in
the
shallows
the
remains
it
seemed
of
old
thickets
or
of
a
hedge
that
had
once
lined
the
road
across
the
drowned
valley
but
close
under
the
cliff
there
stood
still
strong
and
living

two
tall
trees
larger
than
any
trees
of
holly
that
frodo
had
ever
seen
or
imagined
their
great
roots
spread
from
the
wall
to
the
water
under
the
looming
cliffs
they
had
looked
like
mere
bushes
when
seen
far
off
from
the
top
of
the
stair
but
now
they
towered
overhead
stiff
dark
and
silent
throwing
deep
nightshadows
about
their
feet
standing
like
sentinel
pillars
at
the
end
of
the
road

well
here
we
are
at
last
'
said
gandalf
'here
the
elvenway
from
hollin
ended
holly
was
the
token
of
the
people
of
that
land
and
they
planted
it
here
to
mark
the
end
of
their
domain
for
the
westdoor
was
made
chiefly
for
their
use
in
their
traffic
with
the
lords
of
moria
those
were
happier
days
when
there
was
still
close
friendship
at
times
between
folk
of
different
race
even
between
dwarves
and
elves'

'it
was
not
the
fault
of
the
dwarves
that
the
friendship
waned'
said
gimli

'i
have
not
heard
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
elves'
said
legolas

'i
have
heard
both'
said
gandalf
'and
I
will
not
give
judgement
now
but
I
beg
you
two
legolas
and
gimli
at
least
to
be
friends
and
to
help
me
I
need
you
both
the
doors
are
shut
and
hidden
and
the
sooner
we
find
them
the
better
night
is
at
hand
'

turning
to
the
others
he
said
'while
I
am
searching
will
you
each
make
ready
to
enter
the
mines
for
here
I
fear
we
must
say
farewell
to
our
good
beast
of
burden
you
must
lay
aside
much
of
the
stuff
that
we
brought
against
bitter
weather
you
will
not
need
it
inside
nor
I
hope
when
we
come
through
and
journey
on
down
into
the
south
instead
each
of
us
must
take
a
share
of
what
the
pony
carried
especially
the
food
and
the
waterskins'

'but
you
can't
leave
poor
old
bill
behind
in
this
forsaken
place
mr
gandalf
'
cried
sam
angry
and
distressed
I
won't
have
it
and
that's
flat
after
he
has
come
so
far
and
all
'


'i
am
sorry
sam'
said
the
wizard
but
when
the
door
opens
I
do
not
think
you
will
be
able
to
drag
your
bill
inside
into
the
long
dark
of
moria
you
will
have
to
choose
between
bill
and
your
master'

'he'd
follow
mr
frodo
into
a
dragon's
den
if
I
led
him'
protested
sam
it'd
be
nothing
short
of
murder
to
turn
him
loose
with
all
these
wolves
about'

'it
will
be
short
of
murder
I
hope'
said
gandalf
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
pony's
head
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
go
with
words
of
guard
and
guiding
on
you'
he
said
you
are
a
wise
beast
and
have
learned
much
in
rivendell
make
your
ways
to
places
where
you
can
find
grass
and
so
come
in
time
to
elrond's
house
or
wherever
you
wish
to
go

there
sam
he
will
have
quite
as
much
chance
of
escaping
wolves
and
getting
home
as
we
have'

sam
stood
sullenly
by
the
pony
and
returned
no
answer
bill
seeming
to
understand
well
what
was
going
on
nuzzled
up
to
him
putting
his
nose
to
sam's
ear
sam
burst
into
tears
and
fumbled
with
the
straps
unlading
all
the
pony's
packs
and
throwing
them
on
the
ground
the
others
sorted
out
the
goods
making
a
pile
of
all
that
could
be
left
behind
and
dividing
up
the
rest

when
this
was
done
they
turned
to
watch
gandalf
he
appeared
to
have
done
nothing
he
was
standing
between
the
two
trees
gazing
at
the
blank
wall
of
the
cliff
as
if
he
would
bore
a
hole
into
it
with
his
eyes
gimli
was
wandering
about
tapping
the
stone
here
and
there
with
his
axe
legolas
was
pressed
against
the
rock
as
if
listening

'well
here
we
are
and
all
ready'
said
merry
but
where
are
the
doors
I
can't
see
any
sign
of
them'

'dwarfdoors
are
not
made
to
be
seen
when
shut'
said
gimli
they
are
invisible
and
their
own
masters
cannot
find
them
or
open
them
if
their
secret
is
forgotten'

'but
this
door
was
not
made
to
be
a
secret
known
only
to
dwarves'
said
gandalf
coming
suddenly
to
life
and
turning
round
unless
things
are
altogether
changed
eyes
that
know
what
to
look
for
may
discover
the
signs'

he
walked
forward
to
the
wall
right
between
the
shadow
of
the
trees
there
was
a
smooth
space
and
over
this
he
passed
his
hands
to
and
fro
muttering
words
under
his
breath
then
he
stepped
back

'look'
he
said
can
you
see
anything
now'

the
moon
now
shone
upon
the
grey
face
of
the
rock
but
they
could
see
nothing
else
for
a
while
then
slowly
on
the
surface
where
the
wizard's
hands
had
passed
faint
lines
appeared
like
slender
veins
of
silver
running
in
the
stone
at
first
they
were
no
more
than
pale
gossamerthreads
so
fine
that
they
only
twinkled
fitfully
where
the
moon
caught
them
but
steadily
they
grew
broader
and
clearer
until
their
design
could
be
guessed

at
the
top
as
high
as
gandalf
could
reach
was
an
arch
of
interlacing
letters
in
an
elvish
character
below
though
the
threads
were
in
places
blurred
or
broken
the
outline
could
be
seen
of
an
anvil
and
a
hammer
surmounted
by
a
crown
with
seven
stars
beneath
these
again
were
two
trees
each
bearing
crescent
moons
more
clearly
than
all
else
there
shone
forth
in
the
middle
of
the
door
a
single
star
with
many
rays

there
are
the
emblems
of
durin'
cried
gimli

and
there
is
the
tree
of
the
high
elves'
said
legolas

and
the
star
of
the
house
of
fanor'
said
gandalf
they
are
wrought
of

ithildin

that
mirrors
only
starlight
and
moonlight
and
sleeps
until
it
is
touched
by
one
who
speaks
words
now
long
forgotten
in
middleearth
it
is
long
since
I
heard
them
and
I
thought
deeply
before
I
could
recall
them
to
my
mind'

'what
does
the
writing
say'
asked
frodo
who
was
trying
to
decipher
the
inscription
on
the
arch
'i
thought
I
knew
the
elfletters
but
I
cannot
read
these'


the
words
are
in
the
elventongue
of
the
west
of
middleearth
in
the
elder
days'
answered
gandalf
'but
they
do
not
say
anything
of
importance
to
us
they
say
only

the
doors
of
durin
lord
of
moria
speak
friend
and
enter

and
underneath
small
and
faint
is
written

I
narvi
made
them
celebrimbor
of
hollin
drew
these
signs
'

what
does
it
mean
by

speak
friend
and
enter
'
asked
merry

'that
is
plain
enough'
said
gimli
if
you
are
a
friend
speak
the
password
and
the
doors
will
open
and
you
can
enter'

'yes'
said
gandalf
'these
doors
are
probably
governed
by
words
some
dwarfgates
will
open
only
at
special
times
or
for
particular
persons
and
some
have
locks
and
keys
that
are
still
needed
when
all
necessary
times
and
words
are
known
these
doors
have
no
key
in
the
days
of
durin
they
were
not
secret
they
usually
stood
open
and
doorwards
sat
here
but
if
they
were
shut
any
who
knew
the
opening
word
could
speak
it
and
pass
in
at
least
so
it
is
recorded
is
it
not
gimli
'

'it
is'
said
the
dwarf
but
what
the
word
was
is
not
remembered
narvi
and
his
craft
and
all
his
kindred
have
vanished
from
the
earth'


'but
do
not

you

know
the
word
gandalf
'
asked
boromir
in
surprise

no
'
said
the
wizard

the
others
looked
dismayed
only
aragorn
who
knew
gandalf
well
remained
silent
and
unmoved

'then
what
was
the
use
of
bringing
us
to
this
accursed
spot'
cried
boromir
glancing
back
with
a
shudder
at
the
dark
water
you
told
us
that
you
had
once
passed
through
the
mines
how
could
that
be
if
you
did
not
know
how
to
enter
'

the
answer
to
your
first
question
boromir'
said
the
wizard
is
that
I
do
not
know
the
wordyet
but
we
shall
soon
see
and'
he
added
with
a
glint
in
his
eyes
under
their
bristling
brows
'you
may
ask
what
is
the
use
of
my
deeds
when
they
are
proved
useless
as
for
your
other
question
do
you
doubt
my
tale
or
have
you
no
wits
left
I
did
not
enter
this
way
I
came
from
the
east

if
you
wish
to
know
I
will
tell
you
that
these
doors
open
outwards
from
the
inside
you
may
thrust
them
open
with
your
hands
from
the
outside
nothing
will
move
them
save
the
spell
of
command
they
cannot
be
forced
inwards'

what
are
you
going
to
do
then
'
asked
pippin
undaunted
by
the
wizard's
bristling
brows

knock
on
the
doors
with
your
head
peregrin
took'
said
gandalf
but
if
that
does
not
shatter
them
and
I
am
allowed
a
little
peace
from
foolish
questions
I
will
seek
for
the
opening
words

I
once
knew
every
spell
in
all
the
tongues
of
elves
or
men
or
orcs
that
was
ever
used
for
such
a
purpose
I
can
still
remember
ten
score
of
them
without
searching
in
my
mind
but
only
a
few
trials
I
think
will
be
needed
and
I
shall
not
have
to
call
on
gimli
for
words
of
the
secret
dwarftongue
that
they
teach
to
none
the
opening
words
were
elvish
like
the
writing
on
the
arch
that
seems
certain'

he
stepped
up
to
the
rock
again
and
lightly
touched
with
his
staff
the
silver
star
in
the
middle
beneath
the
sign
of
the
anvil

annon
edhellen
edro
hi
ammen

fennas
nogothrim
lasto
beth
lammen

he
said
in
a
commanding
voice
the
silver
lines
faded
but
the
blank
grey
stone
did
not
stir

many
times
he
repeated
these
words
in
different
order
or
varied
them
then
he
tried
other
spells
one
after
another
speaking
now
faster
and
louder
now
soft
and
slow
then
he
spoke
many
single
words
of
elvish
speech
nothing
happened
the
cliff
towered
into
the
night
the
countless
stars
were
kindled
the
wind
blew
cold
and
the
doors
stood
fast

again
gandalf
approached
the
wall
and
lifting
up
his
arms
he
spoke
in
tones
of
command
and
rising
wrath

edro
edro

he
cried
and
struck
the
rock
with
his
staff

open
open

he
shouted
and
followed
it
with
the
same
command
in
every
language
that
had
ever
been
spoken
in
the
west
of
middleearth
then
he
threw
his
staff
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
in
silence

at
that
moment
from
far
off
the
wind
bore
to
their
listening
ears
the
howling
of
wolves
bill
the
pony
started
in
fear
and
sam
sprang
to
his
side
and
whispered
softly
to
him

'do
not
let
him
run
away
'
said
boromir
'it
seems
that
we
shall
need
him
still
if
the
wolves
do
not
find
us
how
I
hate
this
foul
pool
'
he
stooped
and
picking
up
a
large
stone
he
cast
it
far
into
the
dark
water

the
stone
vanished
with
a
soft
slap
but
at
the
same
instant
there
was
a
swish
and
a
bubble
great
rippling
rings
formed
on
the
surface
out
beyond
where
the
stone
had
fallen
and
they
moved
slowly
towards
the
foot
of
the
cliff

'why
did
you
do
that
boromir
'
said
frodo
I
hate
this
place
too
and
I
am
afraid
I
don't
know
of
what
not
of
wolves
or
the
dark
behind
the
doors
but
of
something
else
I
am
afraid
of
the
pool
don't
disturb
it
'

'l
wish
we
could
get
away
'
said
merry

'why
doesn't
gandalf
do
something
quick
'
said
pippin

gandalf
took
no
notice
of
them
he
sat
with
his
head
bowed
either
in
despair
or
in
anxious
thought
the
mournful
howling
of
the
wolves
was
heard
again
the
ripples
on
the
water
grew
and
came
closer
some
were
already
lapping
on
the
shore

with
a
suddenness
that
startled
them
all
the
wizard
sprang
to
his
feet
he
was
laughing
I
have
it
'
he
cried
'of
course
of
course
absurdly
simple
like
most
riddles
when
you
see
the
answer'

picking
up
his
staff
he
stood
before
the
rock
and
said
in
a
clear
voice

mellon


the
star
shone
out
briefly
and
faded
again
then
silently
a
great
doorway
was
outlined
though
not
a
crack
or
joint
had
been
visible
before
slowly
it
divided
in
the
middle
and
swung
outwards
inch
by
inch
until
both
doors
lay
back
against
the
wall
through
the
opening
a
shadowy
stair
could
be
seen
climbing
steeply
up
but
beyond
the
lower
steps
the
darkness
was
deeper
than
the
night
the
company
stared
in
wonder

I
was
wrong
after
all'
said
gandalf
'and
gimli
too
merry
of
all
people
was
on
the
right
track
the
opening
word
was
inscribed
on
the
archway
all
the
time
the
translation
should
have
been

say
friend
and
enter

I
had
only
to
speak
the
elvish
word
for

friend

and
the
doors
opened
quite
simple
too
simple
for
a
learned
loremaster
in
these
suspicious
days
those
were
happier
times
now
let
us
go'

he
strode
forward
and
set
his
foot
on
the
lowest
step
but
at
that
moment
several
things
happened
frodo
felt
something
seize
him
by
the
ankle
and
he
fell
with
a
cry
bill
the
pony
gave
a
wild
neigh
of
fear
and
turned
tail
and
dashed
away
along
the
lakeside
into
the
darkness
sam
leaped
after
him
and
then
hearing
frodo's
cry
he
ran
back
again
weeping
and
cursing
the
others
swung
round
and
saw
the
waters
of
the
lake
seething
as
if
a
host
of
snakes
were
swimming
up
from
the
southern
end

out
from
the
water
a
long
sinuous
tentacle
had
crawled
it
was
palegreen
and
luminous
and
wet
its
fingered
end
had
hold
of
frodo's
foot
and
was
dragging
him
into
the
water
sam
on
his
knees
was
now
slashing
at
it
with
a
knife

the
arm
let
go
of
frodo
and
sam
pulled
him
away
crying
out
for
help
twenty
others
arms
came
rippling
out
the
dark
water
boiled
and
there
was
a
hideous
stench

into
the
gateway
up
the
stairs
quick
'
shouted
gandalf
leaping
back
rousing
them
from
the
horror
that
seemed
to
have
rooted
all
but
sam
to
the
ground
where
they
stood
he
drove
them
forward

they
were
just
in
time
sam
and
frodo
were
only
a
few
steps
up
and
gandalf
had
just
begun
to
climb
when
the
groping
tentacles
writhed
across
the
narrow
shore
and
fingered
the
cliffwall
and
the
doors
one
came
wriggling
over
the
threshold
glistening
in
the
starlight
gandalf
turned
and
paused
if
he
was
considering
what
word
would
close
the
gate
again
from
within
there
was
no
need
many
coiling
arms
seized
the
doors
on
either
side
and
with
horrible
strength
swung
them
round
with
a
shattering
echo
they
slammed
and
all
light
was
lost
a
noise
of
rending
and
crashing
came
dully
through
the
ponderous
stone

sam
clinging
to
frodo's
arm
collapsed
on
a
step
in
the
black
darkness
poor
old
bill
'
he
said
in
a
choking
voice
poor
old
bill
wolves
and
snakes
but
the
snakes
were
too
much
for
him
I
had
to
choose
mr
frodo
I
had
to
come
with
you'

they
heard
gandalf
go
back
down
the
steps
and
thrust
his
staff
against
the
doors
there
was
a
quiver
in
the
stone
and
the
stairs
trembled
but
the
doors
did
not
open
well
well
'
said
the
wizard
the
passage
is
blocked
behind
us
now
and
there
is
only
one
way
outon
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
I
fear
from
the
sounds
that
boulders
have
been
piled
up
and
the
trees
uprooted
and
thrown
across
the
gate
I
am
sorry
for
the
trees
were
beautiful
and
had
stood
so
long'

I
felt
that
something
horrible
was
near
from
the
moment
that
my
foot
first
touched
the
water'
said
frodo
'what
was
the
thing
or
were
there
many
of
them
'

'i
do
not
know'
answered
gandalf
'but
the
arms
were
all
guided
by
one
purpose
something
has
crept
or
has
been
driven
out
of
dark
waters
under
the
mountains
there
are
older
and
fouler
things
than
orcs
in
the
deep
places
of
the
world'
he
did
not
speak
aloud
his
thought
that
whatever
it
was
that
dwelt
in
the
lake
it
had
seized
on
frodo
first
among
all
the
company

boromir
muttered
under
his
breath
but
the
echoing
stone
magnified
the
sound
to
a
hoarse
whisper
that
all
could
hear
in
the
deep
places
of
the
world
and
thither
we
are
going
against
my
wish
who
will
lead
us
now
in
this
deadly
dark
'

'i
will'
said
gandalf
'and
gimli
shall
walk
with
me
follow
my
staff
'

as
the
wizard
passed
on
ahead
up
the
great
steps
he
held
his
staff
aloft
and
from
its
tip
there
came
a
faint
radiance
the
wide
stairway
was
sound
and
undamaged
two
hundred
steps
they
counted
broad
and
shallow
and
at
the
top
they
found
an
arched
passage
with
a
level
floor
leading
on
into
the
dark

let
us
sit
and
rest
and
have
something
to
eat
here
on
the
landing
since
we
can't
find
a
diningroom
'
said
frodo
he
had
begun
to
shake
off
the
terror
of
the
clutching
arm
and
suddenly
he
felt
extremely
hungry

the
proposal
was
welcomed
by
all
and
they
sat
down
on
the
upper
steps
dim
figures
in
the
gloom
after
they
had
eaten
gandalf
gave
them
each
a
third
sip
of
the
miruvor
of
rivendell

it
will
not
last
much
longer
I
am
afraid'
he
said
'but
I
think
we
need
it
after
that
horror
at
the
gate
and
unless
we
have
great
luck
we
shall
need
all
that
is
left
before
we
see
the
other
side
go
carefully
with
the
water
too
there
are
many
streams
and
wells
in
the
mines
but
they
should
not
be
touched
we
may
not
have
a
chance
of
filling
our
skins
and
bottles
till
we
come
down
into
dimrill
dale'

'how
long
is
that
going
to
take
us
'
asked
frodo

'i
cannot
say'
answered
gandalf
'it
depends
on
many
chances
but
going
straight
without
mishap
or
losing
our
way
we
shall
take
three
or
four
marches
I
expect
it
cannot
be
less
than
forty
miles
from
westdoor
to
eastgate
in
a
direct
line
and
the
road
may
wind
much'

after
only
a
brief
rest
they
started
on
their
way
again
all
were
eager
to
get
the
journey
over
as
quickly
as
possible
and
were
willing
tired
as
they
were
to
go
on
marching
still
for
several
hours
gandalf
walked
in
front
as
before
in
his
left
hand
he
held
up
his
glimmering
staff
the
light
of
which
just
showed
the
ground
before
his
feet
in
his
right
he
held
his
sword
glamdring
behind
him
came
gimli
his
eyes
glinting
in
the
dim
light
as
he
turned
his
head
from
side
to
side
behind
the
dwarf
walked
frodo
and
he
had
drawn
the
short
sword
sting
no
gleam
came
from
the
blades
of
sting
or
of
glamdring
and
that
was
some
comfort
for
being
the
work
of
elvish
smiths
in
the
elder
days
these
swords
shone
with
a
cold
light
if
any
orcs
were
near
at
hand
behind
frodo
went
sam
and
after
him
legolas
and
the
young
hobbits
and
boromir
in
the
dark
at
the
rear
grim
and
silent
walked
aragorn

the
passage
twisted
round
a
few
turns
and
then
began
to
descend
it
went
steadily
down
for
a
long
while
before
it
became
level
once
again
the
air
grew
hot
and
stifling
but
it
was
not
foul
and
at
times
they
felt
currents
of
cooler
air
upon
their
faces
issuing
from
halfguessed
openings
in
the
walls
there
were
many
of
these
in
the
pale
ray
of
the
wizard's
staff
frodo
caught
glimpses
of
stairs
and
arches
and
of
other
passages
and
tunnels
sloping
up
or
running
steeply
down
or
opening
blankly
dark
on
either
side
it
was
bewildering
beyond
hope
of
remembering

gimli
aided
gandalf
very
little
except
by
his
stout
courage
at
least
he
was
not
as
were
most
of
the
others
troubled
by
the
mere
darkness
in
itself
often
the
wizard
consulted
him
at
points
where
the
choice
of
way
was
doubtful
but
it
was
always
gandalf
who
had
the
final
word
the
mines
of
moria
were
vast
and
intricate
beyond
the
imagination
of
gimli
glin's
son
dwarf
of
the
mountainrace
though
he
was
to
gandalf
the
faroff
memories
of
a
journey
long
before
were
now
of
little
help
but
even
in
the
gloom
and
despite
all
windings
of
the
road
he
knew
whither
he
wished
to
go
and
he
did
not
falter
as
long
as
there
was
a
path
that
led
towards
his
goal

do
not
be
afraid
'
said
aragorn
there
was
a
pause
longer
than
usual
and
gandalf
and
gimli
were
whispering
together
the
others
were
crowded
behind
waiting
anxiously
do
not
be
afraid
I
have
been
with
him
on
many
a
journey
if
never
on
one
so
dark
and
there
are
tales
of
rivendell
of
greater
deeds
of
his
than
any
that
I
have
seen
he
will
not
go
astrayif
there
is
any
path
to
find
he
has
led
us
in
here
against
our
fears
but
he
will
lead
us
out
again
at
whatever
cost
to
himself
he
is
surer
of
finding
the
way
home
in
a
blind
night
than
the
cats
of
queen
berthiel'

it
was
well
for
the
company
that
they
had
such
a
guide
they
had
no
fuel
nor
any
means
of
making
torches
in
the
desperate
scramble
at
the
doors
many
things
had
been
left
behind
but
without
any
light
they
would
soon
have
come
to
grief
there
were
not
only
many
roads
to
choose
from
there
were
also
in
many
places
holes
and
pitfalls
and
dark
wells
beside
the
path
in
which
their
passing
feet
echoed
there
were
fissures
and
chasms
in
the
walls
and
floor
and
every
now
and
then
a
crack
would
open
right
before
their
feet
the
widest
was
more
than
seven
feet
across
and
it
was
long
before
pippin
could
summon
enough
courage
to
leap
over
the
dreadful
gap
the
noise
of
churning
water
came
up
from
far
below
as
if
some
great
millwheel
was
turning
in
the
depths

rope
'
muttered
sam
I
knew
i'd
want
it
if
I
hadn't
got
it
'

as
these
dangers
became
more
frequent
their
march
became
slower
already
they
seemed
to
have
been
tramping
on
on
endlessly
to
the
mountains'
roots
they
were
more
than
weary
and
yet
there
seemed
no
comfort
in
the
thought
of
halting
anywhere
frodo's
spirits
had
risen
for
a
while
after
his
escape
and
after
food
and
a
draught
of
the
cordial
but
now
a
deep
uneasiness
growing
to
dread
crept
over
him
again
though
he
had
been
healed
in
rivendell
of
the
knifestroke
that
grim
wound
had
not
been
without
effect
his
senses
were
sharper
and
more
aware
of
things
that
could
not
be
seen
one
sign
of
change
that
he
soon
had
noticed
was
that
he
could
see
more
in
the
dark
than
any
of
his
companions
save
perhaps
gandalf
and
he
was
in
any
case
the
bearer
of
the
ring
it
hung
upon
its
chain
against
his
breast
and
at
whiles
it
seemed
a
heavy
weight
he
felt
the
certainty
of
evil
ahead
and
of
evil
following
but
he
said
nothing
he
gripped
tighter
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
went
on
doggedly

the
company
behind
him
spoke
seldom
and
then
only
in
hurried
whispers
there
was
no
sound
but
the
sound
of
their
own
feet
the
dull
stump
of
gimli's
dwarfboots
the
heavy
tread
of
boromir
the
light
step
of
legolas
the
soft
scarceheard
patter
of
hobbitfeet
and
in
the
rear
the
slow
firm
footfalls
of
aragorn
with
his
long
stride
when
they
halted
for
a
moment
they
heard
nothing
at
all
unless
it
were
occasionally
a
faint
trickle
and
drip
of
unseen
water
yet
frodo
began
to
hear
or
to
imagine
that
he
heard
something
else
like
the
faint
fall
of
soft
bare
feet
it
was
never
loud
enough
or
near
enough
for
him
to
feel
certain
that
he
heard
it
but
once
it
had
started
it
never
stopped
while
the
company
was
moving
but
it
was
not
an
echo
for
when
they
halted
it
pattered
on
for
a
little
all
by
itself
and
then
grew
still

it
was
after
nightfall
when
they
had
entered
the
mines
they
had
been
going
for
several
hours
with
only
brief
halts
when
gandalf
came
to
his
first
serious
check
before
him
stood
a
wide
dark
arch
opening
into
three
passages
all
led
in
the
same
general
direction
eastwards
but
the
lefthand
passage
plunged
down
while
the
righthand
climbed
up
and
the
middle
way
seemed
to
run
on
smooth
and
level
but
very
narrow

'i
have
no
memory
of
this
place
at
all
'
said
gandalf
standing
uncertainly
under
the
arch
he
held
up
his
staff
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
marks
or
inscription
that
might
help
his
choice
but
nothing
of
the
kind
was
to
be
seen
I
am
too
weary
to
decide'
he
said
shaking
his
head
and
I
expect
that
you
are
all
as
weary
as
I
am
or
wearier
we
had
better
halt
here
for
what
is
left
of
the
night
you
know
what
I
mean
in
here
it
is
ever
dark
but
outside
the
late
moon
is
riding
westward
and
the
middlenight
has
passed'

poor
old
bill
'
said
sam
'i
wonder
where
he
is
I
hope
those
wolves
haven't
got
him
yet'

to
the
left
of
the
great
arch
they
found
a
stone
door
it
was
half
closed
but
swung
back
easily
to
a
gentle
thrust
beyond
there
seemed
to
lie
a
wide
chamber
cut
in
the
rock

steady
steady
'
cried
gandalf
as
merry
and
pippin
pushed
forward
glad
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
rest
with
at
least
more
feeling
of
shelter
than
in
the
open
passage
steady
you
do
not
know
what
is
inside
yet
I
will
go
first'

he
went
in
cautiously
and
the
others
filed
behind
there
'
he
said
pointing
with
his
staff
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
before
his
feet
they
saw
a
large
round
hole
like
the
mouth
of
a
well
broken
and
rusty
chains
lay
at
the
edge
and
trailed
down
into
the
black
pit
fragments
of
stone
lay
near

'one
of
you
might
have
fallen
in
and
still
be
wondering
when
you
were
going
to
strike
the
bottom'
said
aragorn
to
merry
'let
the
guide
go
first
while
you
have
one'

'this
seems
to
have
been
a
guardroom
made
for
the
watching
of
the
three
passages'
said
gimli
that
hole
was
plainly
a
well
for
the
guards'
use
covered
with
a
stone
lid
but
the
lid
is
broken
and
we
must
all
take
care
in
the
dark'

pippin
felt
curiously
attracted
by
the
well
while
the
others
were
unrolling
blankets
and
making
beds
against
the
walls
of
the
chamber
as
far
as
possible
from
the
hole
in
the
floor
he
crept
to
the
edge
and
peered
over
a
chill
air
seemed
to
strike
his
face
rising
from
invisible
depths
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
he
groped
for
a
loose
stone
and
let
it
drop
he
felt
his
heart
beat
many
times
before
there
was
any
sound
then
far
below
as
if
the
stone
had
fallen
into
deep
water
in
some
cavernous
place
there
came
a

plunk

very
distant
but
magnified
and
repeated
in
the
hollow
shaft

what's
that
'
cried
gandalf
he
was
relieved
when
pippin
confessed
what
he
had
done
but
he
was
angry
and
pippin
could
see
his
eye
glinting
'fool
of
a
took
'
he
growled
'this
is
a
serious
journey
not
a
hobbit
walkingparty
throw
yourself
in
next
time
and
then
you
will
be
no
further
nuisance
now
be
quiet
'

nothing
more
was
heard
for
several
minutes
but
then
there
came
out
of
the
depths
faint
knocks

tomtap
taptom

they
stopped
and
when
the
echoes
had
died
away
they
were
repeated

taptom
tomtap
taptap
tom

they
sounded
disquietingly
like
signals
of
some
sort
but
after
a
while
the
knocking
died
away
and
was
not
heard
again

'that
was
the
sound
of
a
hammer
or
I
have
never
heard
one'
said
gimli

yes'
said
gandalf
'and
I
do
not
like
it
it
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
peregrin's
foolish
stone
but
probably
something
has
been
disturbed
that
would
have
been
better
left
quiet
pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind
again
let
us
hope
we
shall
get
some
rest
without
further
trouble
you
pippin
can
go
on
the
first
watch
as
a
reward'
he
growled
as
he
rolled
himself
in
a
blanket

pippin
sat
miserably
by
the
door
in
the
pitch
dark
but
he
kept
on
turning
round
fearing
that
some
unknown
thing
would
crawl
up
out
of
the
well
he
wished
he
could
cover
the
hole
if
only
with
a
blanket
but
he
dared
not
move
or
go
near
it
even
though
gandalf
seemed
to
be
asleep

actually
gandalf
was
awake
though
lying
still
and
silent
he
was
deep
in
thought
trying
to
recall
every
memory
of
his
former
journey
in
the
mines
and
considering
anxiously
the
next
course
that
he
should
take
a
false
turn
now
might
be
disastrous
after
an
hour
he
rose
up
and
came
over
to
pippin

get
into
a
corner
and
have
a
sleep
my
lad'
he
said
in
a
kindly
tone
'you
want
to
sleep
I
expect
I
cannot
get
a
wink
so
I
may
as
well
do
the
watching'


'i
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me'
he
muttered
as
he
sat
down
by
the
door
'i
need
smoke
I
have
not
tasted
it
since
the
morning
before
the
snowstorm'

the
last
thing
that
pippin
saw
as
sleep
took
him
was
a
dark
glimpse
of
the
old
wizard
huddled
on
the
floor
shielding
a
glowing
chip
in
his
gnarled
hands
between
his
knees
the
flicker
for
a
moment
showed
his
sharp
nose
and
the
puff
of
smoke

it
was
gandalf
who
roused
them
all
from
sleep
he
had
sat
and
watched
all
alone
for
about
six
hours
and
had
let
the
others
rest
and
in
the
watches
I
have
made
up
my
mind'
he
said
I
do
not
like
the
feel
of
the
middle
way
and
I
do
not
like
the
smell
of
the
lefthand
way
there
is
foul
air
down
there
or
I
am
no
guide
I
shall
take
the
righthand
passage
it
is
time
we
began
to
climb
up
again'

for
eight
dark
hours
not
counting
two
brief
halts
they
marched
on
and
they
met
no
danger
and
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
the
faint
gleam
of
the
wizard's
light
bobbing
like
a
willo'thewisp
in
front
of
them
the
passage
they
had
chosen
wound
steadily
upwards
as
far
as
they
could
judge
it
went
in
great
mounting
curves
and
as
it
rose
it
grew
loftier
and
wider
there
were
now
no
openings
to
other
galleries
or
tunnels
on
either
side
and
the
floor
was
level
and
sound
without
pits
or
cracks
evidently
they
had
struck
what
once
had
been
an
important
road
and
they
went
forward
quicker
than
they
had
done
on
their
first
march

in
this
way
they
advanced
some
fifteen
miles
measured
in
a
direct
line
east
though
they
must
have
actually
walked
twenty
miles
or
more
as
the
road
climbed
upwards
frodo's
spirits
rose
a
little
but
he
still
felt
oppressed
and
still
at
times
he
heard
or
thought
he
heard
away
behind
the
company
and
beyond
the
fall
and
patter
of
their
feet
a
following
footstep
that
was
not
an
echo

they
had
marched
as
far
as
the
hobbits
could
endure
without
a
rest
and
all
were
thinking
of
a
place
where
they
could
sleep
when
suddenly
the
walls
to
right
and
left
vanished
they
seemed
to
have
passed
through
some
arched
doorway
into
a
black
and
empty
space
there
was
a
great
draught
of
warmer
air
behind
them
and
before
them
the
darkness
was
cold
on
their
faces
they
halted
and
crowded
anxiously
together

gandalf
seemed
pleased
I
chose
the
right
way'
he
said
at
last
we
are
coming
to
the
habitable
parts
and
I
guess
that
we
are
not
far
now
from
the
eastern
side
but
we
are
high
up
a
good
deal
higher
than
the
dimrill
gate
unless
I
am
mistaken
from
the
feeling
of
the
air
we
must
be
in
a
wide
hall
I
will
now
risk
a
little
real
light'

he
raised
his
staff
and
for
a
brief
instant
there
was
blaze
like
a
flash
of
lightning
great
shadows
sprang
up
and
fled
and
for
a
second
they
saw
a
vast
roof
far
above
their
heads
upheld
by
many
mighty
pillars
hewn
of
stone
before
them
and
on
either
side
stretched
a
huge
empty
hall
its
black
walls
polished
and
smooth
as
glass
flashed
and
glittered
three
other
entrances
they
saw
dark
black
arches
one
straight
before
them
eastwards
and
one
on
either
side
then
the
light
went
out

that
is
all
that
I
shall
venture
on
for
the
present'
said
gandalf
'there
used
to
be
great
windows
on
the
mountainside
and
shafts
leading
out
to
the
light
in
the
upper
reaches
of
the
mines
I
think
we
have
reached
them
now
but
it
is
night
outside
again
and
we
cannot
tell
until
morning
if
I
am
right
tomorrow
we
may
actually
see
the
morning
peeping
in
but
in
the
meanwhile
we
had
better
go
no
further
let
us
rest
if
we
can
things
have
gone
well
so
far
and
the
greater
part
of
the
dark
road
is
over
but
we
are
not
through
yet
and
it
is
a
long
way
down
to
the
gates
that
open
on
the
world'

the
company
spent
that
night
in
the
great
cavernous
hall
huddled
close
together
in
a
corner
to
escape
the
draught
there
seemed
to
be
a
steady
inflow
of
chill
air
through
the
eastern
archway
all
about
them
as
they
lay
hung
the
darkness
hollow
and
immense
and
they
were
oppressed
by
the
loneliness
and
vastness
of
the
dolven
halls
and
endlessly
branching
stairs
and
passages
the
wildest
imaginings
that
dark
rumour
had
ever
suggested
to
the
hobbits
fell
altogether
short
of
the
actual
dread
and
wonder
of
moria


there
must
have
been
a
mighty
crowd
of
dwarves
here
at
one
time
'
said
sam
and
every
one
of
them
busier
than
badgers
for
five
hundred
years
to
make
all
this
and
most
in
hard
rock
too
what
did
they
do
it
all
for
they
didn't
live
in
these
darksome
holes
surely
'

these
are
not
holes'
said
gimli
this
is
the
great
realm
and
city
of
the
dwarrowdelf
and
of
old
it
was
not
darksome
but
full
of
light
and
splendour
as
is
still
remembered
in
our
songs'
he
rose
and
standing
in
the
dark
he
began
to
chant
in
a
deep
voice
while
the
echoes
ran
away
into
the
roof

the
world
was
young
the
mountains
green

no
stain
yet
on
the
moon
was
seen

no
words
were
laid
on
stream
or
stone

when
durin
woke
and
walked
alone

he
named
the
nameless
hills
and
dells

he
drank
from
yet
untasted
wells

he
stooped
and
looked
in
mirrormere

and
saw
a
crown
of
stars
appear

as
gems
upon
a
silver
thread

above
the
shadow
of
his
head


the
world
was
fair
the
mountains
tall

in
elder
days
before
the
fall

of
mighty
kings
in
nargothrond

and
gondolin
who
now
beyond

the
western
seas
have
passed
away

the
world
was
fair
in
durin's
day


a
king
he
was
on
carven
throne

in
manypillared
halls
of
stone

with
golden
roof
and
silver
floor

and
runes
of
power
upon
the
door

the
light
of
sun
and
star
and
moon

in
shining
lamps
of
crystal
hewn

undimmed
by
cloud
or
shade
of
night

there
shone
for
ever
fair
and
bright


there
hammer
on
the
anvil
smote

there
chisel
clove
and
graver
wrote

there
forged
was
blade
and
bound
was
hilt

the
delver
mined
the
mason
built

there
beryl
pearl
and
opal
pale

and
metal
wrought
like
fishes'
mail

buckler
and
corslet
axe
and
sword

and
shining
spears
were
laid
in
hoard


unwearied
then
were
durin's
folk

beneath
the
mountains
music
woke

the
harpers
harped
the
minstrels
sang

and
at
the
gates
the
trumpets
rang


the
world
is
grey
the
mountains
old

the
forge's
fire
is
ashencold

no
harp
is
wrung
no
hammer
falls

the
darkness
dwells
in
durin's
halls

the
shadow
lies
upon
his
tomb

in
moria
in
khazaddm

but
still
the
sunken
stars
appear

in
dark
and
windless
mirrormere

there
lies
his
crown
in
water
deep

till
durin
wakes
again
from
sleep

I
like
that
'
said
sam
I
should
like
to
learn
it

in
moria
in
khazaddm

but
it
makes
the
darkness
seem
heavier
thinking
of
all
those
lamps
are
there
piles
of
jewels
and
gold
lying
about
here
still
'

gimli
was
silent
having
sung
his
song
he
would
say
no
more

piles
of
jewels
'
said
gandalf
no
the
orcs
have
often
plundered
moria
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
upper
halls
and
since
the
dwarves
fled
no
one
dares
to
seek
the
shafts
and
treasuries
down
in
the
deep
places
they
are
drowned
in
wateror
in
a
shadow
of
fear'

then
what
do
the
dwarves
want
to
come
back
for
'
asked
sam

'for

mithril
'
answered
gandalf
the
wealth
of
moria
was
not
in
gold
and
jewels
the
toys
of
the
dwarves
nor
in
iron
their
servant
such
things
they
found
here
it
is
true
especially
iron
but
they
did
not
need
to
delve
for
them
all
things
that
they
desired
they
could
obtain
in
traffic
for
here
alone
in
the
world
was
found
moriasilver
or
truesilver
as
some
have
called
it

mithril

is
the
elvish
name
the
dwarves
have
a
name
which
they
do
not
tell
its
worth
was
ten
times
that
of
gold
and
now
it
is
beyond
price
for
little
is
left
above
ground
and
even
the
orcs
dare
not
delve
here
for
it
the
lodes
lead
away
north
towards
caradhras
and
down
to
darkness
the
dwarves
tell
no
tale
but
even
as

mithril

was
the
foundation
of
their
wealth
so
also
it
was
their
destruction
they
delved
too
greedily
and
too
deep
and
disturbed
that
from
which
they
fled
durin's
bane
of
what
they
brought
to
light
the
orcs
have
gathered
nearly
all
and
given
it
in
tribute
to
sauron
who
covets
it


mithril

all
folk
desired
it
it
could
be
beaten
like
copper
and
polished
like
glass
and
the
dwarves
could
make
of
it
a
metal
light
and
yet
harder
than
tempered
steel
its
beauty
was
like
to
that
of
common
silver
but
the
beauty
of

mithril

did
not
tarnish
or
grow
dim
the
elves
dearly
loved
it
and
among
many
uses
they
made
of
it

ithildin

starmoon
which
you
saw
upon
the
doors
bilbo
had
a
corslet
of
mithrilrings
that
thorin
gave
him
I
wonder
what
has
become
of
it
gathering
dust
still
in
michel
delving
mathomhouse
I
suppose'

what
'
cried
gimli
startled
out
of
his
silence
a
corslet
of
moriasilver
that
was
a
kingly
gift
'

'yes'
said
gandalf
I
never
told
him
but
its
worth
was
greater
than
the
value
of
the
whole
shire
and
everything
in
it'

frodo
said
nothing
but
he
put
his
hand
under
his
tunic
and
touched
the
rings
of
his
mailshirt
he
felt
staggered
to
think
that
he
had
been
walking
about
with
the
price
of
the
shire
under
his
jacket
had
bilbo
known
he
felt
no
doubt
that
bilbo
knew
quite
well
it
was
indeed
a
kingly
gift
but
now
his
thoughts
had
been
carried
away
from
the
dark
mines
to
rivendell
to
bilbo
and
to
bag
end
in
the
days
while
bilbo
was
still
there
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
was
back
there
and
in
those
days
mowing
the
lawn
or
pottering
among
the
flowers
and
that
he
had
never
heard
of
moria
or

mithril

or
the
ring

a
deep
silence
fell
one
by
one
the
others
fell
asleep
frodo
was
on
guard
as
if
it
were
a
breath
that
came
in
through
unseen
doors
out
of
deep
places
dread
came
over
him
his
hands
were
cold
and
his
brow
damp
he
listened
all
his
mind
was
given
to
listening
and
nothing
else
for
two
slow
hours
but
he
heard
no
sound
not
even
the
imagined
echo
of
a
footfall


his
watch
was
nearly
over
when
far
off
where
he
guessed
that
the
western
archway
stood
he
fancied
that
he
could
see
two
pale
points
of
light
almost
like
luminous
eyes
he
started
his
head
had
nodded
I
must
have
nearly
fallen
asleep
on
guard'
he
thought
I
was
on
the
edge
of
a
dream'
he
stood
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
remained
standing
peering
into
the
dark
until
he
was
relieved
by
legolas

when
he
lay
down
he
quickly
went
to
sleep
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
dream
went
on
he
heard
whispers
and
saw
the
two
pale
points
of
light
approaching
slowly
he
woke
and
found
that
the
others
were
speaking
softly
near
him
and
that
a
dim
light
was
falling
on
his
face
high
up
above
the
eastern
archway
through
a
shaft
near
the
roof
came
a
long
pale
gleam
and
across
the
hall
through
the
northern
arch
light
also
glimmered
faint
and
distantly

frodo
sat
up
good
morning
'
said
gandalf
for
morning
it
is
again
at
last
I
was
right
you
see
we
are
high
up
on
the
east
side
of
moria
before
today
is
over
we
ought
to
find
the
great
gates
and
see
the
waters
of
mirrormere
lying
in
the
dimrill
dale
before
us'

'i
shall
be
glad'
said
gimli
I
have
looked
on
moria
and
it
is
very
great
but
it
has
become
dark
and
dreadful
and
we
have
found
no
sign
of
my
kindred
I
doubt
now
that
balin
ever
came
here'

after
they
had
breakfasted
gandalf
decided
to
go
on
again
at
once
we
are
tired
but
we
shall
rest
better
when
we
are
outside'
he
said
I
think
that
none
of
us
will
wish
to
spend
another
night
in
moria'

no
indeed
'
said
boromir
which
way
shall
we
take
yonder
eastward
arch
'

'maybe'
said
gandalf
but
I
du
not
know
yet
exactly
where
we
are
unless
I
am
quite
astray
I
guess
that
we
are
above
and
to
the
north
of
the
great
gates
and
it
may
not
be
easy
to
find
the
right
road
down
to
them
the
eastern
arch
will
probably
prove
to
be
the
way
that
we
must
take
but
before
we
make
up
our
minds
we
ought
to
look
about
us
let
us
go
towards
that
light
in
the
north
door
if
we
could
find
a
window
it
would
help
but
I
fear
that
the
light
comes
only
down
deep
shafts'

following
his
lead
the
company
passed
under
the
northern
arch
they
found
themselves
in
a
wide
corridor
as
they
went
along
it
the
glimmer
grew
stronger
and
they
saw
that
it
came
through
a
doorway
on
their
right
it
was
high
and
flattopped
and
the
stone
door
was
still
upon
its
hinges
standing
half
open
beyond
it
was
a
large
square
chamber
it
was
dimly
lit
but
to
their
eyes
after
so
long
a
time
in
the
dark
it
seemed
dazzlingly
bright
and
they
blinked
as
they
entered

their
feet
disturbed
a
deep
dust
upon
the
floor
and
stumbled
among
things
lying
in
the
doorway
whose
shapes
they
could
not
at
first
make
out
the
chamber
was
lit
by
a
wide
shaft
high
in
the
further
eastern
wall
it
slanted
upwards
and
far
above
a
small
square
patch
of
blue
sky
could
be
seen
the
light
of
the
shaft
fell
directly
on
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
single
oblong
block
about
two
feet
high
upon
which
was
laid
a
great
slab
of
white
stone

it
looks
like
a
tomb'
muttered
frodo
and
bent
forwards
with
a
curious
sense
of
foreboding
to
look
more
closely
at
it
gandalf
came
quickly
to
his
side
on
the
slab
runes
were
deeply
graven

'these
are
daeron's
runes
such
as
were
used
of
old
in
moria'
said
gandalf
'here
is
written
in
the
tongues
of
men
and
dwarves

balin
son
of
fundin

lord
of
moria'

'he
is
dead
then'
said
frodo
I
feared
it
was
so'
gimli
cast
his
hood
over
his
face


chapter
5


the
bridge
of
khazaddm



the
company
of
the
ring
stood
silent
beside
the
tomb
of
balin
frodo
thought
of
bilbo
and
his
long
friendship
with
the
dwarf
and
of
balin's
visit
to
the
shire
long
ago
in
that
dusty
chamber
in
the
mountains
it
seemed
a
thousand
years
ago
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
world

at
length
they
stirred
and
looked
up
and
began
to
search
for
anything
that
would
give
them
tidings
of
balin's
fate
or
show
what
had
become
of
his
folk
there
was
another
smaller
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
under
the
shaft
by
both
the
doors
they
could
now
see
that
many
bones
were
lying
and
among
them
were
broken
swords
and
axeheads
and
cloven
shields
and
helms
some
of
the
swords
were
crooked
orcscimitars
with
blackened
blades

there
were
many
recesses
cut
in
the
rock
of
the
walls
and
in
them
were
large
ironbound
chests
of
wood
all
had
been
broken
and
plundered
but
beside
the
shattered
lid
of
one
there
lay
the
remains
of
a
book
it
had
been
slashed
and
stabbed
and
partly
burned
and
it
was
so
stained
with
black
and
other
dark
marks
like
old
blood
that
little
of
it
could
be
read
gandalf
lifted
it
carefully
but
the
leaves
crackled
and
broke
as
he
laid
it
on
the
slab
he
pored
over
it
for
some
time
without
speaking
frodo
and
gimli
standing
at
his
side
could
see
as
he
gingerly
turned
the
leaves
that
they
were
written
by
many
different
hands
in
runes
both
of
moria
and
of
dale
and
here
and
there
in
elvish
script

at
last
gandalf
looked
up
'it
seems
to
be
a
record
of
the
fortunes
of
balin's
folk'
he
said
I
guess
that
it
began
with
their
coming
to
dimrill
dale
nigh
on
thirty
years
ago
the
pages
seem
to
have
numbers
referring
to
the
years
after
their
arrival
the
top
page
is
marked

one

three

so
at
least
two
are
missing
from
the
beginning
listen
to
this

'
we
drove
out
orcs
from
the
great
gate
and
guard


I
think
the
next
word
is
blurred
and
burned
probably

room



we
slew
many
in
the
bright


I
think


sun
in
the
dale
fli
was
killed
by
an
arrow
he
slew
the
great

then
there
is
a
blur
followed
by

fli
under
grass
near
mirror
mere

the
next
line
or
two
I
cannot
read
then
comes

we
have
taken
the
twentyfirst
hall
of
north
end
to
dwell
in
there
is
I
cannot
read
what
a

shaft

is
mentioned
then

balin
has
set
up
his
seat
in
the
chamber
of
mazarbul
'

'the
chamber
of
records'
said
gimli
I
guess
that
is
where
we
now
stand'

well
I
can
read
no
more
for
a
long
way'
said
gandalf
'except
the
word

gold

and

durin's
axe

and
something

helm

then

balin
is
now
lord
of
moria

that
seems
to
end
a
chapter
after
some
stars
another
hand
begins
and
I
can
see

we
found
truesilver

and
later
the
word

wellforged

and
then
something
I
have
it

mithril

and
the
last
two
lines

in
to
seek
for
the
upper
armouries
of
third
deep

something

go
westwards

a
blur

to
hollin
gate
'

gandalf
paused
and
set
a
few
leaves
aside
'there
are
several
pages
of
the
same
sort
rather
hastily
written
and
much
damaged
he
said
but
I
can
make
little
of
them
in
this
light
now
there
must
be
a
number
of
leaves
missing
because
they
begin
to
be
numbered

five

the
fifth
year
of
the
colony
I
suppose
let
me
see
no
they
are
too
cut
and
stained
I
cannot
read
them
we
might
do
better
in
the
sunlight
wait
here
is
something
a
large
bold
hand
using
an
elvish
script'

'that
would
be
ori's
hand'
said
gimli
looking
over
the
wizard's
arm
he
could
write
well
and
speedily
and
often
used
the
elvish
characters'

I
fear
he
had
ill
tidings
to
record
in
a
fair
hand'
said
gandalf
'the
first
clear
word
is

sorrow

but
the
rest
of
the
line
is
lost
unless
it
ends
in

estre

yes
it
must
be

yestre

followed
by

day
being
the
tenth
of
novembre
balin
lord
of
moria
fell
in
dimrill
dale
he
went
alone
to
look
in
mirror
mere
an
orc
shot
him
from
behind
a
stone
we
slew
the
orc
hut
many
more

up
from
east
up
the
silverlode

the
remainder
of
the
page
is
so
blurred
that
I
can
hardly
make
anything
out
but
I
think
I
can
read

we
have
barred
the
gates

and
then

can
hold
them
long
if

and
then
perhaps

horrible

and

suffer

poor
balin
he
seems
to
have
kept
the
title
that
he
took
for
less
than
five
years
I
wonder
what
happened
afterwards
but
there
is
no
time
to
puzzle
out
the
last
few
pages
here
is
the
last
page
of
all'
he
paused
and
sighed


it
is
grim
reading'
he
said
'i
fear
their
end
was
cruel
listen

we
cannot
get
out
we
cannot
get
out
they
have
taken
the
bridge
and
second
hall
frr
and
lni
and
nli
fell
there

then
there
are
four
lines
smeared
so
that
I
can
only

read
went
5
days
ago

the
last
lines

run
the
pool
is
up
to
the
wall
at
westgate
the
watcher
in
the
water
took
in
we
cannot
get
out
the
end
comes

and
then

drums
drums
in
the
deep

I
wonder
what
that
means
the
last
thing
written
is
in
a
trailing
scrawl
of
elfletters

they
are
coming

there
is
nothing
more'
gandalf
paused
and
stood
in
silent
thought

a
sudden
dread
and
a
horror
of
the
chamber
fell
on
the
company

we
cannot
get
out
'
muttered
gimli
'it
was
well
for
us
that
the
pool
had
sunk
a
little
and
that
the
watcher
was
sleeping
down
at
the
southern
end'

gandalf
raised
his
head
and
looked
round
they
seem
to
have
made
a
last
stand
by
both
doors'
he
said
'but
there
were
not
many
left
by
that
time
so
ended
the
attempt
to
retake
moria
it
was
valiant
but
foolish
the
time
is
not
come
yet
now
I
fear
we
must
say
farewell
to
balin
son
of
fundin
here
he
must
lie
in
the
halls
of
his
fathers
we
will
take
this
book
the
book
of
mazarbul
and
look
at
it
more
closely
later
you
had
better
keep
it
gimli
and
take
it
back
to
din
if
you
get
a
chance
it
will
interest
him
though
it
will
grieve
him
deeply
come
let
us
go
the
morning
is
passing'

'which
way
shall
we
go
'
asked
boromir

'back
to
the
hall'
answered
gandalf
'but
our
visit
to
this
room
has
not
been
in
vain
I
now
know
where
we
are
this
must
be
as
gimli
says
the
chamber
of
mazarbul
and
the
hall
must
be
the
twentyfirst
of
the
northend
therefore
we
should
leave
by
the
eastern
arch
of
the
hall
and
bear
right
and
south
and
go
downwards
the
twentyfirst
hall
should
be
on
the
seventh
level
that
is
six
above
the
level
of
the
gates
come
now
back
to
the
hall
'

gandalf
had
hardly
spoken
these
words
when
there
came
a
great
noise
a
rolling

boom

that
seemed
to
come
from
depths
far
below
and
to
tremble
in
the
stone
at
their
feet
they
sprang
towards
the
door
in
alarm

doom
doom

it
rolled
again
as
if
huge
hands
were
turning
the
very
caverns
of
moria
into
a
vast
drum
then
there
came
an
echoing
blast
a
great
horn
was
blown
in
the
hall
and
answering
horns
and
harsh
cries
were
heard
further
off
there
was
a
hurrying
sound
of
many
feet

they
are
coming
'
cried
legolas

'we
cannot
get
out'
said
gimli

trapped
'
cried
gandalf
why
did
I
delay
here
we
are
caught
just
as
they
were
before
but
I
was
not
here
then
we
will
see
what
'


doom
doom

came
the
drumbeat
and
the
walls
shook

'slam
the
doors
and
wedge
them
'
shouted
aragorn
'and
keep
your
packs
on
as
long
as
you
can
we
may
get
a
chance
to
cut
our
way
out
yet'

no
'
said
gandalf
'we
must
not
get
shut
in
keep
the
east
door
ajar
we
will
go
that
way
if
we
get
a
chance'

another
harsh
horncall
and
shrill
cries
rang
out
feet
were
coming
down
the
corridor
there
was
a
ring
and
clatter
as
the
company
drew
their
swords
glamdring
shone
with
a
pale
light
and
sting
glinted
at
the
edges
boromir
set
his
shoulder
against
the
western
door

wait
a
moment
do
not
close
it
yet
'
said
gandalf
he
sprang
forward
to
boromir's
side
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height

'who
comes
hither
to
disturb
the
rest
of
balin
lord
of
moria
'
he
cried
in
a
loud
voice

there
was
a
rush
of
hoarse
laughter
like
the
fall
of
sliding
stones
into
a
pit
amid
the
clamour
a
deep
voice
was
raised
in
command
doom
boom
doom
went
the
drums
in
the
deep

with
a
quick
movement
gandalf
stepped
before
the
narrow
opening
of
the
door
and
thrust
forward
his
staff
there
was
a
dazzling
flash
that
lit
the
chamber
and
the
passage
outside
for
an
instant
the
wizard
looked
out
arrows
whined
and
whistled
down
the
corridor
as
he
sprang
back


'there
are
orcs
very
many
of
them'
he
said
and
some
are
large
and
evil
black
uruks
of
mordor
for
the
moment
they
are
hanging
back
but
there
is
something
else
there
a
great
cavetroll
I
think
or
more
than
one
there
is
no
hope
of
escape
that
way'

'and
no
hope
at
all
if
they
come
at
the
other
door
as
well'
said
boromir

'there
is
no
sound
outside
here
yet'
said
aragorn
who
was
standing
by
the
eastern
door
listening
the
passage
on
this
side
plunges
straight
down
a
stair
it
plainly
does
not
lead
back
towards
the
hall
but
it
is
no
good
flying
blindly
this
way
with
the
pursuit
just
behind
we
cannot
block
the
door
its
key
is
gone
and
the
lock
is
broken
and
it
opens
inwards
we
must
do
something
to
delay
the
enemy
first
we
will
make
them
fear
the
chamber
of
mazarbul'
he
said
grimly
feeling
the
edge
of
his
sword
andril

heavy
feet
were
heard
in
the
corridor
boromir
flung
himself
against
the
door
and
heaved
it
to
then
he
wedged
it
with
broken
swordblades
and
splinters
of
wood
the
company
retreated
to
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
but
they
had
no
chance
to
fly
yet
there
was
a
blow
on
the
door
that
made
it
quiver
and
then
it
began
to
grind
slowly
open
driving
back
the
wedges
a
huge
arm
and
shoulder
with
a
dark
skin
of
greenish
scales
was
thrust
through
the
widening
gap
then
a
great
flat
toeless
foot
was
forced
through
below
there
was
a
dead
silence
outside

boromir
leaped
forward
and
hewed
at
the
arm
with
all
his
might
but
his
sword
rang
glanced
aside
and
fell
from
his
shaken
hand
the
blade
was
notched

suddenly
and
to
his
own
surprise
frodo
felt
a
hot
wrath
blaze
up
in
his
heart
the
shire
'
he
cried
and
springing
beside
boromir
he
stooped
and
stabbed
with
sting
at
the
hideous
foot
there
was
a
bellow
and
the
foot
jerked
back
nearly
wrenching
sting
from
frodo's
arm
black
drops
dripped
from
the
blade
and
smoked
on
the
floor
boromir
hurled
himself
against
the
door
and
slammed
it
again

one
for
the
shire
'
cried
aragorn
the
hobbit's
bite
is
deep
you
have
a
good
blade
frodo
son
of
drogo
'

there
was
a
crash
on
the
door
followed
by
crash
after
crash
rams
and
hammers
were
beating
against
it
it
cracked
and
staggered
back
and
the
opening
grew
suddenly
wide
arrows
came
whistling
in
but
struck
the
northern
wall
and
fell
harmlessly
to
the
floor
there
was
a
hornblast
and
a
rush
of
feet
and
orcs
one
after
another
leaped
into
the
chamber

how
many
there
were
the
company
could
not
count
the
affray
was
sharp
but
the
orcs
were
dismayed
by
the
fierceness
of
the
defence
legolas
shot
two
through
the
throat
gimli
hewed
the
legs
from
under
another
that
had
sprung
up
on
balin's
tomb
boromir
and
aragorn
slew
many
when
thirteen
had
fallen
the
rest
fled
shrieking
leaving
the
defenders
unharmed
except
for
sam
who
had
a
scratch
along
the
scalp
a
quick
duck
had
saved
him
and
he
had
felled
his
orc
a
sturdy
thrust
with
his
barrowblade
a
fire
was
smouldering
in
his
brown
eyes
that
would
have
made
ted
sandyman
step
backwards
if
he
had
seen
it

now
is
the
time
'
cried
gandalf
let
us
go
before
the
troll
returns'

but
even
as
they
retreated
and
before
pippin
and
merry
had
reached
the
stair
outside
a
huge
orcchieftain
almost
manhigh
clad
in
black
mail
from
head
to
foot
leaped
into
the
chamber
behind
him
his
followers
clustered
in
the
doorway
his
broad
flat
face
was
swart
his
eyes
were
like
coals
and
his
tongue
was
red
he
wielded
a
great
spear
with
a
thrust
of
his
huge
hide
shield
he
turned
boromir's
sword
and
bore
him
backwards
throwing
him
to
the
ground
diving
under
aragorn's
blow
with
the
speed
of
a
striking
snake
he
charged
into
the
company
and
thrust
with
his
spear
straight
at
frodo
the
blow
caught
him
on
the
right
side
and
frodo
was
hurled
against
the
wall
and
pinned
sam
with
a
cry
hacked
at
the
spearshaft
and
it
broke
but
even
as
the
orc
flung
down
the
truncheon
and
swept
out
his
scimitar
andril
came
down
upon
his
helm
there
was
a
flash
like
flame
and
the
helm
burst
asunder
the
orc
fell
with
cloven
head
his
followers
fled
howling
as
boromir
and
aragorn
sprang
at
them


doom
doom

went
the
drums
in
the
deep
the
great
voice
rolled
out
again


'now
'
shouted
gandalf
'now
is
the
last
chance
run
for
it
'

aragorn
picked
up
frodo
where
he
lay
by
the
wall
and
made
for
the
stair
pushing
merry
and
pippin
in
front
of
him
the
others
followed
but
gimli
had
to
be
dragged
away
by
legolas
in
spite
of
the
peril
he
lingered
by
balin's
tomb
with
his
head
bowed
boromir
hauled
the
eastern
door
to
grinding
upon
its
hinges
it
had
great
iron
rings
on
either
side
but
could
not
be
fastened

'i
am
all
right'
gasped
frodo
I
can
walk
put
me
down
'

aragorn
nearly
dropped
him
in
his
amazement
'i
thought
you
were
dead
'
he
cried

'not
yet
'
said
gandalf
'but
there
is
time
for
wonder
off
you
go
all
of
you
down
the
stairs
wait
a
few
minutes
for
me
at
the
bottom
but
if
I
do
not
come
soon
go
on
go
quickly
and
choose
paths
leading
right
and
downwards'

'we
cannot
leave
you
to
hold
the
door
alone
'
said
aragorn

do
as
I
say
'
said
gandalf
fiercely
swords
are
no
more
use
here
go'

the
passage
was
lit
by
no
shaft
and
was
utterly
dark
they
groped
their
way
down
a
long
flight
of
steps
and
then
looked
back
but
they
could
see
nothing
except
high
above
them
the
faint
glimmer
of
the
wizard's
staff
he
seemed
to
be
still
standing
on
guard
by
the
closed
door
frodo
breathed
heavily
and
leaned
against
sam
who
put
his
arms
about
him
they
stood
peering
up
the
stairs
into
the
darkness
frodo
thought
he
could
hear
the
voice
of
gandalf
above
muttering
words
that
ran
down
the
sloping
roof
with
a
sighing
echo
he
could
not
catch
what
was
said
the
walls
seemed
to
be
trembling
every
now
and
again
the
drumbeats
throbbed
and
rolled

doom
doom


suddenly
at
the
top
of
the
stair
there
was
a
stab
of
white
light
then
there
was
a
dull
rumble
and
a
heavy
thud
the
drumbeats
broke
out
wildly

doomboom
doomboom

and
then
stopped
gandalf
came
flying
down
the
steps
and
fell
to
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
the
company

well
well
that's
over
'
said
the
wizard
struggling
to
his
feet
I
have
done
all
that
I
could
but
I
have
met
my
match
and
have
nearly
been
destroyed
but
don't
stand
here
go
on
you
will
have
to
do
without
light
for
a
while
I
am
rather
shaken
go
on
go
on
where
are
you
gimli
come
ahead
with
me
keep
close
behind
all
of
you'

they
stumbled
after
him
wondering
what
had
happened

doom
doom

went
the
drumbeats
again
they
now
sounded
muffled
and
far
away
but
they
were
following
there
was
no
other
sound
of
pursuit
neither
tramp
of
feet
nor
any
voice
gandalf
took
no
turns
right
or
left
for
the
passage
seemed
to
be
going
in
the
direction
that
he
desired
every
now
and
again
it
descended
a
flight
of
steps
fifty
or
more
to
a
lower
level
at
the
moment
that
was
their
chief
danger
for
in
the
dark
they
could
not
see
a
descent
until
they
came
on
it
and
put
their
feet
out
into
emptiness
gandalf
felt
the
ground
with
his
staff
like
a
blind
man

at
the
end
of
an
hour
they
had
gone
a
mile
or
maybe
a
little
more
and
had
descended
many
flights
of
stairs
there
was
still
no
sound
of
pursuit
almost
they
began
to
hope
that
they
would
escape
at
the
bottom
of
the
seventh
flight
gandalf
halted

it
is
getting
hot
'
he
gasped
we
ought
to
be
down
at
least
to
the
level
of
the
gates
now
soon
I
think
we
should
look
for
a
lefthand
turn
to
take
us
east
I
hope
it
is
not
far
I
am
very
weary
I
must
rest
here
a
moment
even
if
all
the
orcs
ever
spawned
are
after
us'

gimli
took
his
arm
and
helped
him
down
to
a
seat
on
the
step
what
happened
away
up
there
at
the
door
'
he
asked
did
you
meet
the
beater
of
the
drums
'

'i
do
not
know'
answered
gandalf
but
I
found
myself
suddenly
faced
by
something
that
I
have
not
met
before
I
could
think
of
nothing
to
do
but
to
try
and
put
a
shuttingspell
on
the
door
I
know
many
but
to
do
things
of
that
kind
rightly
requires
time
and
even
then
the
door
can
be
broken
by
strength

as
I
stood
there
I
could
hear
orcvoices
on
the
other
side
at
any
moment
I
thought
they
would
burst
it
open
I
could
not
hear
what
was
said
they
seemed
to
be
talking
in
their
own
hideous
language
all
I
caught
was

ghsh

that
is
fire
then
something
came
into
the
chamber

I
felt
it
through
the
door
and
the
orcs
themselves
were
afraid
and
fell
silent
it
laid
hold
of
the
iron
ring
and
then
it
perceived
me
and
my
spell

'what
it
was
I
cannot
guess
but
I
have
never
felt
such
a
challenge
the
counterspell
was
terrible
it
nearly
broke
me
for
an
instant
the
door
left
my
control
and
began
to
open
I
had
to
speak
a
word
of
command
that
proved
too
great
a
strain
the
door
burst
in
pieces
something
dark
as
a
cloud
was
blocking
out
all
the
light
inside
and
I
was
thrown
backwards
down
the
stairs
all
the
wall
gave
way
and
the
roof
of
the
chamber
as
well
I
think

I
am
afraid
balin
is
buried
deep
and
maybe
something
else
is
buried
there
too
I
cannot
say
but
at
least
the
passage
behind
us
was
completely
blocked
ah
I
have
never
felt
so
spent
but
it
is
passing
and
now
what
about
you
frodo
there
was
not
time
to
say
so
but
I
have
never
been
more
delighted
in
my
life
than
when
you
spoke
I
feared
that
it
was
a
brave
but
dead
hobbit
that
aragorn
was
carrying'

what
about
me
'
said
frodo
'i
am
alive
and
whole
I
think
I
am
bruised
and
in
pain
but
it
is
not
too
bad'

well'
said
aragorn
I
can
only
say
that
hobbits
are
made
of
a
stuff
so
tough
that
I
have
never
met
the
like
of
it
had
I
known
I
would
have
spoken
softer
in
the
inn
at
bree
that
spearthrust
would
have
skewered
a
wild
boar
'

'well
it
did
not
skewer
me
I
am
glad
to
say'
said
frodo
though
I
feel
as
if
I
had
been
caught
between
a
hammer
and
an
anvil'
he
said
no
more
he
found
breathing
painful

'you
take
after
bilbo'
said
gandalf
there
is
more
about
you
than
meets
the
eye
as
I
said
of
him
long
ago'
frodo
wondered
if
the
remark
meant
more
than
it
said

they
now
went
on
again
before
long
gimli
spoke
he
had
keen
eyes
in
the
dark
I
think'
he
said
that
there
is
a
light
ahead
but
it
is
not
daylight
it
is
red
what
can
it
be
'


ghsh
'
muttered
gandalf
I
wonder
if
that
is
what
they
meant
that
the
lower
levels
are
on
fire
still
we
can
only
go
on'

soon
the
light
became
unmistakable
and
could
be
seen
by
all
it
was
flickering
and
glowing
on
the
walls
away
down
the
passage
before
them
they
could
now
see
their
way
in
front
the
road
sloped
down
swiftly
and
some
way
ahead
there
stood
a
low
archway
through
it
the
glowing
light
came
the
air
became
very
hot

when
they
came
to
the
arch
gandalf
went
through
signing
to
them
to
wait
as
he
stood
just
beyond
the
opening
they
saw
his
face
lit
by
a
red
glow
quickly
he
stepped
back

there
is
some
new
devilry
here'
he
said
'devised
for
our
welcome
no
doubt
but
I
know
now
where
we
are
we
have
reached
the
first
deep
the
level
immediately
below
the
gates
this
is
the
second
hall
of
old
moria
and
the
gates
are
near
away
beyond
the
eastern
end
on
the
left
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
the
bridge
up
a
broad
stair
along
a
wide
road
through
the
first
hall
and
out
but
come
and
look
'

they
peered
out
before
them
was
another
cavernous
hall
it
was
loftier
and
far
longer
than
the
one
in
which
they
had
slept
they
were
near
its
eastern
end
westward
it
ran
away
into
darkness
down
the
centre
stalked
a
double
line
of
towering
pillars
they
were
carved
like
boles
of
mighty
trees
whose
boughs
upheld
the
roof
with
a
branching
tracery
of
stone
their
stems
were
smooth
and
black
but
a
red
glow
was
darkly
mirrored
in
their
sides
right
across
the
floor
close
to
the
feet
of
two
huge
pillars
a
great
fissure
had
opened
out
of
it
a
fierce
red
light
came
and
now
and
again
flames
licked
at
the
brink
and
curled
about
the
bases
of
the
columns
wisps
of
dark
smoke
wavered
in
the
hot
air

'if
we
had
come
by
the
main
road
down
from
the
upper
halls
we
should
have
been
trapped
here'
said
gandalf
let
us
hope
that
the
fire
now
lies
between
us
and
pursuit
come
there
is
no
time
to
lose'


even
as
he
spoke
they
heard
again
the
pursuing
drumbeat

doom
doom
doom

away
beyond
the
shadows
at
the
western
end
of
the
hall
there
came
cries
and
horncalls

doom
doom

the
pillars
seemed
to
tremble
and
the
flames
to
quiver

now
for
the
last
race
'
said
gandalf
'if
the
sun
is
shining
outside
we
may
still
escape
after
me
'

he
turned
left
and
sped
across
the
smooth
floor
of
the
hall
the
distance
was
greater
than
it
had
looked
as
they
ran
they
heard
the
beat
and
echo
of
many
hurrying
feet
behind
a
shrill
yell
went
up
they
had
been
seen
there
was
a
ring
and
clash
of
steel
an
arrow
whistled
over
frodo's
head

boromir
laughed
they
did
not
expect
this'
he
said
the
fire
has
cut
them
off
we
are
on
the
wrong
side
'

look
ahead
'
called
gandalf
the
bridge
is
near
it
is
dangerous
and
narrow'

suddenly
frodo
saw
before
him
a
black
chasm
at
the
end
of
the
hall
the
floor
vanished
and
fell
to
an
unknown
depth
the
outer
door
could
only
be
reached
by
a
slender
bridge
of
stone
without
kerb
or
rail
that
spanned
the
chasm
with
one
curving
spring
of
fifty
feet
it
was
an
ancient
defence
of
the
dwarves
against
any
enemy
that
might
capture
the
first
hall
and
the
outer
passages
they
could
only
pass
across
it
in
single
file
at
the
brink
gandalf
halted
and
the
others
came
up
in
a
pack
behind

'lead
the
way
gimli
'
he
said
'pippin
and
merry
next
straight
on
and
up
the
stair
beyond
the
door
'

arrows
fell
among
them
one
struck
frodo
and
sprang
back
another
pierced
gandalf's
hat
and
stuck
there
like
a
black
feather
frodo
looked
behind
beyond
the
fire
he
saw
swarming
black
figures
there
seemed
to
be
hundreds
of
orcs
they
brandished
spears
and
scimitars
which
shone
red
as
blood
in
the
firelight

doom
doom

rolled
the
drumbeats
growing
louder
and
louder

doom
doom


legolas
turned
and
set
an
arrow
to
the
string
though
it
was
a
long
shot
for
his
small
bow
he
drew
but
his
hand
fell
and
the
arrow
slipped
to
the
ground
he
gave
a
cry
of
dismay
and
fear
two
great
trolls
appeared
they
bore
great
slabs
of
stone
and
flung
them
down
to
serve
as
gangways
over
the
fire
but
it
was
not
the
trolls
that
had
filled
the
elf
with
terror
the
ranks
of
the
orcs
had
opened
and
they
crowded
away
as
if
they
themselves
were
afraid
something
was
coming
up
behind
them
what
it
was
could
not
be
seen
it
was
like
a
great
shadow
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
dark
form
of
manshape
maybe
yet
greater
and
a
power
and
terror
seemed
to
be
in
it
and
to
go
before
it

it
came
to
the
edge
of
the
fire
and
the
light
faded
as
if
a
cloud
had
bent
over
it
then
with
a
rush
it
leaped
across
the
fissure
the
flames
roared
up
to
greet
it
and
wreathed
about
it
and
a
black
smoke
swirled
in
the
air
its
streaming
mane
kindled
and
blazed
behind
it
in
its
right
hand
was
a
blade
like
a
stabbing
tongue
of
fire
in
its
left
it
held
a
whip
of
many
thongs

'ai
ai
'
wailed
legolas
'a
balrog
a
balrog
is
come
'

gimli
stared
with
wide
eyes
durin's
bane
'
he
cried
and
letting
his
axe
fall
he
covered
his
face

'a
balrog'
muttered
gandalf
now
I
understand'
he
faltered
and
leaned
heavily
on
his
staff
what
an
evil
fortune
and
I
am
already
weary'

the
dark
figure
streaming
with
fire
raced
towards
them
the
orcs
yelled
and
poured
over
the
stone
gangways
then
boromir
raised
his
horn
and
blew
loud
the
challenge
rang
and
bellowed
like
the
shout
of
many
throats
under
the
cavernous
roof
for
a
moment
the
orcs
quailed
and
the
fiery
shadow
halted
then
the
echoes
died
as
suddenly
as
a
flame
blown
out
by
a
dark
wind
and
the
enemy
advanced
again

'over
the
bridge'
cried
gandalf
recalling
his
strength
fly
this
is
a
foe
beyond
any
of
you
I
must
hold
the
narrow
way
fly
'
aragorn
and
boromir
did
not
heed
the
command
but
still
held
their
ground
side
by
side
behind
gandalf
at
the
far
end
of
the
bridge
the
others
halted
just
within
the
doorway
at
the
hall's
end
and
turned
unable
to
leave
their
leader
to
face
the
enemy
alone

the
balrog
reached
the
bridge
gandalf
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
span
leaning
on
the
staff
in
his
left
hand
but
in
his
other
hand
glamdring
gleamed
cold
and
white
his
enemy
halted
again
facing
him
and
the
shadow
about
it
reached
out
like
two
vast
wings
it
raised
the
whip
and
the
thongs
whined
and
cracked
fire
came
from
its
nostrils
but
gandalf
stood
firm

you
cannot
pass'
he
said
the
orcs
stood
still
and
a
dead
silence
fell
I
am
a
servant
of
the
secret
fire
wielder
of
the
flame
of
anor
you
cannot
pass
the
dark
fire
will
not
avail
you
flame
of
udn
go
back
to
the
shadow
you
cannot
pass'

the
balrog
made
no
answer
the
fire
in
it
seemed
to
die
but
the
darkness
grew
it
stepped
forward
slowly
on
to
the
bridge
and
suddenly
it
drew
itself
up
to
a
great
height
and
its
wings
were
spread
from
wall
to
wall
but
still
gandalf
could
be
seen
glimmering
in
the
gloom
he
seemed
small
and
altogether
alone
grey
and
bent
like
a
wizened
tree
before
the
onset
of
a
storm

from
out
of
the
shadow
a
red
sword
leaped
flaming

glamdring
glittered
white
in
answer

there
was
a
ringing
clash
and
a
stab
of
white
fire
the
balrog
fell
back
and
its
sword
flew
up
in
molten
fragments
the
wizard
swayed
on
the
bridge
stepped
back
a
pace
and
then
again
stood
still

'you
cannot
pass
'
he
said

with
a
bound
the
balrog
leaped
full
upon
the
bridge
its
whip
whirled
and
hissed

'he
cannot
stand
alone
'
cried
aragorn
suddenly
and
ran
back
along
the
bridge
'
elendil
'
he
shouted
'i
am
with
you
gandalf
'

gondor
'
cried
boromir
and
leaped
after
him

at
that
moment
gandalf
lifted
his
staff
and
crying
aloud
he
smote
the
bridge
before
him
the
staff
broke
asunder
and
fell
from
his
hand
a
blinding
sheet
of
white
flame
sprang
up
the
bridge
cracked
right
at
the
balrog's
feet
it
broke
and
the
stone
upon
which
it
stood
crashed
into
the
gulf
while
the
rest
remained
poised
quivering
like
a
tongue
of
rock
thrust
out
into
emptiness

with
a
terrible
cry
the
balrog
fell
forward
and
its
shadow
plunged
down
and
vanished
but
even
as
it
fell
it
swung
its
whip
and
the
thongs
lashed
and
curled
about
the
wizard's
knees
dragging
him
to
the
brink
he
staggered
and
fell
grasped
vainly
at
the
stone
and
slid
into
the
abyss
'fly
you
fools
'
he
cried
and
was
gone

the
fires
went
out
and
blank
darkness
fell
the
company
stood
rooted
with
horror
staring
into
the
pit
even
as
aragorn
and
boromir
came
flying
back
the
rest
of
the
bridge
cracked
and
fell
with
a
cry
aragorn
roused
them

'come
I
will
lead
you
now
'
he
called
'we
must
obey
his
last
command
follow
me
'

they
stumbled
wildly
up
the
great
stairs
beyond
the
door
aragorn
leading
boromir
at
the
rear
at
the
top
was
a
wide
echoing
passage
along
this
they
fled
frodo
heard
sam
at
his
side
weeping
and
then
he
found
that
he
himself
was
weeping
as
he
ran

doom
doom
doom

the
drumbeats
rolled
behind
mournful
now
and
slow

doom


they
ran
on
the
light
grew
before
them
great
shafts
pierced
the
roof
they
ran
swifter
they
passed
into
a
hall
bright
with
daylight
from
its
high
windows
in
the
east
they
fled
across
it
through
its
huge
broken
doors
they
passed
and
suddenly
before
them
the
great
gates
opened
an
arch
of
blazing
light

there
was
a
guard
of
orcs
crouching
in
the
shadows
behind
the
great
door
posts
towering
on
either
side
but
the
gates
were
shattered
and
cast
down
aragorn
smote
to
the
ground
the
captain
that
stood
in
his
path
and
the
rest
fled
in
terror
of
his
wrath
the
company
swept
past
them
and
took
no
heed
of
them
out
of
the
gates
they
ran
and
sprang
down
the
huge
and
ageworn
steps
the
threshold
of
moria

thus
at
last
they
came
beyond
hope
under
the
sky
and
felt
the
wind
on
their
faces


they
did
not
halt
until
they
were
out
of
bowshot
from
the
walls
dimrill
dale
lay
about
them
the
shadow
of
the
misty
mountains
lay
upon
it
but
eastwards
there
was
a
golden
light
on
the
land
it
was
but
one
hour
after
noon
the
sun
was
shining
the
clouds
were
white
and
high

they
looked
back
dark
yawned
the
archway
of
the
gates
under
the
mountainshadow
faint
and
far
beneath
the
earth
rolled
the
slow
drumbeats

doom

a
thin
black
smoke
trailed
out
nothing
else
was
to
be
seen
the
dale
all
around
was
empty

doom

grief
at
last
wholly
overcame
them
and
they
wept
long
some
standing
and
silent
some
cast
upon
the
ground

doom
doom

the
drumbeats
faded

lothlrien


'alas
I
fear
we
cannot
stay
here
longer'
said
aragorn
he
looked
towards
the
mountains
and
held
up
his
sword
farewell
gandalf
'
he
cried
'did
I
not
say
to
you

if
you
pass
the
doors
of
moria
beware

alas
that
I
spoke
true
what
hope
have
we
without
you
'

he
turned
to
the
company
we
must
do
without
hope'
he
said
at
least
we
may
yet
be
avenged
let
us
gird
ourselves
and
weep
no
more
come
we
have
a
long
road
and
much
to
do'

they
rose
and
looked
about
them
northward
the
dale
ran
up
into
a
glen
of
shadows
between
two
great
arms
of
the
mountains
above
which
three
white
peaks
were
shining
celebdil
fanuidhol
caradhras
the
mountains
of
moria
at
the
head
of
the
glen
a
torrent
flowed
like
a
white
lace
over
an
endless
ladder
of
short
falls
and
a
mist
of
foam
hung
in
the
air
about
the
mountains'
feet

yonder
is
the
dimrill
stair'
said
aragorn
pointing
to
the
falls
'down
the
deepcloven
way
that
climbs
beside
the
torrent
we
should
have
come
if
fortune
had
been
kinder'

or
caradhras
less
cruel'
said
gimli
there
he
stands
smiling
in
the
sun
'
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
furthest
of
the
snowcapped
peaks
and
turned
away

to
the
east
the
outflung
arm
of
the
mountains
marched
to
a
sudden
end
and
far
lands
could
be
descried
beyond
them
wide
and
vague
to
the
south
the
misty
mountains
receded
endlessly
as
far
as
sight
could
reach
less
than
a
mile
away
and
a
little
below
them
for
they
still
stood
high
up
on
the
west
side
of
the
dale
there
lay
a
mere
it
was
long
and
oval
shaped
like
a
great
spearhead
thrust
deep
into
the
northern
glen
but
its
southern
end
was
beyond
the
shadows
under
the
sunlit
sky
yet
its
waters
were
dark
a
deep
blue
like
clear
evening
sky
seen
from
a
lamplit
room
its
face
was
still
and
unruffled
about
it
lay
a
smooth
sward
shelving
down
on
all
sides
to
its
bare
unbroken
rim

there
lies
the
mirrormere
deep
kheledzram
'
said
gimli
sadly
I
remember
that
he
said
may
you
have
joy
of
the
sight
but
we
cannot
linger
there
now
long
shall
I
journey
ere
I
have
joy
again
it
is
I
that
must
hasten
away
and
he
that
must
remain'

the
company
now
went
down
the
road
from
the
gates
it
was
rough
and
broken
fading
to
a
winding
track
between
heather
and
whin
that
thrust
amid
the
cracking
stones
but
still
it
could
be
seen
that
once
long
ago
a
great
paved
way
had
wound
upwards
from
the
lowlands
of
the
dwarfkingdom
in
places
there
were
ruined
works
of
stone
beside
the
path
and
mounds
of
green
topped
with
slender
birches
or
firtrees
sighing
in
the
wind
an
eastward
bend
led
them
hard
by
the
sward
of
mirrormere
and
there
not
far
from
the
roadside
stood
a
single
column
broken
at
the
top

'that
is
durin's
stone
'
cried
gimli
I
cannot
pass
without
turning
aside
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
wonder
of
the
dale
'

be
swift
then
'
said
aragorn
looking
back
towards
the
gates
the
sun
sinks
early
the
orcs
will
not
maybe
come
out
till
after
dusk
but
we
must
be
far
away
before
nightfall
the
moon
is
almost
spent
and
it
will
be
dark
tonight'


'come
with
me
frodo
'
cried
the
dwarf
springing
from
the
road
I
would
not
have
you
go
without
seeing
kheledzram'
he
ran
down
the
long
green
slope
frodo
followed
slowly
drawn
by
the
still
blue
water
in
spite
of
hurt
and
weariness
sam
came
up
behind

beside
the
standing
stone
gimli
halted
and
looked
up
it
was
cracked
and
weatherworn
and
the
faint
runes
upon
its
side
could
not
be
read
this
pillar
marks
the
spot
where
durin
first
looked
in
the
mirrormere'
said
the
dwarf
'let
us
look
ourselves
once
ere
we
go'

they
stooped
over
the
dark
water
at
first
they
could
see
nothing
then
slowly
they
saw
the
forms
of
the
encircling
mountains
mirrored
in
a
profound
blue
and
the
peaks
were
like
plumes
of
white
flame
above
them
beyond
there
was
a
space
of
sky
there
like
jewels
sunk
in
the
deep
shone
glinting
stars
though
sunlight
was
in
the
sky
above
of
their
own
stooping
forms
no
shadow
could
be
seen

'o
kheledzram
fair
and
wonderful
'
said
gimli
there
lies
the
crown
of
durin
till
he
wakes
farewell
'
he
bowed
and
turned
away
and
hastened
back
up
the
greensward
to
the
road
again

what
did
you
see
'
said
pippin
to
sam
but
sam
was
too
deep
in
thought
to
answer

the
road
now
turned
south
and
went
quickly
downwards
running
out
from
between
the
arms
of
the
dale
some
way
below
the
mere
they
came
on
a
deep
well
of
water
clear
as
crystal
from
which
a
freshet
fell
over
a
stone
lip
and
ran
glistening
and
gurgling
down
a
steep
rocky
channel

'here
is
the
spring
from
which
the
silverlode
rises'
said
gimli
do
not
drink
of
it
it
is
icy
cold'

'soon
it
becomes
a
swift
river
and
it
gathers
water
from
many
other
mountainstreams'
said
aragorn
our
road
leads
beside
it
for
many
miles
for
I
shall
take
you
by
the
road
that
gandalf
chose
and
first
I
hope
to
come
to
the
woods
where
the
silverlode
flows
into
the
great
riverout
yonder'
they
looked
as
he
pointed
and
before
them
they
could
see
the
stream
leaping
down
to
the
trough
of
the
valley
and
then
running
on
and
away
into
the
lower
lands
until
it
was
lost
in
a
golden
haze

there
lie
the
woods
of
lothlrien
'
said
legolas
that
is
the
fairest
of
all
the
dwellings
of
my
people
there
are
no
trees
like
the
trees
of
that
land
for
in
the
autumn
their
leaves
fall
not
but
turn
to
gold
not
till
the
spring
comes
and
the
new
green
opens
do
they
fall
and
then
the
boughs
are
laden
with
yellow
flowers
and
the
floor
of
the
wood
is
golden
and
golden
is
the
roof
and
its
pillars
are
of
silver
for
the
bark
of
the
trees
is
smooth
and
grey
so
still
our
songs
in
mirkwood
say
my
heart
would
be
glad
if
I
were
beneath
the
eaves
of
that
wood
and
it
were
springtime
'

my
heart
will
be
glad
even
in
the
winter'
said
aragorn
'but
it
lies
many
miles
away
let
us
hasten
'

for
some
time
frodo
and
sam
managed
to
keep
up
with
the
others
but
aragorn
was
leading
them
at
a
great
pace
and
after
a
while
they
lagged
behind
they
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
early
morning
sam's
cut
was
burning
like
fire
and
his
head
felt
light
in
spite
of
the
shining
sun
the
wind
seemed
chill
after
the
warm
darkness
of
moria
he
shivered
frodo
felt
every
step
more
painful
and
he
gasped
for
breath

at
last
legolas
turned
and
seeing
them
now
far
behind
he
spoke
to
aragorn
the
others
halted
and
aragorn
ran
back
calling
to
boromir
to
come
with
him

'i
am
sorry
frodo
'
he
cried
full
of
concern
so
much
has
happened
this
day
and
we
have
such
need
of
haste
that
I
have
forgotten
that
you
were
hurt
and
sam
too
you
should
have
spoken
we
have
done
nothing
to
ease
you
as
we
ought
though
all
the
orcs
of
moria
were
after
us
come
now
a
little
further
on
there
is
a
place
where
we
can
rest
for
a
little
there
I
will
do
what
I
can
for
you
come
boromir
we
will
carry
them'

soon
afterwards
they
came
upon
another
stream
that
ran
down
from
the
west
and
joined
its
bubbling
water
with
the
hurrying
silverlode
together
they
plunged
over
a
fall
of
greenhued
stone
and
foamed
down
into
a
dell
about
it
stood
firtrees
short
and
bent
and
its
sides
were
steep
and
clothed
with
hartstongue
and
shrubs
of
whortleberry
at
the
bottom
there
was
a
level
space
through
which
the
stream
flowed
noisily
over
shining
pebbles
here
they
rested
it
was
now
nearly
three
hours
after
noon
and
they
had
come
only
a
few
miles
from
the
gates
already
the
sun
was
westering

while
gimli
and
the
two
younger
hobbits
kindled
a
fire
of
brush
and
firwood
and
drew
water
aragorn
tended
sam
and
frodo
sam's
wound
was
not
deep
but
it
looked
ugly
and
aragorn's
face
was
grave
as
he
examined
it
after
a
moment
he
looked
up
with
relief

'good
luck
sam
'
he
said
'many
have
received
worse
than
this
in
payment
for
the
slaying
of
their
first
orc
the
cut
is
not
poisoned
as
the
wounds
of
orcblades
too
often
are
it
should
heal
well
when
I
have
tended
it
bathe
it
when
gimli
has
heated
water'

he
opened
his
pouch
and
drew
out
some
withered
leaves
they
are
dry
and
some
of
their
virtue
has
one
he
said
but
here
I
have
still
some
of
the
leaves
of

athelas

that
I
gathered
near
weathertop
crush
one
in
the
water
and
wash
the
wound
clean
and
I
will
bind
it
now
it
is
your
turn
frodo
'

'i
am
all
right'
said
frodo
reluctant
to
have
his
garments
touched
aii
I
needed
was
some
food
and
a
little
rest'

no
'
said
aragorn
we
must
have
a
look
and
see
what
the
hammer
and
the
anvil
have
done
to
you
I
still
marvel
that
you
are
alive
at
all'
gently
he
stripped
off
frodo's
old
jacket
and
worn
tunic
and
gave
a
gasp
of
wonder
then
he
laughed
the
silver
corslet
shimmered
before
his
eyes
like
the
light
upon
a
rippling
sea
carefully
he
took
it
off
and
held
it
up
and
the
gems
on
it
glittered
like
stars
and
the
sound
of
the
shaken
rings
was
like
the
tinkle
of
rain
in
a
pool

look
my
friends'
he
called
here's
a
pretty
hobbitskin
to
wrap
an
elvenprinceling
in
if
it
were
known
that
hobbits
had
such
hides
all
the
hunters
of
middleearth
would
be
riding
to
the
shire'

and
all
the
arrows
of
all
the
hunters
in
the
world
would
be
in
vain'
said
gimli
gazing
at
the
mail
in
wonder
it
is
a
mithrilcoat
mithril
I
have
never
seen
or
heard
tell
of
one
so
fair
is
this
the
coat
that
gandalf
spoke
of
then
he
undervalued
it
but
it
was
well
given
'

I
have
often
wondered
what
you
and
bilbo
were
doing
so
close
in
his
little
room'
said
merry
'bless
the
old
hobbit
I
love
him
more
than
ever
I
hope
we
get
a
chance
of
telling
him
about
it
'

there
was
a
dark
and
blackened
bruise
on
frodo's
right
side
and
breast
under
the
mail
there
was
a
shirt
of
soft
leather
but
at
one
point
the
rings
had
been
driven
through
it
into
the
flesh
frodo's
left
side
also
was
scored
and
bruised
where
he
had
been
hurled
against
the
wall
while
the
others
set
the
food
ready
aragorn
bathed
the
hurts
with
water
in
which
athelas
was
steeped
the
pungent
fragrance
filled
the
dell
and
all
those
who
stooped
over
the
steaming
water
felt
refreshed
and
strengthened
soon
frodo
felt
the
pain
leave
him
and
his
breath
grew
easy
though
he
was
stiff
and
sore
to
the
touch
for
many
days
aragorn
bound
some
soft
pads
of
cloth
at
his
side

the
mail
is
marvellously
light'
he
said
put
it
on
again
if
you
can
bear
it
my
heart
is
glad
to
know
that
you
have
such
a
coat
do
not
lay
it
aside
even
in
sleep
unless
fortune
brings
you
where
you
are
safe
for
a
while
and
that
will
seldom
chance
while
your
quest
lasts'

when
they
had
eaten
the
company
got
ready
to
go
on
they
put
out
the
fire
and
hid
all
traces
of
it
then
climbing
out
of
the
dell
they
took
to
the
road
again
they
had
not
gone
far
before
the
sun
sank
behind
the
westward
heights
and
great
shadows
crept
down
the
mountainsides
dusk
veiled
their
feet
and
mist
rose
in
the
hollows
away
in
the
east
the
evening
light
lay
pale
upon
the
dim
lands
of
distant
plain
and
wood
sam
and
frodo
now
feeling
eased
and
greatly
refreshed
were
able
to
go
at
a
fair
pace
and
with
only
one
brief
halt
aragorn
led
the
company
on
for
nearly
three
more
hours

it
was
dark
deep
night
had
fallen
there
were
many
clear
stars
hut
the
fastwaning
moon
would
not
be
seen
till
late
gimli
and
frodo
were
at
the
rear
walking
softly
and
not
speaking
listening
for
any
sound
upon
the
road
behind
at
length
gimli
broke
the
silence

'not
a
sound
but
the
wind'
he
said
there
are
no
goblins
near
or
my
ears
are
made
of
wood
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
orcs
will
be
content
with
driving
us
from
moria
and
maybe
that
was
all
their
purpose
and
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
with
uswith
the
ring
though
orcs
will
often
pursue
foes
for
many
leagues
into
the
plain
if
they
have
a
fallen
captain
to
avenge'

frodo
did
not
answer
he
looked
at
sting
and
the
blade
was
dull
yet
he
had
heard
something
or
thought
he
had
as
soon
as
the
shadows
had
fallen
about
them
and
the
road
behind
was
dim
he
had
heard
again
the
quick
patter
of
feet
even
now
he
heard
it
he
turned
swiftly
there
were
two
tiny
gleams
of
light
behind
or
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
saw
them
but
at
once
they
slipped
aside
and
vanished

what
is
it
'
said
the
dwarf

I
don't
know'
answered
frodo
'i
thought
I
heard
feet
and
I
thought
I
saw
a
lightlike
eyes
I
have
thought
so
often
since
we
first
entered
moria'

gimli
halted
and
stooped
to
the
ground
'i
hear
nothing
but
the
nightspeech
of
plant
and
stone'
he
said
'come
let
us
hurry
the
others
are
out
of
sight'

the
nightwind
blew
chill
up
the
valley
to
meet
them
before
them
a
wide
grey
shadow
loomed
and
they
heard
an
endless
rustle
of
leaves
like
poplars
in
the
breeze

lothlrien
'
cried
legolas
'lothlrien
we
have
come
to
the
eaves
of
the
golden
wood
alas
that
it
is
winter
'

under
the
night
the
trees
stood
tall
before
them
arched
over
the
road
and
stream
that
ran
suddenly
beneath
their
spreading
boughs
in
the
dim
light
of
the
stars
their
stems
were
grey
and
their
quivering
leaves
a
hint
of
fallow
gold

'lothlrien
'
said
aragorn
'glad
I
am
to
hear
again
the
wind
in
the
trees
we
are
still
little
more
than
five
leagues
from
the
gates
but
we
can
go
no
further
here
let
us
hope
that
the
virtue
of
the
elves
will
keep
us
tonight
from
the
peril
that
comes
behind'

if
elves
indeed
still
dwell
here
in
the
darkening
world'
said
gimli

'it
is
long
since
any
of
my
own
folk
journeyed
hither
back
to
the
land
whence
we
wandered
in
ages
long
ago'
said
legolas
'but
we
hear
that
lrien
is
not
yet
deserted
for
there
is
a
secret
power
here
that
holds
evil
from
the
land
nevertheless
its
folk
are
seldom
seen
and
maybe
they
dwell
now
deep
in
the
woods
and
far
from
the
northern
border'

'indeed
deep
in
the
wood
they
dwell'
said
aragorn
and
sighed
as
if
some
memory
stirred
in
him
we
must
fend
for
ourselves
tonight
we
will
go
forward
a
short
way
until
the
trees
are
all
about
us
and
then
we
will
turn
aside
from
the
path
and
seek
a
place
to
rest
in'

he
stepped
forward
but
boromir
stood
irresolute
and
did
not
follow
'is
there
no
other
way
'
he
said

what
other
fairer
way
would
you
desire
'
said
aragorn

a
plain
road
though
it
led
through
a
hedge
of
swords'
said
boromir
by
strange
paths
has
this
company
been
led
and
so
far
to
evil
fortune
against
my
will
we
passed
under
the
shades
of
moria
to
our
loss
and
now
we
must
enter
the
golden
wood
you
say
but
of
that
perilous
land
we
have
heard
in
gondor
and
it
is
said
that
few
come
out
who
once
go
in
and
of
that
few
none
have
escaped
unscathed'

say
not

unscathed

but
if
you
say

unchanged

then
maybe
you
will
speak
the
truth
said
aragorn
but
lore
wanes
in
gondor
boromir
if
in
the
city
of
those
who
once
were
wise
they
now
speak
evil
of
lothlrien
believe
what
you
will
there
is
no
other
way
for
us

unless
you
would
go
back
to
moriagate
or
scale
the
pathless
mountains
or
swim
the
great
river
all
alone'

then
lead
on
'
said
boromir
but
it
is
perilous'

perilous
indeed'
said
aragorn
'fair
and
perilous
but
only
evil
need
fear
it
or
those
who
bring
some
evil
with
them
follow
me
'

they
had
gone
little
more
than
a
mile
into
the
forest
when
they
came
upon
another
stream
flowing
down
swiftly
from
the
treeclad
slopes
that
climbed
back
westward
towards
the
mountains
they
heard
it
splashing
over
a
fall
away
among
the
shadows
on
their
right
its
dark
hurrying
waters
ran
across
the
path
before
them
and
joined
the
silverlode
in
a
swirl
of
dim
pools
among
the
roots
of
trees


here
is
nimrodel
'
said
legolas
'of
this
stream
the
silvan
elves
made
many
songs
long
ago
and
still
we
sing
them
in
the
north
remembering
the
rainbow
on
its
falls
and
the
golden
flowers
that
floated
in
its
foam
all
is
dark
now
and
the
bridge
of
nimrodel
is
broken
down
I
will
bathe
my
feet
for
it
is
said
that
the
water
is
healing
to
the
weary'
he
went
forward
and
climbed
down
the
deepcloven
bank
and
stepped
into
the
stream

follow
me'
he
cried
'the
water
is
not
deep
let
us
wade
across
on
the
further
bank
we
can
rest
and
the
sound
of
the
falling
water
may
bring
us
sleep
and
forgetfulness
of
grief'

one
by
one
they
climbed
down
and
followed
legolas
for
a
moment
frodo
stood
near
the
brink
and
let
the
water
flow
over
his
tired
feet
it
was
cold
but
its
touch
was
clean
and
as
he
went
on
and
it
mounted
to
his
knees
he
felt
that
the
stain
of
travel
and
all
weariness
was
washed
from
his
limbs

when
all
the
company
had
crossed
they
sat
and
rested
and
ate
a
little
food
and
legolas
told
them
tales
of
lothlrien
that
the
elves
of
mirkwood
still
kept
in
their
hearts
of
sunlight
and
starlight
upon
the
meadows
by
the
great
river
before
the
world
was
grey

at
length
a
silence
fell
and
they
heard
the
music
of
the
waterfall
running
sweetly
in
the
shadows
almost
frodo
fancied
that
he
could
hear
a
voice
singing
mingled
with
the
sound
of
the
water

do
you
hear
the
voice
of
nimrodel
'
asked
legolas
'i
will
sing
you
a
song
of
the
maiden
nimrodel
who
bore
the
same
name
as
the
stream
beside
which
she
lived
lung
ago
it
is
a
fair
song
in
our
woodland
tongue
but
this
is
how
it
runs
in
the
westron
speech
as
some
in
rivendell
now
sing
it'
in
a
soft
voice
hardly
to
be
heard
amid
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
above
them
he
began

an
elvenmaid
there
was
of
old

a
shining
star
by
day

her
mantle
white
was
hemmed
with
gold

her
shoes
of
silvergrey


a
star
was
bound
upon
her
brows

a
light
was
on
her
hair

as
sun
upon
the
golden
boughs

in
lrien
the
fair


her
hair
was
long
her
limbs
were
white

and
fair
she
was
and
free

and
in
the
wind
she
went
as
light

as
leaf
of
lindentree


beside
the
falls
of
nimrodel

by
water
clear
and
cool

her
voice
as
falling
silver
fell

into
the
shining
pool


where
now
she
wanders
none
can
tell

in
sunlight
or
in
shade

for
lost
of
yore
was
nimrodel

and
in
the
mountains
strayed


the
elvenship
in
haven
grey

beneath
the
mountainlee

awaited
her
for
many
a
day

beside
the
roaring
sea



a
wind
by
night
in
northern
lands

arose
and
loud
it
cried

and
drove
the
ship
from
elvenstrands

across
the
streaming
tide


when
dawn
came
dim
the
land
was
lost

the
mountains
sinking
grey

beyond
the
heaving
waves
that
tossed

their
plumes
of
blinding
spray


amroth
beheld
the
fading
shore

now
low
beyond
the
swell

and
cursed
the
faithless
ship
that
bore

him
far
from
nimrodel


of
old
he
was
an
elvenking

a
lord
of
tree
and
glen

when
golden
were
the
boughs
in
spring

in
fair
lothlrien


from
helm
to
sea
they
saw
him
leap

as
arrow
from
the
string

and
dive
into
the
water
deep

as
mew
upon
the
wing


the
wind
was
in
his
flowing
hair

the
foam
about
him
shone

afar
they
saw
him
strong
and
fair

go
riding
like
a
swan


but
from
the
west
has
come
no
word

and
on
the
hither
shore

no
tidings
elvenfolk
have
heard

of
amroth
evermore


the
voice
of
legolas
faltered
and
the
song
ceased
'i
cannot
sing
any
more'
he
said
'that
is
but
a
part
for
I
have
forgotten
much
it
is
long
and
sad
for
it
tells
how
sorrow
came
upon
lothlrien
lrien
of
the
blossom
when
the
dwarves
awakened
evil
in
the
mountains'

but
the
dwarves
did
not
make
the
evil'
said
gimli

I
said
not
so
yet
evil
came'
answered
legolas
sadly
then
many
of
the
elves
of
nimrodel's
kindred
left
their
dwellings
and
departed
and
she
was
lost
far
in
the
south
in
the
passes
of
the
white
mountains
and
she
came
not
to
the
ship
where
amroth
her
lover
waited
for
her
but
in
the
spring
when
the
wind
is
in
the
new
leaves
the
echo
of
her
voice
may
still
be
heard
by
the
falls
that
bear
her
name
and
when
the
wind
is
in
the
south
the
voice
of
amroth
comes
up
from
the
sea
for
nimrodel
flows
into
silverlode
that
elves
call
celebrant
and
celebrant
into
anduin
the
great
and
anduin
flows
into
the
bay
of
belfalas
whence
the
elves
of
lrien
set
sail
but
neither
nimrodel
nor
amroth
ever
came
back

'it
is
told
that
she
had
a
house
built
in
the
branches
of
a
tree
that
grew
near
the
falls
for
that
was
the
custom
of
the
elves
of
lrien
to
dwell
in
the
trees
and
maybe
it
is
so
still
therefore
they
were
called
the
galadhrim
the
treepeople
deep
in
their
forest
the
trees
are
very
great
the
people
of
the
woods
did
not
delve
in
the
ground
like
dwarves
nor
build
strong
places
of
stone
before
the
shadow
came'

and
even
in
these
latter
days
dwelling
in
the
trees
might
be
thought
safer
than
sitting
on
the
ground'
said
gimli
he
looked
across
the
stream
to
the
road
that
led
back
to
dimrill
dale
and
then
up
into
the
roof
of
dark
boughs
above

your
words
bring
good
counsel
gimli'
said
aragorn
we
cannot
build
a
house
but
tonight
we
will
do
as
the
galadhrim
and
seek
refuge
in
the
treetops
if
we
can
we
have
sat
here
beside
the
road
already
longer
than
was
wise'

the
company
now
turned
aside
from
the
path
and
went
into
the
shadow
of
the
deeper
woods
westward
along
the
mountainstream
away
from
silverlode
not
far
from
the
falls
of
nimrodel
they
found
a
cluster
of
trees
some
of
which
overhung
the
stream
their
great
grey
trunks
were
of
mighty
girth
but
their
height
could
not
be
guessed

I
will
climb
up'
said
legolas
I
am
at
home
among
trees
by
root
or
bough
though
these
trees
are
of
a
kind
strange
to
me
save
as
a
name
in
song

mellyrn

they
are
called
and
are
those
that
bear
the
yellow
blossom
but
I
have
never
climbed
in
one
I
will
see
now
what
is
their
shape
and
way
of
growth'

whatever
it
may
be'
said
pippin
they
will
be
marvellous
trees
indeed
if
they
can
offer
any
rest
at
night
except
to
birds
I
cannot
sleep
on
a
perch
'

'then
dig
a
hole
in
the
ground'
said
legolas
if
that
is
more
after
the
fashion
of
your
kind
but
you
must
dig
swift
and
deep
if
you
wish
to
hide
from
orcs'
he
sprang
lightly
up
from
the
ground
and
caught
a
branch
that
grew
from
the
trunk
high
above
his
head
but
even
as
he
swung
there
for
a
moment
a
voice
spoke
suddenly
from
the
treeshadows
above
him


daro
'
it
said
in
commanding
tone
and
legolas
dropped
back
to
earth
in
surprise
and
fear
he
shrank
against
the
bole
of
the
tree

'stand
still
'
he
whispered
to
the
others
do
not
move
or
speak
'

there
was
a
sound
of
soft
laughter
over
their
heads
and
then
another
clear
voice
spoke
in
an
elventongue
frodo
could
understand
little
of
what
was
said
for
the
speech
that
the
silvan
folk
east
of
the
mountains
used
among
themselves
was
unlike
that
of
the
west
legolas
looked
up
and
answered
in
the
same
language

who
are
they
and
what
do
they
say
'
asked
merry

they're
elves'
said
sam
can't
you
hear
their
voices
'

yes
they
are
elves'
said
legolas
and
they
say
that
you
breathe
so
loud
that
they
could
shoot
you
in
the
dark'
sam
hastily
put
his
hand
over
his
mouth
'but
they
say
also
that
you
need
have
no
fear
they
have
been
aware
of
us
for
a
long
while
they
heard
my
voice
across
the
nimrodel
and
knew
that
I
was
one
of
their
northern
kindred
and
therefore
they
did
not
hinder
our
crossing
and
afterwards
they
heard
my
song
now
they
bid
me
climb
up
with
frodo
for
they
seem
to
have
had
some
tidings
of
him
and
of
our
journey
the
others
they
ask
to
wait
a
little
and
to
keep
watch
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
until
they
have
decided
what
is
to
be
done'

out
of
the
shadows
a
ladder
was
let
down
it
was
made
of
rope
silvergrey
and
glimmering
in
the
dark
and
though
it
looked
slender
it
proved
strong
enough
to
bear
many
men
legolas
ran
lightly
up
and
frodo
followed
slowly
behind
came
sam
trying
not
to
breathe
loudly
the
branches
of
the
mallorntree
grew
out
nearly
straight
from
the
trunk
and
then
swept
upward
but
near
the
top
the
main
stem
divided
into
a
crown
of
many
boughs
and
among
these
they
found
that
there
had
been
built
a
wooden
platform
or

flet

as
such
things
were
called
in
those
days
the
elves
called
it
a

talan

it
was
reached
by
a
round
hole
in
the
centre
through
which
the
ladder
passed

when
frodo
came
at
last
up
on
to
the
flet
he
found
legolas
seated
with
three
other
elves
they
were
clad
in
shadowygrey
and
could
not
be
seen
among
the
treestems
unless
they
moved
suddenly
they
stood
up
and
one
of
them
uncovered
a
small
lamp
that
gave
out
a
slender
silver
beam
he
held
it
up
looking
at
frodo's
face
and
sam's
then
he
shut
off
the
light
again
and
spoke
words
of
welcome
in
his
elventongue
frodo
spoke
haltingly
in
return

welcome'
the
elf
then
said
again
in
the
common
language
speaking
slowly
'we
seldom
use
any
tongue
but
our
own
for
we
dwell
now
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
and
do
not
willingly
have
dealings
with
any
other
folk
even
our
own
kindred
in
the
north
are
sundered
from
us
but
there
are
some
of
us
still
who
go
abroad
for
the
gathering
of
news
and
the
watching
of
our
enemies
and
they
speak
the
languages
of
other
lands
I
am
one
haldir
is
my
name
my
brothers
rmil
and
orophin
speak
little
of
your
tongue

but
we
have
heard
rumours
of
your
coming
for
the
messengers
of
elrond
passed
by
lrien
on
their
way
home
up
the
dimrill
stair
we
had
not
heard
of
hobbits
or
halflings
for
many
a
long
year
and
did
not
know
that
any
yet
dwelt
in
middleearth
you
do
not
look
evil
and
since
you
come
with
an
elf
of
our
kindred
we
are
willing
to
befriend
you
as
elrond
asked
though
it
is
not
our
custom
to
lead
strangers
through
our
land
but
you
must
stay
here
tonight
how
many
are
you
'

eight'
said
legolas
myself
four
hobbits
and
two
men
one
of
whom
aragorn
is
an
elffriend
of
the
folk
of
westernesse'

the
name
of
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
is
known
in
lrien'
said
haldir
and
he
has
the
favour
of
the
lady
all
then
is
well
but
you
have
yet
spoken
only
of
seven'

the
eighth
is
a
dwarf'
said
legolas

a
dwarf
'
said
haldir
that
is
not
well
we
have
not
had
dealings
with
the
dwarves
since
the
dark
days
they
are
not
permitted
in
our
land
I
cannot
allow
him
to
pass'

but
he
is
from
the
lonely
mountain
one
of
din's
trusty
people
and
friendly
to
elrond'
said
frodo
elrond
himself
chose
him
to
be
one
of
our
companions
and
he
has
been
brave
and
faithful'

the
elves
spoke
together
in
soft
voices
and
questioned
legolas
in
their
own
tongue
'very
good'
said
haldir
at
last
we
will
do
this
though
it
is
against
our
liking
if
aragorn
and
legolas
will
guard
him
and
answer
for
him
he
shall
pass
but
he
must
go
blindfold
through
lothlrien

but
now
we
must
debate
no
longer
your
folk
must
not
remain
on
the
ground
we
have
been
keeping
watch
on
the
rivers
ever
since
we
saw
a
great
troop
of
orcs
going
north
toward
moria
along
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
many
days
ago
wolves
are
howling
on
the
wood's
borders
if
you
have
indeed
come
from
moria
the
peril
cannot
be
far
behind
tomorrow
early
you
must
go
on

'the
four
hobbits
shall
climb
up
here
and
stay
with
uswe
do
not
fear
them
there
is
another

talan

in
the
next
tree
there
the
others
must
take
refuge
you
legolas
must
answer
to
us
for
them
call
us
if
anything
is
amiss
and
have
an
eye
on
that
dwarf'

legolas
at
once
went
down
the
ladder
to
take
haldir's
message
and
soon
afterwards
merry
and
pippin
clambered
up
on
to
the
high
flet
they
were
out
of
breath
and
seemed
rather
scared

there'
said
merry
panting
we
have
lugged
up
your
blankets
as
well
as
our
own
strider
has
hidden
all
the
rest
of
the
baggage
in
a
deep
drift
of
leaves'

you
had
no
need
of
your
burdens'
said
haldir
it
is
cold
in
the
treetops
in
winter
though
the
wind
tonight
is
in
the
south
but
we
have
food
and
drink
to
give
you
that
will
drive
away
the
nightchill
and
we
have
skins
and
cloaks
to
spare'

the
hobbits
accepted
this
second
and
far
better
supper
very
gladly
then
they
wrapped
themselves
warmly
not
only
in
the
furcloaks
of
the
elves
but
in
their
own
blankets
as
well
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
but
weary
as
they
were
only
sam
found
that
easy
to
do
hobbits
do
not
like
heights
and
do
not
sleep
upstairs
even
when
they
have
any
stairs
the
flet
was
not
at
all
to
their
liking
as
a
bedroom
it
had
no
walls
not
even
a
rail
only
on
one
side
was
there
a
light
plaited
screen
which
could
be
moved
and
fixed
in
different
places
according
to
the
wind

pippin
went
on
talking
for
a
while
I
hope
if
I
do
go
to
sleep
in
this
bedloft
that
I
shan't
roll
off'
he
said

once
I
do
get
to
sleep'
said
sam
'i
shall
go
on
sleeping
whether
I
roll
off
or
no
and
the
less
said
the
sooner
i'll
drop
off
if
you
take
my
meaning'


frodo
lay
for
some
time
awake
and
looked
up
at
the
stars
glinting
through
the
pale
roof
of
quivering
leaves
sam
was
snoring
at
his
side
long
before
he
himself
closed
his
eyes
he
could
dimly
see
the
grey
forms
of
two
elves
sitting
motionless
with
their
arms
about
their
knees
speaking
in
whispers
the
other
had
gone
down
to
take
up
his
watch
on
one
of
the
lower
branches
at
last
lulled
by
the
wind
in
the
boughs
above
and
the
sweet
murmur
of
the
falls
of
nimrodel
below
frodo
fell
asleep
with
the
song
of
legolas
running
in
his
mind

late
in
the
night
he
awoke
the
other
hobbits
were
asleep
the
elves
were
gone
the
sickle
moon
was
gleaming
dimly
among
the
leaves
the
wind
was
still
a
little
way
off
he
heard
a
harsh
laugh
and
the
tread
of
many
feet
on
the
ground
below
there
was
a
ring
of
metal
the
sounds
died
slowly
away
and
seemed
to
go
southward
on
into
the
wood

a
head
appeared
suddenly
through
the
hole
in
the
flet
frodo
sat
up
in
alarm
and
saw
that
it
was
a
greyhooded
elf
he
looked
towards
the
hobbits

what
is
it
'
said
frodo


yrch
'
said
the
elf
in
a
hissing
whisper
and
cast
on
to
the
flet
the
ropeladder
rolled
up

'orcs
'
said
frodo
what
are
they
doing
'
but
the
elf
had
gone

there
were
no
more
sounds
even
the
leaves
were
silent
and
the
very
falls
seemed
to
be
hushed
frodo
sat
and
shivered
in
his
wraps
he
was
thankful
that
they
had
not
been
caught
on
the
ground
but
he
felt
that
the
trees
offered
little
protection
except
concealment
orcs
were
as
keen
as
hounds
on
a
scent
it
was
said
but
they
could
also
climb
he
drew
out
sting
it
flashed
and
glittered
like
a
blue
flame
and
then
slowly
faded
again
and
grew
dull
in
spite
of
the
fading
of
his
sword
the
feeling
of
immediate
danger
did
not
leave
frodo
rather
it
grew
stronger
he
got
up
and
crawled
to
the
opening
and
peered
down
he
was
almost
certain
that
he
could
hear
stealthy
movements
at
the
tree's
foot
far
below

not
elves
for
the
woodland
folk
were
altogether
noiseless
in
their
movements
then
he
heard
faintly
a
sound
like
sniffing
and
something
seemed
to
be
scrabbling
on
the
bark
of
the
treetrunk
he
stared
down
into
the
dark
holding
his
breath

something
was
now
climbing
slowly
and
its
breath
came
like
a
soft
hissing
through
closed
teeth
then
coming
up
close
to
the
stem
frodo
saw
two
pale
eyes
they
stopped
and
gazed
upward
unwinking
suddenly
they
turned
away
and
a
shadowy
figure
slipped
round
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
vanished

immediately
afterwards
haldir
came
climbing
swiftly
up
through
the
branches
there
was
something
in
this
tree
that
I
have
never
seen
before'
he
said
it
was
not
an
orc
it
fled
as
soon
as
I
touched
the
treestem
it
seemed
to
be
wary
and
to
have
some
skill
in
trees
or
I
might
have
thought
that
it
was
one
of
you
hobbits

'i
did
not
shoot
for
I
dared
not
arouse
any
cries
we
cannot
risk
battle
a
strong
company
of
orcs
has
passed
they
crossed
the
nimrodelcurse
their
foul
feet
in
its
clean
waterand
went
on
down
the
old
road
beside
the
river
they
seemed
to
pick
up
some
scent
and
they
searched
the
ground
for
a
while
near
the
place
where
you
halted
the
three
of
us
could
not
challenge
a
hundred
so
we
went
ahead
and
spoke
with
feigned
voices
leading
them
on
into
the
wood

orophin
has
now
gone
in
haste
back
to
our
dwellings
to
warn
our
people
none
of
the
orcs
will
ever
return
out
of
lrien
and
there
will
be
many
elves
hidden
on
the
northern
border
before
another
night
falls
but
you
must
take
the
road
south
as
soon
as
it
is
fully
light'

day
came
pale
from
the
east
as
the
light
grew
it
filtered
through
the
yellow
leaves
of
the
mallorn
and
it
seemed
to
the
hobbits
that
the
early
sun
of
a
cool
summer's
morning
was
shining
paleblue
sky
peeped
among
the
moving
branches
looking
through
an
opening
on
the
south
side
of
the
flet
frodo
saw
all
the
valley
of
the
silverlode
lying
like
a
sea
of
fallow
gold
tossing
gently
in
the
breeze

the
morning
was
still
young
and
cold
when
the
company
set
out
again
guided
now
by
haldir
and
his
brother
rmil
farewell
sweet
nimrodel
'
cried
legolas
frodo
looked
back
and
caught
a
gleam
of
white
foam
among
the
grey
treestems
farewell'
he
said
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
never
hear
again
a
running
water
so
beautiful
for
ever
blending
its
innumerable
notes
in
an
endless
changeful
music

they
went
back
to
the
path
that
still
went
on
along
the
west
side
of
the
silverlode
and
for
some
way
they
followed
it
southward
there
were
the
prints
of
orcfeet
in
the
earth
but
soon
haldir
turned
aside
into
the
trees
and
halted
on
the
bank
of
the
river
under
their
shadows

there
is
one
of
my
people
yonder
across
the
stream'
he
said
though
you
may
not
see
him'
he
gave
a
call
like
the
low
whistle
of
a
bird
and
out
of
a
thicket
of
young
trees
an
elf
stepped
clad
in
grey
but
with
his
hood
thrown
back
his
hair
glinted
like
gold
in
the
morning
sun
haldir
skilfully
cast
over
the
stream
a
coil
of
grey
rope
and
he
caught
it
and
bound
the
end
about
a
tree
near
the
bank

celebrant
is
already
a
strong
stream
here
as
you
see'
said
haldir
'and
it
runs
both
swift
and
deep
and
is
very
cold
we
do
not
set
foot
in
it
so
far
north
unless
we
must
but
in
these
days
of
watchfulness
we
do
not
make
bridges
this
is
how
we
cross
follow
me'
he
made
his
end
of
the
rope
fast
about
another
tree
and
then
ran
lightly
along
it
over
the
river
and
back
again
as
if
he
were
on
a
road

I
can
walk
this
path'
said
legolas
but
the
others
have
not
this
skill
must
they
swim'

no'
said
haldir
we
have
two
more
ropes
we
will
fasten
them
above
the
other
one
shoulderhigh
and
another
halfhigh
and
holding
these
the
strangers
should
be
able
to
cross
with
care'

when
this
slender
bridge
had
been
made
the
company
passed
over
some
cautiously
and
slowly
others
more
easily
of
the
hobbits
pippin
proved
the
best
for
he
was
surefooted
and
he
walked
over
quickly
holding
only
with
one
hand
but
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
bank
ahead
and
did
not
look
down
sam
shuffled
along
clutching
hard
and
looking
down
into
the
pale
eddying
water
as
if
it
was
a
chasm
in
the
mountains

he
breathed
with
relief
when
he
was
safely
across
live
and
learn
as
my
gaffer
used
to
say
though
he
was
thinking
of
gardening
not
of
roosting
like
a
bird
nor
of
trying
to
walk
like
a
spider
not
even
my
uncle
andy
ever
did
a
trick
like
that
'

when
at
length
all
the
company
was
gathered
on
the
east
bank
of
the
silverlode
the
elves
untied
the
ropes
and
coiled
two
of
them
rmil
who
had
remained
on
the
other
side
drew
back
the
last
one
slung
it
on
his
shoulder
and
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
went
away
back
to
nimrodel
to
keep
watch

now
friends'
said
haldir
you
have
entered
the
naith
of
lrien
or
the
gore
as
you
would
say
for
it
is
the
land
that
lies
like
a
spearhead
between
the
arms
of
silverlode
and
anduin
the
great
we
allow
no
strangers
to
spy
out
the
secrets
of
the
naith
few
indeed
are
permitted
even
to
set
foot
there

as
was
agreed
I
shall
here
blindfold
the
eyes
of
gimli
the
dwarf
the
other
may
walk
free
for
a
while
until
we
come
nearer
to
our
dwellings
down
in
egladil
in
the
angle
between
the
waters'

this
was
not
at
all
to
the
liking
of
gimli
the
agreement
was
made
without
my
consent'
he
said
I
will
not
walk
blindfold
like
a
beggar
or
a
prisoner
and
I
am
no
spy
my
folk
have
never
had
dealings
with
any
of
the
servants
of
the
enemy
neither
have
we
done
harm
to
the
elves
I
am
no
more
likely
to
betray
you
than
legolas
or
any
other
of
my
companions'

'i
do
not
doubt
you'
said
haldir
'yet
this
is
our
law
I
am
not
the
master
of
the
law
and
cannot
set
it
aside
I
have
done
much
in
letting
you
set
foot
over
celebrant'

gimli
was
obstinate
he
planted
his
feet
firmly
apart
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
haft
of
his
axe
'i
will
go
forward
free'
he
said
'or
I
will
go
back
and
seek
my
own
land
where
I
am
known
to
be
true
of
word
though
I
perish
alone
in
the
wilderness'

you
cannot
go
back'
said
haldir
sternly
'now
you
have
come
thus
far
you
must
be
brought
before
the
lord
and
the
lady
they
shall
judge
you
to
hold
you
or
to
give
you
leave
as
they
will
you
cannot
cross
the
rivers
again
and
behind
you
there
are
now
secret
sentinels
that
you
cannot
pass
you
would
be
slain
before
you
saw
them'


gimli
drew
his
axe
from
his
belt
haldir
and
his
companion
bent
their
bows
'a
plague
on
dwarves
and
their
stiff
necks
'
said
legolas

'come'
said
aragorn
if
I
am
still
to
lead
this
company
you
must
do
as
I
bid
it
is
hard
upon
the
dwarf
to
be
thus
singled
out
we
will
all
be
blindfold
even
legolas
that
will
be
best
though
it
will
make
the
journey
slow
and
dull'

gimli
laughed
suddenly
a
merry
troop
of
fools
we
shall
look
will
haldir
lead
us
all
on
a
string
like
many
blind
beggars
with
one
dog
but
I
will
be
content
if
only
legolas
here
shares
my
blindness'

I
am
an
elf
and
a
kinsman
here'
said
legolas
becoming
angry
in
his
turn

now
let
us
cry
a
plague
on
the
stiff
necks
of
elves'
said
aragorn
but
the
company
shall
all
fare
alike
come
bind
our
eyes
haldir
'

I
shall
claim
full
amends
for
every
fall
and
stubbed
toe
if
you
do
not
lead
us
well'
said
gimli
as
they
bound
a
cloth
about
his
eyes

'you
will
have
no
claim'
said
haldir
I
shall
lead
you
well
and
the
paths
are
smooth
and
straight'

alas
for
the
folly
of
these
days
'
said
legolas
'here
all
are
enemies
of
the
one
enemy
and
yet
I
must
walk
blind
while
the
sun
is
merry
in
the
woodland
under
leaves
of
gold
'

folly
it
may
seem'
said
haldir
'indeed
in
nothing
is
the
power
of
the
dark
lord
more
clearly
shown
than
in
the
estrangement
that
divides
all
those
who
still
oppose
him
yet
so
little
faith
and
trust
do
we
find
now
in
the
world
beyond
lothlrien
unless
maybe
in
rivendell
that
we
dare
not
by
our
own
trust
endanger
our
land
we
live
now
upon
an
island
amid
many
perils
and
our
hands
are
more
often
upon
the
bowstring
than
upon
the
harp

the
rivers
long
defended
us
but
they
are
a
sure
guard
no
more
for
the
shadow
has
crept
northward
all
about
us
some
speak
of
departing
yet
for
that
it
already
seems
too
late
the
mountains
to
the
west
are
growing
evil
to
the
east
the
lands
are
waste
and
full
of
sauron's
creatures
and
it
is
rumoured
that
we
cannot
now
safely
pass
southward
through
rohan
and
the
mouths
of
the
great
river
are
watched
by
the
enemy
even
if
we
could
come
to
the
shores
of
the
sea
we
should
find
no
longer
any
shelter
there
it
is
said
that
there
are
still
havens
of
the
high
elves
but
they
are
far
north
and
west
beyond
the
land
of
the
halflings
but
where
that
may
be
though
the
lord
and
lady
may
know
I
do
not'

you
ought
at
least
to
guess
since
you
have
seen
us'
said
merry
there
are
elfhavens
west
of
my
land
the
shire
where
hobbits
live'

happy
folk
are
hobbits
to
dwell
near
the
shores
of
the
sea
'
said
haldir
'it
is
long
indeed
since
any
of
my
folk
have
looked
on
it
yet
still
we
remember
it
in
song
tell
me
of
these
havens
as
we
walk'

I
cannot'
said
merry
I
have
never
seen
them
I
have
never
been
out
of
my
own
land
before
and
if
I
had
known
what
the
world
outside
was
like
I
don't
think
I
should
have
had
the
heart
to
leave
it'

not
even
to
see
fair
lothlrien
'
said
haldir
'the
world
is
indeed
full
of
peril
and
in
it
there
are
many
dark
places
but
still
there
is
much
that
is
fair
and
though
in
all
lands
love
is
now
mingled
with
grief
it
grows
perhaps
the
greater

some
there
are
among
us
who
sing
that
the
shadow
will
draw
back
and
peace
shall
come
again
yet
I
do
not
believe
that
the
world
about
us
will
ever
again
be
as
it
was
of
old
or
the
light
of
the
sun
as
it
was
aforetime
for
the
elves
I
fear
it
will
prove
at
best
a
truce
in
which
they
may
pass
to
the
sea
unhindered
and
leave
the
middleearth
for
ever
alas
for
lothlrien
that
I
love
it
would
be
a
poor
life
in
a
land
where
no
mallorn
grew
but
if
there
are
mallorntrees
beyond
the
great
sea
none
have
reported
it'

as
they
spoke
thus
the
company
filed
slowly
along
the
paths
in
the
wood
led
by
haldir
while
the
other
elf
walked
behind
they
felt
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
smooth
and
soft
and
after
a
while
they
walked
more
freely
without
fear
of
hurt
or
fall
being
deprived
of
sight
frodo
found
his
hearing
and
other
senses
sharpened
he
could
smell
the
trees
and
the
trodden
grass
he
could
hear
many
different
notes
in
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
overhead
the
river
murmuring
away
on
his
right
and
the
thin
clear
voices
of
birds
in
the
sky
he
felt
the
sun
upon
his
face
and
hands
when
they
passed
through
an
open
glade

as
soon
as
he
set
foot
upon
the
far
bank
of
silverlode
a
strange
feeling
had
come
upon
him
and
it
deepened
as
he
walked
on
into
the
naith
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
stepped
over
a
bridge
of
time
into
a
corner
of
the
elder
days
and
was
now
walking
in
a
world
that
was
no
more
in
rivendell
there
was
memory
of
ancient
things
in
lrien
the
ancient
things
still
lived
on
in
the
waking
world
evil
had
been
seen
and
heard
there
sorrow
had
been
known
the
elves
feared
and
distrusted
the
world
outside
wolves
were
howling
on
the
wood's
borders
but
on
the
land
of
lrien
no
shadow
lay

all
that
day
the
company
marched
on
until
they
felt
the
cool
evening
come
and
heard
the
early
nightwind
whispering
among
many
leaves
then
they
rested
and
slept
without
fear
upon
the
ground
for
their
guides
would
not
permit
them
to
unbind
their
eyes
and
they
could
not
climb
in
the
morning
they
went
on
again
walking
without
haste
at
noon
they
halted
and
frodo
was
aware
that
they
had
passed
out
under
the
shining
sun
suddenly
he
heard
the
sound
of
many
voices
all
around
him

a
marching
host
of
elves
had
come
up
silently
they
were
hastening
toward
the
northern
borders
to
guard
against
any
attack
from
moria
and
they
brought
news
some
of
which
haldir
reported
the
marauding
orcs
had
been
waylaid
and
almost
all
destroyed
the
remnant
had
fled
westward
towards
the
mountains
and
were
being
pursued
a
strange
creature
also
had
been
seen
running
with
bent
back
and
with
hands
near
the
ground
like
a
beast
and
yet
not
of
beastshape
it
had
eluded
capture
and
they
had
not
shot
it
not
knowing
whether
it
was
good
or
ill
and
it
had
vanished
down
the
silverlode
southward

also'
said
haldir
they
bring
me
a
message
from
the
lord
and
lady
of
the
galadhrim
you
are
all
to
walk
free
even
the
dwarf
gimli
it
seems
that
the
lady
knows
who
and
what
is
each
member
of
your
company
new
messages
have
come
from
rivendell
perhaps'

he
removed
the
bandage
first
from
gimli's
eyes
'your
pardon
'
he
said
bowing
low
look
on
us
now
with
friendly
eyes
look
and
be
glad
for
you
are
the
first
dwarf
to
behold
the
trees
of
the
naith
of
lrien
since
durin's
day
'

when
his
eyes
were
in
turn
uncovered
frodo
looked
up
and
caught
his
breath
they
were
standing
in
an
open
space
to
the
left
stood
a
great
mound
covered
with
a
sward
of
grass
as
green
as
springtime
in
the
elder
days
upon
it
as
a
double
crown
grew
two
circles
of
trees
the
outer
had
bark
of
snowy
white
and
were
leafless
but
beautiful
in
their
shapely
nakedness
the
inner
were
mallorntrees
of
great
height
still
arrayed
in
pale
gold
high
amid
the
branches
of
a
towering
tree
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
all
there
gleamed
a
white
flet
at
the
feet
of
the
trees
and
all
about
the
green
hillsides
the
grass
was
studded
with
small
golden
flowers
shaped
like
stars
among
them
nodding
on
slender
stalks
were
other
flowers
white
and
palest
green
they
glimmered
as
a
mist
amid
the
rich
hue
of
the
grass
over
all
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
sun
of
afternoon
glowed
upon
the
hill
and
cast
long
green
shadows
beneath
the
trees

'behold
you
are
come
to
cerin
amroth'
said
haldir
for
this
is
the
heart
of
the
ancient
realm
as
it
was
long
ago
and
here
is
the
mound
of
amroth
where
in
happier
days
his
high
house
was
built
here
ever
bloom
the
winter
flowers
in
the
unfading
grass
the
yellow

elanor

and
the
pale

niphredil

here
we
will
stay
awhile
and
come
to
the
city
of
the
galadhrim
at
dusk'

the
others
cast
themselves
down
upon
the
fragrant
grass
but
frodo
stood
awhile
still
lost
in
wonder
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
stepped
through
a
high
window
that
looked
on
a
vanished
world
a
light
was
upon
it
for
which
his
language
had
no
name
all
that
he
saw
was
shapely
but
the
shapes
seemed
at
once
clear
cut
as
if
they
had
been
first
conceived
and
drawn
at
the
uncovering
of
his
eyes
and
ancient
as
if
they
had
endured
for
ever
he
saw
no
colour
but
those
he
knew
gold
and
white
and
blue
and
green
but
they
were
fresh
and
poignant
as
if
he
had
at
that
moment
first
perceived
them
and
made
for
them
names
new
and
wonderful
in
winter
here
no
heart
could
mourn
for
summer
or
for
spring
no
blemish
or
sickness
or
deformity
could
be
seen
in
anything
that
grew
upon
the
earth
on
the
land
of
lrien
there
was
no
stain

he
turned
and
saw
that
sam
was
now
standing
beside
him
looking
round
with
a
puzzled
expression
and
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
he
was
not
sure
that
he
was
awake
it's
sunlight
and
bright
day
right
enough'
he
said
I
thought
that
elves
were
all
for
moon
and
stars
but
this
is
more
elvish
than
anything
I
ever
heard
tell
of
I
feel
as
if
I
was

inside

a
song
if
you
take
my
meaning'

haldir
looked
at
them
and
he
seemed
indeed
to
take
the
meaning
of
both
thought
and
word
he
smiled
you
feel
the
power
of
the
lady
of
the
galadhrim'
he
said
would
it
please
you
to
climb
with
me
up
cerin
amroth
'

they
followed
him
as
he
stepped
lightly
up
the
grassclad
slopes
though
he
walked
and
breathed
and
about
him
living
leaves
and
flowers
were
stirred
by
the
same
cool
wind
as
fanned
his
face
frodo
felt
that
he
was
in
a
timeless
land
that
did
not
fade
or
change
or
fall
into
forgetfulness
when
he
had
gone
and
passed
again
into
the
outer
world
still
frodo
the
wanderer
from
the
shire
would
walk
there
upon
the
grass
among

elanor

and

niphredil

in
fair
lothlrien

they
entered
the
circle
of
white
trees
as
they
did
so
the
south
wind
blew
upon
cerin
amroth
and
sighed
among
the
branches
frodo
stood
still
hearing
far
off

great
seas
upon
beaches
that
had
long
ago
been
washed
away
and
seabirds
crying
whose
race
had
perished
from
the
earth

haldir
had
gone
on
and
was
now
climbing
to
the
high
flet
as
frodo
prepared
to
follow
him
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
tree
beside
the
ladder
never
before
had
he
been
so
suddenly
and
so
keenly
aware
of
the
feel
and
texture
of
a
tree's
skin
and
of
the
life
within
it
he
felt
a
delight
in
wood
and
the
touch
of
it
neither
as
forester
nor
as
carpenter
it
was
the
delight
of
the
living
tree
itself

as
he
stepped
out
at
last
upon
the
lofty
platform
haldir
took
his
hand
and
turned
him
toward
the
south
look
this
way
first
'
he
said

frodo
looked
and
saw
still
at
some
distance
a
hill
of
many
mighty
trees
or
a
city
of
green
towers
which
it
was
he
could
not
tell
out
of
it
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
power
and
light
came
that
held
all
the
land
in
sway
he
longed
suddenly
to
fly
like
a
bird
to
rest
in
the
green
city
then
he
looked
eastward
and
saw
all
the
land
of
lrien
running
down
to
the
pale
gleam
of
anduin
the
great
river
he
lifted
his
eyes
across
the
river
and
all
the
light
went
out
and
he
was
back
again
in
the
world
he
knew
beyond
the
river
the
land
appeared
flat
and
empty
formless
and
vague
until
far
away
it
rose
again
like
a
wall
dark
and
drear
the
sun
that
lay
on
lothlrien
had
no
power
to
enlighten
the
shadow
of
that
distant
height

there
lies
the
fastness
of
southern
mirkwood'
said
haldir
it
is
clad
in
a
forest
of
dark
fir
where
the
trees
strive
one
against
another
and
their
branches
rot
and
wither
in
the
midst
upon
a
stony
height
stands
dol
guldur
where
long
the
hidden
enemy
had
his
dwelling
we
fear
that
now
it
is
inhabited
again
and
with
power
sevenfold
a
black
cloud
lies
often
over
it
of
late
in
this
high
place
you
may
see
the
two
powers
that
are
opposed
one
to
another
and
ever
they
strive
now
in
thought
but
whereas
the
light
perceives
the
very
heart
of
the
darkness
its
own
secret
has
not
been
discovered
not
yet'
he
turned
and
climbed
swiftly
down
and
they
followed
him

at
the
hill's
foot
frodo
found
aragorn
standing
still
and
silent
as
a
tree
but
in
his
hand
was
a
small
golden
bloom
of
elanor
and
a
light
was
in
his
eyes
he
was
wrapped
in
some
fair
memory
and
as
frodo
looked
at
him
he
knew
that
he
beheld
things
as
they
once
had
been
in
this
same
place
for
the
grim
years
were
removed
from
the
face
of
aragorn
and
he
seemed
clothed
in
white
a
young
lord
tall
and
fair
and
he
spoke
words
in
the
elvish
tongue
to
one
whom
frodo
could
not
see

arwen
vanimelda
namri

he
said
and
then
he
drew
a
breath
and
returning
out
of
his
thought
he
looked
at
frodo
and
smiled

here
is
the
heart
of
elvendom
on
earth'
he
said
and
here
my
heart
dwells
ever
unless
there
be
a
light
beyond
the
dark
roads
that
we
still
must
tread
you
and
I
come
with
me
'
and
taking
frodo's
hand
in
his
he
left
the
hill
of
cerin
amroth
and
came
there
never
again
as
living
man



chapter
7


the
mirror
of
galadriel


the
sun
was
sinking
behind
the
mountains
and
the
shadows
were
deepening
in
the
woods
when
they
went
on
again
their
paths
now
went
into
thickets
where
the
dusk
had
already
gathered
night
came
beneath
the
trees
as
they
walked
and
the
elves
uncovered
their
silver
lamps

suddenly
they
came
out
into
the
open
again
and
found
themselves
under
a
pale
evening
sky
pricked
by
a
few
early
stars
there
was
a
wide
treeless
space
before
them
running
in
a
great
circle
and
bending
away
on
either
hand
beyond
it
was
a
deep
fosse
lost
in
soft
shadow
but
the
grass
upon
its
brink
was
green
as
if
it
glowed
still
in
memory
of
the
sun
that
had
gone
upon
the
further
side
there
rose
to
a
great
height
a
green
wall
encircling
a
green
hill
thronged
with
mallorntrees
taller
than
any
they
had
yet
seen
in
all
the
land
their
height
could
not
be
guessed
but
they
stood
up
in
the
twilight
like
living
towers
in
their
manytiered
branches
and
amid
their
evermoving
leaves
countless
lights
were
gleaming
green
and
gold
and
silver
haldir
turned
towards
the
company

welcome
to
caras
galadhon
'
he
said
'here
is
the
city
of
the
galadhrim
where
dwell
the
lord
celeborn
and
galadriel
the
lady
of
lrien
but
we
cannot
enter
here
for
the
gates
do
not
look
northward
we
must
go
round
to
the
southern
side
and
the
way
is
not
short
for
the
city
is
great'

there
was
a
road
paved
with
white
stone
running
on
the
outer
brink
of
the
fosse
along
this
they
went
westward
with
the
city
ever
climbing
up
like
a
green
cloud
upon
their
left
and
as
the
night
deepened
more
lights
sprang
forth
until
all
the
hill
seemed
afire
with
stars
they
came
at
last
to
a
white
bridge
and
crossing
found
the
great
gates
of
the
city
they
faced
southwest
set
between
the
ends
of
the
encircling
wall
that
here
overlapped
and
they
were
tall
and
strong
and
hung
with
many
lamps

haldir
knocked
and
spoke
and
the
gates
opened
soundlessly
but
of
guards
frodo
could
see
no
sign
the
travellers
passed
within
and
the
gates
shut
behind
them
they
were
in
a
deep
lane
between
the
ends
of
the
wall
and
passing
quickly
through
it
they
entered
the
city
of
the
trees
no
folk
could
they
see
nor
hear
any
feet
upon
the
paths
but
there
were
many
voices
about
them
and
in
the
air
above
far
away
up
on
the
hill
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
singing
falling
from
on
high
like
soft
rain
upon
leaves

they
went
along
many
paths
and
climbed
many
stairs
until
they
came
to
the
high
places
and
saw
before
them
amid
a
wide
lawn
a
fountain
shimmering
it
was
lit
by
silver
lamps
that
swung
from
the
boughs
of
trees
and
it
fell
into
a
basin
of
silver
from
which
a
white
stream
spilled
upon
the
south
side
of
the
lawn
there
stood
the
mightiest
of
all
the
trees
its
great
smooth
bole
gleamed
like
grey
silk
and
up
it
towered
until
its
first
branches
far
above
opened
their
huge
limbs
under
shadowy
clouds
of
leaves
beside
it
a
broad
white
ladder
stood
and
at
its
foot
three
elves
were
seated
they
sprang
up
as
the
travellers
approached
and
frodo
saw
that
they
were
tall
and
clad
in
grey
mail
and
from
their
shoulders
hung
long
white
cloaks

'here
dwell
celeborn
and
galadriel'
said
haldir
it
is
their
wish
that
you
should
ascend
and
speak
with
them'

one
of
the
elfwardens
then
blew
a
clear
note
on
a
small
horn
and
it
was
answered
three
times
from
far
above
I
will
go
first'
said
haldir
'let
frodo
come
next
and
with
him
legolas
the
others
may
follow
as
they
wish
it
is
a
long
climb
for
those
that
are
not
accustomed
to
such
stairs
but
you
may
rest
upon
the
way'

as
he
climbed
slowly
up
frodo
passed
many
flets
some
on
one
side
some
on
another
and
some
set
about
the
bole
of
the
tree
so
that
the
ladder
passed
through
them
at
a
great
height
above
the
ground
he
came
to
a
wide

talan

like
the
deck
of
a
great
ship
on
it
was
built
a
house
so
large
that
almost
it
would
have
served
for
a
hall
of
men
upon
the
earth
he
entered
behind
haldir
and
found
that
he
was
in
a
chamber
of
oval
shape
in
the
midst
of
which
grew
the
trunk
of
the
great
mallorn
now
tapering
towards
its
crown
and
yet
making
still
a
pillar
of
wide
girth

the
chamber
was
filled
with
a
soft
light
its
walls
were
green
and
silver
and
its
roof
of
gold
many
elves
were
seated
there
on
two
chairs
beneath
the
bole
of
the
tree
and
canopied
by
a
living
bough
there
sat
side
by
side
celeborn
and
galadriel
they
stood
up
to
greet
their
guests
after
the
manner
of
elves
even
those
who
were
accounted
mighty
kings
very
tall
they
were
and
the
lady
no
less
tall
than
the
lord
and
they
were
grave
and
beautiful
they
were
clad
wholly
in
white
and
the
hair
of
the
lady
was
of
deep
gold
and
the
hair
of
the
lord
celeborn
was
of
silver
long
and
bright
but
no
sign
of
age
was
upon
them
unless
it
were
in
the
depths
of
their
eyes
for
these
were
keen
as
lances
in
the
starlight
and
yet
profound
the
wells
of
deep
memory

haldir
led
frodo
before
them
and
the
lord
welcomed
him
in
his
own
tongue
the
lady
galadriel
said
no
word
but
looked
long
upon
his
face

sit
now
beside
my
chair
frodo
of
the
shire
'
said
celeborn
when
all
have
come
we
will
speak
together'

each
of
the
companions
he
greeted
courteously
by
name
as
they
entered
welcome
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
'
he
said
it
is
eight
and
thirty
years
of
the
world
outside
since
you
came
to
this
land
and
those
years
lie
heavy
on
you
but
the
end
is
near
for
good
or
ill
here
lay
aside
your
burden
for
a
while
'

'welcome
son
of
thranduil
too
seldom
do
my
kindred
journey
hither
from
the
north'

welcome
gimli
son
of
glin
it
is
long
indeed
since
we
saw
one
of
durin's
folk
in
caras
galadhon
but
today
we
have
broken
our
long
law
may
it
be
a
sign
that
though
the
world
is
now
dark
better
days
are
at
hand
and
that
friendship
shall
be
renewed
between
our
peoples'
gimli
bowed
low

when
all
the
guests
were
seated
before
his
chair
the
lord
looked
at
them
again
'here
there
are
eight'
he
said
nine
were
to
set
out
so
said
the
messages
but
maybe
there
has
been
some
change
of
counsel
that
we
have
not
heard
elrond
is
far
away
and
darkness
gathers
between
us
and
all
this
year
the
shadows
have
grown
longer'

nay
there
was
no
change
of
counsel'
said
the
lady
galadriel
speaking
for
the
first
time
her
voice
was
clear
and
musical
but
deeper
than
woman's
wont
gandalf
the
grey
set
out
with
the
company
but
he
did
not
pass
the
borders
of
this
land
now
tell
us
where
he
is
for
I
much
desired
to
speak
with
him
again
but
I
cannot
see
him
from
afar
unless
he
comes
within
the
fences
of
lothlrien
a
grey
mist
is
about
him
and
the
ways
of
his
feet
and
of
his
mind
are
hidden
from
me'

'alas
'
said
aragorn
gandalf
the
grey
fell
into
shadow
he
remained
in
moria
and
did
not
escape'

at
these
words
all
the
elves
in
the
hall
cried
aloud
in
grief
and
amazement
these
are
evil
tidings'
said
celeborn
the
most
evil
that
have
been
spoken
here
in
long
years
full
of
grievous
deeds'
he
turned
to
haldir
why
has
nothing
of
this
been
told
to
me
before
'
he
asked
in
the
elventongue

'we
have
not
spoken
to
haldir
of
our
deeds
or
our
purpose'
said
legolas
at
first
we
were
weary
and
danger
was
too
close
behind
and
afterwards
we
almost
forgot
our
grief
for
a
time
as
we
walked
in
gladness
on
the
fair
paths
of
lrien'

yet
our
grief
is
great
and
our
loss
cannot
be
mended'
said
frodo
'gandalf
was
our
guide
and
he
led
us
through
moria
and
when
our
escape
seemed
beyond
hope
he
saved
us
and
he
fell'

'tell
us
now
the
full
tale
'
said
celeborn

then
aragorn
recounted
all
that
had
happened
upon
the
pass
of
caradhras
and
in
the
days
that
followed
and
he
spoke
of
balin
and
his
book
and
the
fight
in
the
chamber
of
mazarbul
and
the
fire
and
the
narrow
bridge
and
the
coming
of
the
terror
'an
evil
of
the
ancient
world
it
seemed
such
as
I
have
never
seen
before'
said
aragorn
it
was
both
a
shadow
and
a
flame
strong
and
terrible'

'it
was
a
balrog
of
morgoth'
said
legolas
of
all
elfbanes
the
most
deadly
save
the
one
who
sits
in
the
dark
tower'

indeed
I
saw
upon
the
bridge
that
which
haunts
our
darkest
dreams
l
saw
durin's
bane'
said
gimli
in
a
low
voice
and
dread
was
in
his
eyes

'alas
'
said
celeborn
we
long
have
feared
that
under
caradhras
a
terror
slept
but
had
I
known
that
the
dwarves
had
stirred
up
this
evil
in
moria
again
l
would
have
forbidden
you
to
pass
the
northern
borders
you
and
all
that
went
with
you
and
if
it
were
possible
one
would
say
that
at
the
last
gandalf
fell
from
wisdom
into
folly
going
needlessly
into
the
net
of
moria'

he
would
be
rash
indeed
that
said
that
thing'
said
galadriel
gravely
needless
were
none
of
the
deeds
of
gandalf
in
life
those
that
followed
him
knew
not
his
mind
and
cannot
report
his
full
purpose
but
however
it
may
be
with
the
guide
the
followers
are
blameless
do
not
repent
of
your
welcome
to
the
dwarf
if
our
folk
had
been
exiled
long
and
far
from
lothlrien
who
of
the
galadhrim
even
celeborn
the
wise
would
pass
nigh
and
would
not
wish
to
look
upon
their
ancient
home
though
it
had
become
an
abode
of
dragons

'dark
is
the
water
of
kheledzram
and
cold
are
the
springs
of
kibilnla
and
fair
were
the
manypillared
halls
of
khazaddm
in
elder
days
before
the
fall
of
mighty
kings
beneath
the
stone'
she
looked
upon
gimli
who
sat
glowering
and
sad
and
she
smiled
and
the
dwarf
hearing
the
names
given
in
his
own
ancient
tongue
looked
up
and
met
her
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
looked
suddenly
into
the
heart
of
an
enemy
and
saw
there
love
and
understanding
wonder
came
into
his
face
and
then
he
smiled
in
answer

he
rose
clumsily
and
bowed
in
dwarffashion
saying
yet
more
fair
is
the
living
land
of
lrien
and
the
lady
galadriel
is
above
all
the
jewels
that
lie
beneath
the
earth
'

there
was
a
silence
at
length
celeborn
spoke
again
I
did
not
know
that
your
plight
was
so
evil'
he
said
let
gimli
forget
my
harsh
words
I
spoke
in
the
trouble
of
my
heart
I
will
do
what
I
can
to
aid
you
each
according
to
his
wish
and
need
but
especially
that
one
of
the
little
folk
who
bears
the
burden'

'your
quest
is
known
to
us'
said
galadriel
looking
at
frodo
but
we
will
not
here
speak
of
it
more
openly
yet
not
in
vain
will
it
prove
maybe
that
you
came
to
this
land
seeking
aid
as
gandalf
himself
plainly
purposed
for
the
lord
of
the
galadhrim
is
accounted
the
wisest
of
the
elves
of
middleearth
and
a
giver
of
gifts
beyond
the
power
of
kings
he
has
dwelt
in
the
west
since
the
days
of
dawn
and
I
have
dwelt
with
him
years
uncounted
for
ere
the
fall
of
nargothrond
or
gondolin
I
passed
over
the
mountains
and
together
through
ages
of
the
world
we
have
fought
the
long
defeat

'i
it
was
who
first
summoned
the
white
council
and
if
my
designs
had
not
gone
amiss
it
would
have
been
governed
by
gandalf
the
grey
and
then
mayhap
things
would
have
gone
otherwise
but
even
now
there
is
hope
left
I
will
not
give
you
counsel
saying
do
this
or
do
that
for
not
in
doing
or
contriving
nor
in
choosing
between
this
course
and
another
can
I
avail
but
only
in
knowing
what
was
and
is
and
in
part
also
what
shall
be
but
this
I
will
say
to
you
your
quest
stands
upon
the
edge
of
a
knife
stray
but
a
little
and
it
will
fail
to
the
ruin
of
all
yet
hope
remains
while
all
the
company
is
true'

and
with
that
word
she
held
them
with
her
eyes
and
in
silence
looked
searchingly
at
each
of
them
in
turn
none
save
legolas
and
aragorn
could
long
endure
her
glance
sam
quickly
blushed
and
hung
his
head

at
length
the
lady
galadriel
released
them
from
her
eyes
and
she
smiled
do
not
let
your
hearts
be
troubled'
she
said
'tonight
you
shall
sleep
in
peace'
then
they
sighed
and
felt
suddenly
weary
as
those
who
have
been
questioned
long
and
deeply
though
no
words
had
been
spoken
openly


go
now
'
said
celeborn
you
are
worn
with
sorrow
and
much
toil
even
if
your
quest
did
not
concern
us
closely
you
should
have
refuge
in
this
city
until
you
were
healed
and
refreshed
now
you
shall
rest
and
we
will
not
speak
of
your
further
road
for
a
while'

that
night
the
company
slept
upon
the
ground
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
hobbits
the
elves
spread
for
them
a
pavilion
among
the
trees
near
the
fountain
and
in
it
they
laid
soft
couches
then
speaking
words
of
peace
with
fair
elvish
voices
they
left
them
for
a
little
while
the
travellers
talked
of
their
night
before
in
the
treetops
and
of
their
day's
journey
and
of
the
lord
and
lady
for
they
had
not
yet
the
heart
to
look
further
back

what
did
you
blush
for
sam
'
said
pippin
you
soon
broke
down
anyone
would
have
thought
you
had
a
guilty
conscience
I
hope
it
was
nothing
worse
than
a
wicked
plot
to
steal
one
of
my
blankets'

I
never
thought
no
such
thing'
answered
sam
in
no
mood
for
jest
'if
you
want
to
know
I
felt
as
if
I
hadn't
got
nothing
on
and
I
didn't
like
it
she
seemed
to
be
looking
inside
me
and
asking
me
what
I
would
do
if
she
gave
me
the
chance
of
flying
back
home
to
the
shire
to
a
nice
little
hole
withwith
a
bit
of
garden
of
my
own'

that's
funny'
said
merry
'almost
exactly
what
I
felt
myself
only
only
well
I
don't
think
i'ii
say
any
more'
he
ended
lamely

all
of
them
it
seemed
had
fared
alike
each
had
felt
that
he
was
offered
a
choice
between
a
shadow
full
of
fear
that
lay
ahead
and
something
that
he
greatly
desired
clear
before
his
mind
it
lay
and
to
get
it
he
had
only
to
turn
aside
from
the
road
and
leave
the
quest
and
the
war
against
sauron
to
others

and
it
seemed
to
me
too'
said
gimli
that
my
choice
would
remain
secret
and
known
only
to
myself'

'to
me
it
seemed
exceedingly
strange'
said
boromir
maybe
it
was
only
a
test
and
she
thought
to
read
our
thoughts
for
her
own
good
purpose
but
almost
I
should
have
said
that
she
was
tempting
us
and
offering
what
she
pretended
to
have
the
power
to
give
it
need
not
be
said
that
I
refused
to
listen
the
men
of
minas
tirith
are
true
to
their
word'
but
what
he
thought
that
the
lady
had
offered
him
boromir
did
not
tell

and
as
for
frodo
he
would
not
speak
though
boromir
pressed
him
with
questions
she
held
you
long
in
her
gaze
ringbearer'
he
said

yes'
said
frodo
but
whatever
came
into
my
mind
then
I
will
keep
there'

well
have
a
care
'
said
boromir
I
do
not
feel
too
sure
of
this
elvish
lady
and
her
purposes'

speak
no
evil
of
the
lady
galadriel
'
said
aragorn
sternly
'you
know
not
what
you
say
there
is
in
her
and
in
this
land
no
evil
unless
a
man
bring
it
hither
himself
then
let
him
beware
but
tonight
I
shall
sleep
without
fear
for
the
first
time
since
I
left
rivendell
and
may
I
sleep
deep
and
forget
for
a
while
my
grief
I
am
weary
in
body
and
in
heart'
he
cast
himself
down
upon
his
couch
and
fell
at
once
into
a
long
sleep

the
others
soon
did
the
same
and
no
sound
or
dream
disturbed
their
slumber
when
they
woke
they
found
that
the
light
of
day
was
broad
upon
the
lawn
before
the
pavilion
and
the
fountain
rose
and
fell
glittering
in
the
sun

they
remained
some
days
in
lothlrien
so
far
as
they
could
tell
or
remember
all
the
while
that
they
dwelt
there
the
sun
shone
clear
save
for
a
gentle
rain
that
fell
at
times
and
passed
away
leaving
all
things
fresh
and
clean
the
air
was
cool
and
soft
as
if
it
were
early
spring
yet
they
felt
about
them
the
deep
and
thoughtful
quiet
of
winter
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
did
little
but
eat
and
drink
and
rest
and
walk
among
the
trees
and
it
was
enough

they
had
not
seen
the
lord
and
lady
again
and
they
had
little
speech
with
the
elvenfolk
for
few
of
these
knew
or
would
use
the
westron
tongue
haldir
had
bidden
them
farewell
and
gone
back
again
to
the
fences
of
the
north
where
great
watch
was
now
kept
since
the
tidings
of
moria
that
the
company
had
brought
legolas
was
away
much
among
the
galadhrim
and
after
the
first
night
he
did
not
sleep
with
the
other
companions
though
he
returned
to
eat
and
talk
with
them

often
he
took
gimli
with
him
when
he
went
abroad
in
the
land
and
the
others
wondered
at
this
change

now
as
the
companions
sat
or
walked
together
they
spoke
of
gandalf
and
all
that
each
had
known
and
seen
of
him
came
clear
before
their
minds
as
they
were
healed
of
hurt
and
weariness
of
body
the
grief
of
their
loss
grew
more
keen
often
they
heard
nearby
elvish
voices
singing
and
knew
that
they
were
making
songs
of
lamentation
for
his
fall
for
they
caught
his
name
among
the
sweet
sad
words
that
they
could
not
understand


mithrandir
mithrandir

sang
the
elves

o
pilgrim
grey
for
so
they
loved
to
call
him
but
if
legolas
was
with
the
company
he
would
not
interpret
the
songs
for
them
saying
that
he
had
not
the
skill
and
that
for
him
the
grief
was
still
too
near
a
matter
for
tears
and
not
yet
for
song

it
was
frodo
who
first
put
something
of
his
sorrow
into
halting
words
he
was
seldom
moved
to
make
song
or
rhyme
even
in
rivendell
he
had
listened
and
had
not
sung
himself
though
his
memory
was
stored
with
many
things
that
others
had
made
before
him
but
now
as
he
sat
beside
the
fountain
in
lrien
and
heard
about
him
the
voices
of
the
elves
his
thought
took
shape
in
a
song
that
seemed
fair
to
him
yet
when
he
tried
to
repeat
it
to
sam
only
snatches
remained
faded
as
a
handful
of
withered
leaves

when
evening
in
the
shire
was
grey

his
footsteps
on
the
hill
were
heard

before
the
dawn
he
went
away

on
journey
long
without
a
word


from
wilderland
to
western
shore

from
northern
waste
to
southern
hill

through
dragonlair
and
hidden
door

and
darkling
woods
he
walked
at
will


with
dwarf
and
hobbit
elves
and
men

with
mortal
and
immortal
folk

with
bird
on
bough
and
beast
in
den

in
their
own
secret
tongues
he
spoke


a
deadly
sword
a
healing
hand

a
back
that
bent
beneath
its
load

a
trumpetvoice
a
burning
brand

a
weary
pilgrim
on
the
road


a
lord
of
wisdom
throned
he
sat

swift
in
anger
quick
to
laugh

an
old
man
in
a
battered
hat

who
leaned
upon
a
thorny
staff


he
stood
upon
the
bridge
alone

and
fire
and
shadow
both
defied

his
staff
was
broken
on
the
stone

in
khazaddm
his
wisdom
died


why
you'll
be
beating
mr
bilbo
next
'
said
sam

'no
I
am
afraid
not'
said
frodo
'but
that
is
the
best
I
can
do
yet'



'well
mr
frodo
if
you
do
have
another
go
I
hope
you'll
say
a
word
about
his
fireworks'
said
sam
something
like
this

the
finest
rockets
ever
seen

they
burst
in
stars
of
blue
and
green

or
after
thunder
golden
showers

came
falling
like
a
rain
of
flowers

though
that
doesn't
do
them
justice
by
a
long
road'

no
i'll
leave
that
to
you
sam
or
perhaps
to
bilbo
butwell
I
can't
talk
of
it
any
more
I
can't
bear
to
think
of
bringing
the
news
to
him'

one
evening
frodo
and
sam
were
walking
together
in
the
cool
twilight
both
of
them
felt
restless
again
on
frodo
suddenly
the
shadow
of
parting
had
fallen
he
knew
somehow
that
the
time
was
very
near
when
he
must
leave
lothlrien

what
do
you
think
of
elves
now
sam
'
he
said
I
asked
you
the
same
question
once
beforeit
seems
a
very
long
while
ago
but
you
have
seen
more
of
them
since
then'

'i
have
indeed
'
said
sam
'and
I
reckon
there's
elves
and
elves
they're
all
elvish
enough
but
they're
not
all
the
same
now
these
folk
aren't
wanderers
or
homeless
and
seem
a
bit
nearer
to
the
likes
of
us
they
seem
to
belong
here
more
even
than
hobbits
do
in
the
shire
whether
they've
made
the
land
or
the
land's
made
them
it's
hard
to
say
if
you
take
my
meaning
it's
wonderfully
quiet
here
nothing
seems
to
be
going
on
and
nobody
seems
to
want
it
to
if
there's
any
magic
about
it's
right
down
deep
where
I
can't
lay
my
hands
on
it
in
a
manner
of
speaking'

'you
can
see
and
feel
it
everywhere'
said
frodo

'well'
said
sam
'you
can't
see
nobody
working
it
no
fireworks
like
poor
gandalf
used
to
show
I
wonder
we
don't
see
nothing
of
the
lord
and
lady
in
all
these
days
I
fancy
now
that

she

could
do
some
wonderful
things
if
she
had
a
mind
i'd
dearly
love
to
see
some
elfmagic
mr
frodo
'

'i
wouldn't'
said
frodo
I
am
content
and
I
don't
miss
gandalf's
fireworks
but
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
his
quick
temper
and
his
voice'

you're
right'
said
sam
and
don't
think
i'm
finding
fault
i've
often
wanted
to
see
a
bit
of
magic
like
what
it
tells
of
in
old
tales
but
i've
never
heard
of
a
better
land
than
this
it's
like
being
at
home
and
on
a
holiday
at
the
same
time
if
you
understand
me
I
don't
want
to
leave
all
the
same
i'm
beginning
to
feel
that
if
we've
got
to
go
on
then
we'd
best
get
it
over

'
it's
the
job
that's
never
started
as
takes
longest
to
finish

as
my
old
gaffer
used
to
say
and
I
don't
reckon
that
these
folk
can
do
much
more
to
help
us
magic
or
no
it's
when
we
leave
this
land
that
we
shall
miss
gandalf
worse
i'm
thinking'

'i
am
afraid
that's
only
too
true
sam'
said
frodo
yet
I
hope
very
much
that
before
we
leave
we
shall
see
the
lady
of
the
elves
again'

even
as
he
spoke
they
saw
as
if
she
came
in
answer
to
their
words
the
lady
galadriel
approaching
tall
and
white
and
fair
she
walked
beneath
the
trees
she
spoke
no
word
but
beckoned
to
them

turning
aside
she
led
them
toward
the
southern
slopes
of
the
hill
of
caras
galadhon
and
passing
through
a
high
green
hedge
they
came
into
an
enclosed
garden
no
trees
grew
there
and
it
lay
open
to
the
sky
the
evening
star
had
risen
and
was
shining
with
white
fire
above
the
western
woods
down
a
long
flight
of
steps
the
lady
went
into
a
deep
green
hollow
through
which
ran
murmuring
the
silver
stream
that
issued
from
the
fountain
on
the
hill
at
the
bottom
upon
a
low
pedestal
carved
like
a
branching
tree
stood
a
basin
of
silver
wide
and
shallow
and
beside
it
stood
a
silver
ewer

with
water
from
the
stream
galadriel
filled
the
basin
to
the
brim
and
breathed
on
it
and
when
the
water
was
still
again
she
spoke
here
is
the
mirror
of
galadriel'
she
said
'i
have
brought
you
here
so
that
you
may
look
in
it
if
you
will'


the
air
was
very
still
and
the
dell
was
dark
and
the
elflady
beside
him
was
tall
and
pale
'what
shall
we
look
for
and
what
shall
we
see
'
asked
frodo
filled
with
awe

many
things
I
can
command
the
mirror
to
reveal'
she
answered
and
to
some
I
can
show
what
they
desire
to
see
but
the
mirror
will
also
show
things
unbidden
and
those
are
often
stranger
and
more
profitable
than
things
which
we
wish
to
behold
what
you
will
see
if
you
leave
the
mirror
free
to
work
I
cannot
tell
for
it
shows
things
that
were
and
things
that
are
things
that
yet
may
be
but
which
it
is
that
he
sees
even
the
wisest
cannot
always
tell
do
you
wish
to
look
'

frodo
did
not
answer

and
you
'
she
said
turning
to
sam
'for
this
is
what
your
folk
would
call
magic
I
believe
though
I
do
not
understand
clearly
what
they
mean
and
they
seem
also
to
use
the
same
word
of
the
deceits
of
the
enemy
but
this
if
you
will
is
the
magic
of
galadriel
did
you
not
say
that
you
wished
to
see
elfmagic
'

'i
did'
said
sam
trembling
a
little
between
fear
and
curiosity
i'll
have
a
peep
lady
if
you're
willing'

and
i'd
not
mind
a
glimpse
of
what's
going
on
at
home'
he
said
in
an
aside
to
frodo
'it
seems
a
terrible
long
time
that
i've
been
away
but
there
like
as
not
i'll
only
see
the
stars
or
something
that
I
won't
understand'

'like
as
not'
said
the
lady
with
a
gentle
laugh
but
come
you
shall
look
and
see
what
you
may
do
not
touch
the
water
'

sam
climbed
up
on
the
foot
of
the
pedestal
and
leaned
over
the
basin
the
water
looked
hard
and
dark
stars
were
reflected
in
it

there's
only
stars
as
I
thought'
he
said
then
he
gave
a
low
gasp
for
the
stars
went
out
as
if
a
dark
veil
had
been
withdrawn
the
mirror
grew
grey
and
then
clear
there
was
sun
shining
and
the
branches
of
trees
were
waving
and
tossing
in
the
wind
but
before
sam
could
make
up
his
mind
what
it
was
that
he
saw
the
light
faded
and
now
he
thought
he
saw
frodo
with
a
pale
face
lying
fast
asleep
under
a
great
dark
cliff
then
he
seemed
to
see
himself
going
along
a
dim
passage
and
climbing
an
endless
winding
stair
it
came
to
him
suddenly
that
he
was
looking
urgently
for
something
but
what
it
was
he
did
not
know
like
a
dream
the
vision
shifted
and
went
back
and
he
saw
the
trees
again
but
this
time
they
were
not
so
close
and
he
could
see
what
was
going
on
they
were
not
waving
in
the
wind
they
were
falling
crashing
to
the
ground

hi'
cried
sam
in
an
outraged
voice
'there's
that
ted
sandyman
acutting
down
trees
as
he
shouldn't
they
didn't
ought
to
be
felled
it's
that
avenue
beyond
the
mill
that
shades
the
road
to
bywater
I
wish
I
could
get
at
ted
and
i'd
fell

him
'

but
now
sam
noticed
that
the
old
mill
had
vanished
and
a
large
redbrick
building
was
being
put
up
where
it
had
stood
lots
of
folk
were
busily
at
work
there
was
a
tall
red
chimney
nearby
black
smoke
seemed
to
cloud
the
surface
of
the
mirror

'there's
some
devilry
at
work
in
the
shire'
he
said
'elrond
knew
what
he
was
about
when
he
wanted
to
send
mr
merry
back'
then
suddenly
sam
gave
a
cry
and
sprang
away
'i
can't
stay
here'
he
said
wildly
I
must
go
home
they've
dug
up
bagshot
row
and
there's
the
poor
old
gaffer
going
down
the
hill
with
his
bits
of
things
on
a
barrow
I
must
go
home
'

'you
cannot
go
home
alone'
said
the
lady
'you
did
not
wish
to
go
home
without
your
master
before
you
looked
in
the
mirror
and
yet
you
knew
that
evil
things
might
well
be
happening
in
the
shire
remember
that
the
mirror
shows
many
things
and
not
all
have
yet
come
to
pass
some
never
come
to
be
unless
those
that
behold
the
visions
turn
aside
from
their
path
to
prevent
them
the
mirror
is
dangerous
as
a
guide
of
deeds'

sam
sat
on
the
ground
and
put
his
head
in
his
hands
I
wish
I
had
never
come
here
and
I
don't
want
to
see
no
more
magic'
he
said
and
fell
silent
after
a
moment
he
spoke
again
thickly
as
if
struggling
with
tears
no
i'll
go
home
by
the
long
road
with
mr
frodo
or
not
at
all'
he
said
but
I
hope
I
do
get
back
some
day
if
what
i've
seen
turns
out
true
somebody's
going
to
catch
it
hot
'


do
you
now
wish
to
look
frodo
'
said
the
lady
galadriel
you
did
not
wish
to
see
elfmagic
and
were
content'

do
you
advise
me
to
look
'
asked
frodo

'no'
she
said
I
do
not
counsel
you
one
way
or
the
other
I
am
not
a
counsellor
you
may
learn
something
and
whether
what
you
see
be
fair
or
evil
that
may
be
profitable
and
yet
it
may
not
seeing
is
both
good
and
perilous
yet
I
think
frodo
that
you
have
courage
and
wisdom
enough
for
the
venture
or
I
would
not
have
brought
you
here
do
as
you
will
'

I
will
look'
said
frodo
and
he
climbed
on
the
pedestal
and
bent
over
the
dark
water
at
once
the
mirror
cleared
and
he
saw
a
twilit
land
mountains
loomed
dark
in
the
distance
against
a
pale
sky
a
long
grey
road
wound
back
out
of
sight
far
away
a
figure
came
slowly
down
the
road
faint
and
small
at
first
but
growing
larger
and
clearer
as
it
approached
suddenly
frodo
realized
that
it
reminded
him
of
gandalf
he
almost
called
aloud
the
wizard's
name
and
then
he
saw
that
the
figure
was
clothed
not
in
grey
but
in
white
in
a
white
that
shone
faintly
in
the
dusk
and
in
its
hand
there
was
a
white
staff
the
head
was
so
bowed
that
he
could
see
no
face
and
presently
the
figure
turned
aside
round
a
bend
in
the
road
and
went
out
of
the
mirror's
view
doubt
came
into
frodo's
mind
was
this
a
vision
of
gandalf
on
one
of
his
many
lonely
journeys
long
ago
or
was
it
saruman

the
vision
now
changed
brief
and
small
but
very
vivid
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
bilbo
walking
restlessly
about
his
room
the
table
was
littered
with
disordered
papers
rain
was
beating
on
the
windows

then
there
was
a
pause
and
after
it
many
swift
scenes
followed
that
frodo
in
some
way
knew
to
be
parts
of
a
great
history
in
which
he
had
become
involved
the
mist
cleared
and
he
saw
a
sight
which
he
had
never
seen
before
but
knew
at
once
the
sea
darkness
fell
the
sea
rose
and
raged
in
a
great
storm
then
he
saw
against
the
sun
sinking
bloodred
into
a
wrack
of
clouds
the
black
outline
of
a
tall
ship
with
torn
sails
riding
up
out
of
the
west
then
a
wide
river
flowing
through
a
populous
city
then
a
white
fortress
with
seven
towers
and
then
again
a
ship
with
black
sails
but
now
it
was
morning
again
and
the
water
rippled
with
light
and
a
banner
bearing
the
emblem
of
a
white
tree
shone
in
the
sun
a
smoke
as
of
fire
and
battle
arose
and
again
the
sun
went
down
in
a
burning
red
that
faded
into
a
grey
mist
and
into
the
mist
a
small
ship
passed
away
twinkling
with
lights
it
vanished
and
frodo
sighed
and
prepared
to
draw
away

but
suddenly
the
mirror
went
altogether
dark
as
dark
as
if
a
hole
had
opened
in
the
world
of
sight
and
frodo
looked
into
emptiness
in
the
black
abyss
there
appeared
a
single
eye
that
slowly
grew
until
it
filled
nearly
all
the
mirror
so
terrible
was
it
that
frodo
stood
rooted
unable
to
cry
out
or
to
withdraw
his
gaze
the
eye
was
rimmed
with
fire
but
was
itself
glazed
yellow
as
a
cat's
watchful
and
intent
and
the
black
slit
of
its
pupil
opened
on
a
pit
a
window
into
nothing

then
the
eye
began
to
rove
searching
this
way
and
that
and
frodo
knew
with
certainty
and
horror
that
among
the
many
things
that
it
sought
he
himself
was
one
but
he
also
knew
that
it
could
not
see
himnot
yet
not
unless
he
willed
it
the
ring
that
hung
upon
its
chain
about
his
neck
grew
heavy
heavier
than
a
great
stone
and
his
head
was
dragged
downwards
the
mirror
seemed
to
be
growing
hot
and
curls
of
steam
were
rising
from
the
water
he
was
slipping
forward

do
not
touch
the
water'
said
the
lady
galadriel
softly
the
vision
faded
and
frodo
found
that
he
was
looking
at
the
cool
stars
twinkling
in
the
silver
basin
he
stepped
back
shaking
all
over
and
looked
at
the
lady

I
know
what
it
was
that
you
last
saw'
she
said
for
that
is
also
in
my
mind
do
not
be
afraid
but
do
not
think
that
only
by
singing
amid
the
trees
nor
even
by
the
slender
arrows
of
elvenbows
is
this
land
of
lothlrien
maintained
and
defended
against
its
enemy
I
say
to
you
frodo
that
even
as
I
speak
to
you
I
perceive
the
dark
lord
and
know
his
mind
or
all
of
his
mind
that
concerns
the
elves
and
he
gropes
ever
to
see
me
and
my
thought
but
still
the
door
is
closed
'

she
lifted
up
her
white
arms
and
spread
out
her
hands
towards
the
east
in
a
gesture
of
rejection
and
denial
erendil
the
evening
star
most
beloved
of
the
elves
shone
clear
above
so
bright
was
it
that
the
figure
of
the
elvenlady
cast
a
dim
shadow
on
the
ground
its
rays
glanced
upon
a
ring
about
her
finger
it
glittered
like
polished
gold
overlaid
with
silver
light
and
a
white
stone
in
it
twinkled
as
if
the
evenstar
had
come
down
to
rest
upon
her
hand
frodo
gazed
at
the
ring
with
awe
for
suddenly
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
understood

yes'
she
said
divining
his
thought
it
is
not
permitted
to
speak
of
it
and
elrond
could
not
do
so
but
it
cannot
be
hidden
from
the
ringbearer
and
one
who
has
seen
the
eye
verily
it
is
in
the
land
of
lrien
upon
the
finger
of
galadriel
that
one
of
the
three
remains
this
is
nenya
the
ring
of
adamant
and
I
am
its
keeper

he
suspects
but
he
does
not
know

not
yet
do
you
not
see
now
wherefore
your
coming
is
to
us
as
the
footstep
of
doom
for
if
you
fail
then
we
are
laid
bare
to
the
enemy
yet
if
you
succeed
then
our
power
is
diminished
and
lothlrien
will
fade
and
the
tides
of
time
will
sweep
it
away
we
must
depart
into
the
west
or
dwindle
to
a
rustic
folk
of
dell
and
cave
slowly
to
forget
and
to
be
forgotten'

frodo
bent
his
head
and
what
do
you
wish
'
he
said
at
last

that
what
should
be
shall
be'
she
answered
the
love
of
the
elves
for
their
land
and
their
works
is
deeper
than
the
deeps
of
the
sea
and
their
regret
is
undying
and
cannot
ever
wholly
be
assuaged
yet
they
will
cast
all
away
rather
than
submit
to
sauron
for
they
know
him
now
for
the
fate
of
lothlrien
you
are
not
answerable
but
only
for
the
doing
of
your
own
task
yet
I
could
wish
were
it
of
any
avail
that
the
one
ring
had
never
been
wrought
or
had
remained
for
ever
lost'

'you
are
wise
and
fearless
and
fair
lady
galadriel'
said
frodo
I
will
give
you
the
one
ring
if
you
ask
for
it
it
is
too
great
a
matter
for
me'

galadriel
laughed
with
a
sudden
clear
laugh
wise
the
lady
galadriel
may
be'
she
said
yet
here
she
has
met
her
match
in
courtesy
gently
are
you
revenged
for
my
testing
of
your
heart
at
our
first
meeting
you
begin
to
see
with
a
keen
eye
I
do
not
deny
that
my
heart
has
greatly
desired
to
ask
what
you
offer
for
many
long
years
I
had
pondered
what
I
might
do
should
the
great
ring
come
into
my
hands
and
behold
it
was
brought
within
my
grasp
the
evil
that
was
devised
long
ago
works
on
in
many
ways
whether
sauron
himself
stands
or
falls
would
not
that
have
been
a
noble
deed
to
set
to
the
credit
of
his
ring
if
I
had
taken
it
by
force
or
fear
from
my
guest

and
now
at
last
it
comes
you
will
give
me
the
ring
freely
in
place
of
the
dark
lord
you
will
set
up
a
queen
and
I
shall
not
be
dark
but
beautiful
and
terrible
as
the
morning
and
the
night
fair
as
the
sea
and
the
sun
and
the
snow
upon
the
mountain
dreadful
as
the
storm
and
the
lightning
stronger
than
the
foundations
of
the
earth
all
shall
love
me
and
despair
'

she
lifted
up
her
hand
and
from
the
ring
that
she
wore
there
issued
a
great
light
that
illuminated
her
alone
and
left
all
else
dark
she
stood
before
frodo
seeming
now
tall
beyond
measurement
and
beautiful
beyond
enduring
terrible
and
worshipful
then
she
let
her
hand
fall
and
the
light
faded
and
suddenly
she
laughed
again
and
lo
she
was
shrunken
a
slender
elfwoman
clad
in
simple
white
whose
gentle
voice
was
soft
and
sad

'i
pass
the
test'
she
said
I
will
diminish
and
go
into
the
west
and
remain
galadriel'

they
stood
for
a
long
while
in
silence
at
length
the
lady
spoke
again
let
us
return
'
she
said
in
the
morning
you
must
depart
for
now
we
have
chosen
and
the
tides
of
fate
are
flowing'

I
would
ask
one
thing
before
we
go'
said
frodo
a
thing
which
I
often
meant
to
ask
gandalf
in
rivendell
I
am
permitted
to
wear
the
one
ring
why
cannot
I
see
all
the
others
and
know
the
thoughts
of
those
that
wear
them
'

you
have
not
tried'
she
said
only
thrice
have
you
set
the
ring
upon
your
finger
since
you
knew
what
you
possessed
do
not
try
it
would
destroy
you
did
not
gandalf
tell
you
that
the
rings
give
power
according
to
the
measure
of
each
possessor
before
you
could
use
that
power
you
would
need
to
become
far
stronger
and
to
train
your
will
to
the
domination
of
others
yet
even
so
as
ringbearer
and
as
one
that
has
borne
it
on
finger
and
seen
that
which
is
hidden
your
sight
is
grown
keener
you
have
perceived
my
thought
more
clearly
than
many
that
are
accounted
wise

you
saw
the
eye
of
him
that
holds
the
seven
and
the
nine
and
did
you
not
see
and
recognize
the
ring
upon
my
finger
did
you
see
my
ring
'
she
asked
turning
again
to
sam

'no
lady'
he
answered
to
tell
you
the
truth
I
wondered
what
you
were
talking
about
I
saw
a
star
through
your
finger
but
if
you'll
pardon
my
speaking
out
I
think
my
master
was
right
I
wish
you'd
take
his
ring
you'd
put
things
to
rights
you'd
stop
them
digging
up
the
gaffer
and
turning
him
adrift
you'd
make
some
folk
pay
for
their
dirty
work'

I
would'
she
said
that
is
how
it
would
begin
but
it
would
not
stop
with
that
alas
we
will
not
speak
more
of
it
let
us
go'


chapter
8


farewell
to
lrien


that
night
the
company
was
again
summoned
to
the
chamber
of
celeborn
and
there
the
lord
and
lady
greeted
them
with
fair
words
at
length
celeborn
spoke
of
their
departure

now
is
the
time'
he
said
when
those
who
wish
to
continue
the
quest
must
harden
their
hearts
to
leave
this
land
those
who
no
longer
wish
to
go
forward
may
remain
here
for
a
while
but
whether
they
stay
or
go
none
can
be
sure
of
peace
for
we
are
come
now
to
the
edge
of
doom
here
those
who
wish
may
await
the
oncoming
of
the
hour
till
either
the
ways
of
the
world
lie
open
again
or
we
summon
them
to
the
last
need
of
lrien
then
they
may
return
to
their
own
lands
or
else
go
to
the
long
home
of
those
that
fall
in
battle'

there
was
a
silence
they
all
resolved
to
go
forward'
said
galadriel
looking
in
their
eyes

as
for
me'
said
boromir
my
way
home
lies
onward
and
not
back'

that
is
true'
said
celeborn
but
is
all
this
company
going
with
you
to
minas
tirith
'

we
have
not
decided
our
course'
said
aragorn
'beyond
lothlrien
I
do
not
know
what
gandalf
intended
to
do
indeed
I
do
not
think
that
even
he
had
any
clear
purpose'

maybe
not'
said
celeborn
yet
when
you
leave
this
land
you
can
no
longer
forget
the
great
river
as
some
of
you
know
well
it
cannot
be
crossed
by
travellers
with
baggage
between
lrien
and
gondor
save
by
boat
and
are
not
the
bridges
of
osgiliath
broken
down
and
all
the
landings
held
now
by
the
enemy

on
which
side
will
you
journey
the
way
to
minas
tirith
lies
upon
this
side
upon
the
west
but
the
straight
road
of
the
quest
lies
east
of
the
river
upon
the
darker
shore
which
shore
will
you
now
take
'

if
my
advice
is
heeded
it
will
be
the
western
shore
and
the
way
to
minas
tirith'
answered
boromir
but
I
am
not
the
leader
of
the
company'
the
others
said
nothing
and
aragorn
looked
doubtful
and
troubled

I
see
that
you
do
not
yet
know
what
to
do'
said
celeborn
it
is
not
my
part
to
choose
for
you
but
I
will
help
you
as
I
may
there
are
some
among
you
who
can
handle
boats
legolas
whose
folk
know
the
swift
forest
river
and
boromir
of
gondor
and
aragorn
the
traveller'

and
one
hobbit
'
cried
merry
not
all
of
us
look
on
boats
as
wild
horses
my
people
live
by
the
banks
of
the
brandywine'

that
is
well'
said
celeborn
then
I
will
furnish
your
company
with
boats
they
must
be
small
and
light
for
if
you
go
far
by
water
there
are
places
where
you
will
be
forced
to
carry
them
you
will
come
to
the
rapids
of
sarn
gebir
and
maybe
at
last
to
the
great
falls
of
rauros
where
the
river
thunders
down
from
nen
hithoel
and
there
are
other
perils
boats
may
make
your
journey
less
toilsome
for
a
while
yet
they
will
not
give
you
counsel
in
the
end
you
must
leave
them
and
the
river
and
turn
westor
east'

aragorn
thanked
celeborn
many
times
the
gift
of
boats
comforted
him
much
not
least
because
there
would
now
be
no
need
to
decide
his
course
for
some
days
the
others
too
looked
more
hopeful
whatever
perils
lay
ahead
it
seemed
better
to
float
down
the
broad
tide
of
anduin
to
meet
them
than
to
plod
forward
with
bent
backs
only
sam
was
doubtful
he
at
any
rate
still
thought
boats
as
bad
as
wild
horses
or
worse
and
not
all
the
dangers
that
he
had
survived
made
him
think
better
of
them

all
shall
be
prepared
for
you
and
await
you
at
the
haven
before
noon
tomorrow'
said
celeborn
'i
will
send
my
people
to
you
in
the
morning
to
help
you
make
ready
for
the
journey
now
we
will
wish
you
all
a
fair
night
and
untroubled
sleep'

'good
night
my
friends
'
said
galadriel
'sleep
in
peace
do
not
trouble
your
hearts
overmuch
with
thought
of
the
road
tonight
maybe
the
paths
that
you
each
shall
tread
are
already
laid
before
your
feet
though
you
do
not
see
them
good
night
'

the
company
now
took
their
leave
and
returned
to
their
pavilion
legolas
went
with
them
for
this
was
to
be
their
last
night
in
lothlrien
and
in
spite
of
the
words
of
galadriel
they
wished
to
take
counsel
together

for
a
long
time
they
debated
what
they
should
do
and
how
it
would
be
best
to
attempt
the
fulfilling
of
their
purpose
with
the
ring
but
they
came
to
no
decision
it
was
plain
that
most
of
them
desired
to
go
first
to
minas
tirith
and
to
escape
at
least
for
a
while
from
the
terror
of
the
enemy
they
would
have
been
willing
to
follow
a
leader
over
the
river
and
into
the
shadow
of
mordor
but
frodo
spoke
no
word
and
aragorn
was
still
divided
in
his
mind

his
own
plan
while
gandalf
remained
with
them
had
been
to
go
with
boromir
and
with
his
sword
help
to
deliver
gondor
for
he
believed
that
the
message
of
the
dreams
was
a
summons
and
that
the
hour
had
come
at
last
when
the
heir
of
elendil
should
come
forth
and
strive
with
sauron
for
the
mastery
but
in
moria
the
burden
of
gandalf
had
been
laid
on
him
and
he
knew
that
he
could
not
now
forsake
the
ring
if
frodo
refused
in
the
end
to
go
with
boromir
and
yet
what
help
could
he
or
any
of
the
company
give
to
frodo
save
to
walk
blindly
with
him
into
the
darkness

I
shall
go
to
minas
tirith
alone
if
need
be
for
it
is
my
duty'
said
boromir
and
after
that
he
was
silent
for
a
while
sitting
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
frodo
as
if
he
was
trying
to
read
the
halfling's
thoughts
at
length
he
spoke
again
softly
as
if
he
was
debating
with
himself
if
you
wish
only
to
destroy
the
ring'
he
said
then
there
is
little
use
in
war
and
weapons
and
the
men
of
minas
tirith
cannot
help
but
if
you
wish
to
destroy
the
armed
might
of
the
dark
lord
then
it
is
folly
to
go
without
force
into
his
domain
and
folly
to
throw
away'
he
paused
suddenly
as
if
he
had
become
aware
that
he
was
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
it
would
be
folly
to
throw
lives
away
I
mean'
he
ended
it
is
a
choice
between
defending
a
strong
place
and
walking
openly
into
the
arms
of
death
at
least
that
is
how
I
see
it'

frodo
caught
something
new
and
strange
in
boromir's
glance
and
he
looked
hard
at
him
plainly
boromir's
thought
was
different
from
his
final
words
it
would
be
folly
to
throw
away
what
the
ring
of
power
he
had
said
something
like
this
at
the
council
but
then
he
had
accepted
the
correction
of
elrond
frodo
looked
at
aragorn
but
he
seemed
deep
in
his
own
thought
and
made
no
sign
that
he
had
heeded
boromir's
words
and
so
their
debate
ended
merry
and
pippin
were
already
asleep
and
sam
was
nodding
the
night
was
growing
old

in
the
morning
as
they
were
beginning
to
pack
their
slender
goods
elves
that
could
speak
their
tongue
came
to
them
and
brought
them
many
gifts
of
food
and
clothing
for
the
journey
the
food
was
mostly
in
the
form
of
very
thin
cakes
made
of
a
meal
that
was
baked
a
light
brown
on
the
outside
and
inside
was
the
colour
of
cream
gimli
took
up
one
of
the
cakes
and
looked
at
it
with
a
doubtful
eye


cram
'
he
said
under
his
breath
as
he
broke
off
a
crisp
corner
and
nibbled
at
it
his
expression
quickly
changed
and
he
ate
all
the
rest
of
the
cake
with
relish

no
more
no
more'
cried
the
elves
laughing
you
have
eaten
enough
already
for
a
long
day's
march'

I
thought
it
was
only
a
kind
of

cram

such
as
the
dalemen
make
for
journeys
in
the
wild'
said
the
dwarf


so
it
is'
they
answered
but
we
call
it

lembas

or
waybread
and
it
is
more
strengthening
than
any
food
made
by
men
and
it
is
more
pleasant
than

cram

by
all
accounts'

indeed
it
is'
said
gimli
'why
it
is
better
than
the
honeycakes
of
the
beornings
and
that
is
great
praise
for
the
beornings
are
the
best
bakers
that
I
know
of
but
they
are
none
too
willing
to
deal
out
their
cakes
to
travellers
in
these
days
you
are
kindly
hosts
'

'all
the
same
we
bid
you
spare
the
food'
they
said
'eat
little
at
a
time
and
only
at
need
for
these
things
are
given
to
serve
you
when
all
else
fails
the
cakes
will
keep
sweet
for
many
many
days
if
they
are
unbroken
and
left
in
their
leafwrappings
as
we
have
brought
them
one
will
keep
a
traveller
on
his
feet
for
a
day
of
long
labour
even
if
he
be
one
of
the
tall
men
of
minas
tirith'

the
elves
next
unwrapped
and
gave
to
each
of
the
company
the
clothes
they
had
brought
for
each
they
had
provided
a
hood
and
cloak
made
according
to
his
size
of
the
light
but
warm
silken
stuff
that
the
galadhrim
wove
it
was
hard
to
say
of
what
colour
they
were
grey
with
the
hue
of
twilight
under
the
trees
they
seemed
to
be
and
yet
if
they
were
moved
or
set
in
another
light
they
were
green
as
shadowed
leaves
or
brown
as
fallow
fields
by
night
dusksilver
as
water
under
the
stars
each
cloak
was
fastened
about
the
neck
with
a
brooch
like
a
green
leaf
veined
with
silver

are
these
magic
cloaks
'
asked
pippin
looking
at
them
with
wonder

I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
that'
answered
the
leader
of
the
elves
they
are
fair
garments
and
the
web
is
good
for
it
was
made
in
this
land
they
are
elvish
robes
certainly
if
that
is
what
you
mean
leaf
and
branch
water
and
stone
they
have
the
hue
and
beauty
of
all
these
things
under
the
twilight
of
lrien
that
we
love
for
we
put
the
thought
of
all
that
we
love
into
all
that
we
make
yet
they
are
garments
not
armour
and
they
will
not
turn
shaft
or
blade
but
they
should
serve
you
well
they
are
light
to
wear
and
warm
enough
or
cool
enough
at
need
and
you
will
find
them
a
great
aid
in
keeping
out
of
the
sight
of
unfriendly
eyes
whether
you
walk
among
the
stones
or
the
trees
you
are
indeed
high
in
the
favour
of
the
lady
for
she
herself
and
her
maidens
wove
this
stuff
and
never
before
have
we
clad
strangers
in
the
garb
of
our
own
people'

after
their
morning
meal
the
company
said
farewell
to
the
lawn
by
the
fountain
their
hearts
were
heavy
for
it
was
a
fair
place
and
it
had
become
like
home
to
them
though
they
could
not
count
the
days
and
nights
that
they
had
passed
there
as
they
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
white
water
in
the
sunlight
haldir
came
walking
towards
them
over
the
green
grass
of
the
glade
frodo
greeted
him
with
delight

'i
have
returned
from
the
northern
fences'
said
the
elf
and
I
am
sent
now
to
be
your
guide
again
the
dimrill
dale
is
full
of
vapour
and
clouds
of
smoke
and
the
mountains
are
troubled
there
are
noises
in
the
deeps
of
the
earth
if
any
of
you
had
thought
of
returning
northwards
to
your
homes
you
would
not
have
been
able
to
pass
that
way
but
come
your
path
now
goes
south'

as
they
walked
through
caras
galadhon
the
green
ways
were
empty
but
in
the
trees
above
them
many
voices
were
murmuring
and
singing
they
themselves
went
silently
at
last
haldir
led
them
down
the
southward
slopes
of
the
hill
and
they
came
again
to
the
great
gate
hung
with
lamps
and
to
the
white
bridge
and
so
they
passed
out
and
left
the
city
of
the
elves
then
they
turned
away
from
the
paved
road
and
took
a
path
that
went
off
into
a
deep
thicket
of
mallorntrees
and
passed
on
winding
through
rolling
woodlands
of
silver
shadow
leading
them
ever
down
southwards
and
eastwards
towards
the
shores
of
the
river

they
had
gone
some
ten
miles
and
noon
was
at
hand
when
they
came
on
a
high
green
wall
passing
through
an
opening
they
came
suddenly
out
of
the
trees
before
them
lay
a
long
lawn
of
shining
grass
studded
with
golden

elanor

that
glinted
in
the
sun
the
lawn
ran
out
into
a
narrow
tongue
between
bright
margins
on
the
right
and
west
the
silverlode
flowed
glittering
on
the
left
and
east
the
great
river
rolled
its
broad
waters
deep
and
dark
on
the
further
shores
the
woodlands
still
marched
on
southwards
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
but
all
the
banks
were
bleak
and
bare
no
mallorn
lifted
its
goldhung
boughs
beyond
the
land
of
lrien

on
the
bank
of
the
silverlode
at
some
distance
up
from
the
meeting
of
the
streams
there
was
a
hythe
of
white
stones
and
white
wood
by
it
were
moored
many
boats
and
barges
some
were
brightly
painted
and
shone
with
silver
and
gold
and
green
but
most
were
either
white
or
grey
three
small
grey
boats
had
been
made
ready
for
the
travellers
and
in
these
the
elves
stowed
their
goods
and
they
added
also
coils
of
rope
three
to
each
boat
slender
they
looked
but
strong
silken
to
the
touch
grey
of
hue
like
the
elvencloaks

what
are
these
'
asked
sam
handling
one
that
lay
upon
the
greensward

ropes
indeed
'
answered
an
elf
from
the
boats
'never
travel
far
without
a
rope
and
one
that
is
long
and
strong
and
light
such
are
these
they
may
be
a
help
in
many
needs'

'you
don't
need
to
tell
me
that
'
said
sam
I
came
without
any
and
i've
been
worried
ever
since
but
I
was
wondering
what
these
were
made
of
knowing
a
bit
about
ropemaking
it's
in
the
family
as
you
might
say'

they
are
made
of

hithlain
'
said
the
elf
but
there
is
no
time
now
to
instruct
you
in
the
art
of
their
making
had
we
known
that
this
craft
delighted
you
we
could
have
taught
you
much
but
now
alas
unless
you
should
at
some
time
return
hither
you
must
be
content
with
our
gift
may
it
serve
you
well
'

come
'
said
haldir
all
is
now
ready
for
you
enter
the
boats
but
take
care
at
first
'

'heed
the
words
'
said
the
other
elves
'these
boats
are
lightbuilt
and
they
are
crafty
and
unlike
the
boats
of
other
folk
they
will
not
sink
lade
them
as
you
will
but
they
are
wayward
if
mishandled
it
would
be
wise
if
you
accustomed
yourselves
to
stepping
in
and
out
here
where
there
is
a
landingplace
before
you
set
off
downstream'

the
company
was
arranged
in
this
way
aragorn
frodo
and
sam
were
in
one
boat
boromir
merry
and
pippin
in
another
and
in
the
third
were
legolas
and
gimli
who
had
now
become
fast
friends
in
this
last
boat
most
of
the
goods
and
packs
were
stowed
the
boats
were
moved
and
steered
with
shorthandled
paddles
that
had
broad
leafshaped
blades
when
all
was
ready
aragorn
led
them
on
a
trial
up
the
silverlode
the
current
was
swift
and
they
went
forward
slowly
sam
sat
in
the
bows
clutching
the
sides
and
looking
back
wistfully
to
the
shore
the
sunlight
glittering
on
the
water
dazzled
his
eyes
as
they
passed
beyond
the
green
field
of
the
tongue
the
trees
drew
down
to
the
river's
brink
here
and
there
golden
leaves
tossed
and
floated
on
the
rippling
stream
the
air
was
very
bright
and
still
and
there
was
a
silence
except
for
the
high
distant
song
of
larks

they
turned
a
sharp
bend
in
the
river
and
there
sailing
proudly
down
the
stream
toward
them
they
saw
a
swan
of
great
size
the
water
rippled
on
either
side
of
the
white
breast
beneath
its
curving
neck
its
beak
shone
like
burnished
gold
and
its
eyes
glinted
like
jet
set
in
yellow
stones
its
huge
white
wings
were
half
lifted
a
music
came
down
the
river
as
it
drew
nearer
and
suddenly
they
perceived
that
it
was
a
ship
wrought
and
carved
with
elvenskill
in
the
likeness
of
a
bird
two
elves
clad
in
white
steered
it
with
black
paddles
in
the
midst
of
the
vessel
sat
celeborn
and
behind
him
stood
galadriel
tall
and
white
a
circlet
of
golden
flowers
was
in
her
hair
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
harp
and
she
sang
sad
and
sweet
was
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
the
cool
clear
air

I
sang
of
leaves
of
leaves
of
gold
and
leaves
of
gold
there
grew

of
wind
I
sang
a
wind
there
came
and
in
the
branches
blew

beyond
the
sun
beyond
the
moon
the
foam
was
on
the
sea

and
by
the
strand
of
ilmarin
there
grew
a
golden
tree

beneath
the
stars
of
evereve
in
eldamar
it
shone

in
eldamar
beside
the
walls
of
elven
tirion

there
long
the
golden
leaves
have
grown
upon
the
branching
years

while
here
beyond
the
sundering
seas
now
fall
the
elventears

o
lrien
the
winter
comes
the
bare
and
leafless
day

the
leaves
are
falling
in
the
stream
the
river
flows
away

o
lrien
too
long
I
have
dwelt
upon
this
hither
shore

and
in
a
fading
crown
have
twined
the
golden
elanor

but
if
of
ships
I
now
should
sing
what
ship
would
come
to
me



what
ship
would
bear
me
ever
back
across
so
wide
a
sea

aragorn
stayed
his
boat
as
the
swanship
drew
alongside
the
lady
ended
her
song
and
greeted
them
we
have
come
to
bid
you
our
last
farewell'
she
said
and
to
speed
you
with
blessings
from
our
land'

though
you
have
been
our
guests'
said
celeborn
you
have
not
yet
eaten
with
us
and
we
bid
you
therefore
to
a
parting
feast
here
between
the
flowing
waters
that
will
bear
you
far
from
lrien'

the
swan
passed
on
slowly
to
the
hythe
and
they
turned
their
boats
and
followed
it
there
in
the
last
end
of
egladil
upon
the
green
grass
the
parting
feast
was
held
but
frodo
ate
and
drank
little
heeding
only
the
beauty
of
the
lady
and
her
voice
she
seemed
no
longer
perilous
or
terrible
nor
filled
with
hidden
power
already
she
seemed
to
him
as
by
men
of
later
days
elves
still
at
times
are
seen
present
and
yet
remote
a
living
vision
of
that
which
has
already
been
left
far
behind
by
the
flowing
streams
of
time

after
they
had
eaten
and
drunk
sitting
upon
the
grass
celeborn
spoke
to
them
again
of
their
journey
and
lifting
his
hand
he
pointed
south
to
the
woods
beyond
the
tongue

as
you
go
down
the
water'
he
said
you
will
find
that
the
trees
will
fail
and
you
will
come
to
a
barren
country
there
the
river
flows
in
stony
vale
amid
high
moors
until
at
last
after
many
leagues
it
comes
to
the
tall
island
of
the
tindrock
that
we
call
tol
brandir
there
it
casts
its
arms
about
the
steep
shores
of
the
isle
and
falls
then
with
a
great
noise
and
smoke
over
the
cataracts
of
rauros
down
into
the
nindalf
the
wetwang
as
it
is
called
in
your
tongue
that
is
a
wide
region
of
sluggish
fen
where
the
stream
becomes
tortuous
and
much
divided
there
the
entwash
flows
in
by
many
mouths
from
the
forest
of
fangorn
in
the
west
about
that
stream
on
this
side
of
the
great
river
lies
rohan
on
the
further
side
are
the
bleak
hills
of
the
emyn
muil
the
wind
blows
from
the
east
there
for
they
look
out
over
the
dead
marshes
and
the
nomanlands
to
cirith
gorgor
and
the
black
gates
of
mordor

'boromir
and
any
that
go
with
him
seeking
minas
tirith
will
do
well
to
leave
the
great
river
above
rauros
and
cross
the
entwash
before
it
finds
the
marshes
yet
they
should
not
go
too
far
up
that
stream
nor
risk
becoming
entangled
in
the
forest
of
fangorn
that
is
a
strange
land
and
is
now
little
known
but
boromir
and
aragorn
doubtless
do
not
need
this
warning'

'indeed
we
have
heard
of
fangorn
in
minas
tirith'
said
boromir
but
what
I
have
heard
seems
to
me
for
the
most
part
old
wives'
tales
such
as
we
tell
to
our
children
all
that
lies
north
of
rohan
is
now
to
us
so
far
away
that
fancy
can
wander
freely
there
of
old
fangorn
lay
upon
the
borders
of
our
realm
but
it
is
now
many
lives
of
men
since
any
of
us
visited
it
to
prove
or
disprove
the
legends
that
have
come
down
from
distant
years

I
have
myself
been
at
whiles
in
rohan
but
I
have
never
crossed
it
northwards
when
I
was
sent
out
as
a
messenger
I
passed
through
the
gap
by
the
skirts
of
the
white
mountains
and
crossed
the
isen
and
the
greyflood
into
northerland
a
long
and
wearisome
journey
four
hundred
leagues
I
reckoned
it
and
it
took
me
many
months
for
I
lost
my
horse
at
tharbad
at
the
fording
of
the
greyflood
after
that
journey
and
the
road
I
have
trodden
with
this
company
I
do
not
much
doubt
that
I
shall
find
a
way
through
rohan
and
fangorn
too
if
need
be'

then
I
need
say
no
more'
said
celeborn
'but
do
not
despise
the
lore
that
has
come
down
from
distant
years
for
oft
it
may
chance
that
old
wives
keep
in
memory
word
of
things
that
once
were
needful
for
the
wise
to
know'

now
galadriel
rose
from
the
grass
and
taking
a
cup
from
one
of
her
maidens
she
filled
it
with
white
mead
and
gave
it
to
celeborn

'now
it
is
time
to
drink
the
cup
of
farewell'
she
said
drink
lord
of
the
galadhrim
and
let
not
your
heart
be
sad
though
night
must
follow
noon
and
already
our
evening
draweth
nigh'

then
she
brought
the
cup
to
each
of
the
company
and
bade
them
drink
and
farewell
but
when
they
had
drunk
she
commanded
them
to
sit
again
on
the
grass
and
chairs
were
set
for
her
and
for
celeborn
her
maidens
stood
silent
about
her
and
a
while
she
looked
upon
her
guests
at
last
she
spoke
again

'we
have
drunk
the
cup
of
parting'
she
said
and
the
shadows
fall
between
us
but
before
you
go
I
have
brought
in
my
ship
gifts
which
the
lord
and
lady
of
the
galadhrim
now
offer
you
in
memory
of
lothlrien'
then
she
called
to
each
in
turn

here
is
the
gift
of
celeborn
and
galadriel
to
the
leader
of
your
company'
she
said
to
aragorn
and
she
gave
him
a
sheath
that
had
been
made
to
fit
his
sword
it
was
overlaid
with
a
tracery
of
flowers
and
leaves
wrought
of
silver
and
gold
and
on
it
were
set
in
elven
runes
formed
of
many
gems
the
name
andril
and
the
lineage
of
the
sword

the
blade
that
is
drawn
from
this
sheath
shall
not
be
stained
or
broken
even
in
defeat'
she
said
but
is
there
aught
else
that
you
desire
of
me
at
our
parting
for
darkness
will
flow
between
us
and
it
may
be
that
we
shall
not
meet
again
unless
it
be
far
hence
upon
a
road
that
has
no
returning'

and
aragorn
answered
'lady
you
know
all
my
desire
and
long
held
in
keeping
the
only
treasure
that
I
seek
yet
it
is
not
yours
to
give
me
even
if
you
would
and
only
through
darkness
shall
I
come
to
it'

yet
maybe
this
will
lighten
your
heart'
said
galadriel
for
it
was
left
in
my
care
to
be
given
to
you
should
you
pass
through
this
land'
then
she
lifted
from
her
lap
a
great
stone
of
a
clear
green
set
in
a
silver
brooch
that
was
wrought
in
the
likeness
of
an
eagle
with
outspread
wings
and
as
she
held
it
up
the
gem
flashed
like
the
sun
shining
through
the
leaves
of
spring
this
stone
I
gave
to
celebran
my
daughter
and
she
to
hers
and
now
it
comes
to
you
as
a
token
of
hope
in
this
hour
take
the
name
that
was
foretold
for
you
elessar
the
elfstone
of
the
house
of
elendil
'

then
aragorn
took
the
stone
and
pinned
the
brooch
upon
his
breast
and
those
who
saw
him
wondered
for
they
had
not
marked
before
how
tall
and
kingly
he
stood
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
many
years
of
toil
had
fallen
from
his
shoulders
for
the
gifts
that
you
have
given
me
I
thank
you'
he
said
'o
lady
of
lrien
of
whom
were
sprung
celebran
and
arwen
evenstar
what
praise
could
I
say
more
'

the
lady
bowed
her
head
and
she
turned
then
to
boromir
and
to
him
she
gave
a
belt
of
gold
and
to
merry
and
pippin
she
gave
small
silver
belts
each
with
a
clasp
wrought
like
a
golden
flower
to
legolas
she
gave
a
bow
such
as
the
galadhrim
used
longer
and
stouter
than
the
bows
of
mirkwood
and
strung
with
a
string
of
elfhair
with
it
went
a
quiver
of
arrows

for
you
little
gardener
and
lover
of
trees'
she
said
to
sam
I
have
only
a
small
gift'
she
put
into
his
hand
a
little
box
of
plain
grey
wood
unadorned
save
for
a
single
silver
rune
upon
the
lid
here
is
set
g
for
galadriel'
she
said
but
also
it
may
stand
for
garden
in
your
tongue
in
this
box
there
is
earth
from
my
orchard
and
such
blessing
as
galadriel
has
still
to
bestow
is
upon
it
it
will
not
keep
you
on
your
road
nor
defend
you
against
any
peril
but
if
you
keep
it
and
see
your
home
again
at
last
then
perhaps
it
may
reward
you
though
you
should
find
all
barren
and
laid
waste
there
will
be
few
gardens
in
middleearth
that
will
bloom
like
your
garden
if
you
sprinkle
this
earth
there
then
you
may
remember
galadriel
and
catch
a
glimpse
far
off
of
lrien
that
you
have
seen
only
in
our
winter
for
our
spring
and
our
summer
are
gone
by
and
they
will
never
be
seen
on
earth
again
save
in
memory'

sam
went
red
to
the
ears
and
muttered
something
inaudible
as
he
clutched
the
box
and
bowed
as
well
as
he
could

and
what
gift
would
a
dwarf
ask
of
the
elves
'
said
galadriel
turning
to
gimli

none
lady'
answered
gimli
it
is
enough
for
me
to
have
seen
the
lady
of
the
galadhrim
and
to
have
heard
her
gentle
words'

hear
all
ye
elves
'
she
cried
to
those
about
her
let
none
say
again
that
dwarves
are
grasping
and
ungracious
yet
surely
gimli
son
of
glin
you
desire
something
that
I
could
give
name
it
I
bid
you
you
shall
not
be
the
only
guest
without
a
gift'

there
is
nothing
lady
galadriel'
said
gimli
bowing
low
and
stammering
nothing
unless
it
might
be

unless
it
is
permitted
to
ask
nay
to
name
a
single
strand
of
your
hair
which
surpasses
the
gold
of
the
earth
as
the
stars
surpass
the
gems
of
the
mine
I
do
not
ask
for
such
a
gift
but
you
commanded
me
to
name
my
desire'

the
elves
stirred
and
murmured
with
astonishment
and
celeborn
gazed
at
the
dwarf
in
wonder
but
the
lady
smiled
'it
is
said
that
the
skill
of
the
dwarves
is
in
their
hands
rather
than
in
their
tongues
'
she
said
yet
that
is
not
true
of
gimli
for
none
have
ever
made
to
me
a
request
so
bold
and
yet
so
courteous
and
how
shall
I
refuse
since
I
commanded
him
to
speak
but
tell
me
what
would
you
do
with
such
a
gift
'

treasure
it
lady'
he
answered
in
memory
of
your
words
to
me
at
our
first
meeting
and
if
ever
I
return
to
the
smithies
of
my
home
it
shall
be
set
in
imperishable
crystal
to
be
an
heirloom
of
my
house
and
a
pledge
of
good
will
between
the
mountain
and
the
wood
until
the
end
of
days'

then
the
lady
unbraided
one
of
her
long
tresses
and
cut
off
three
golden
hairs
and
laid
them
in
gimli's
hand
these
words
shall
go
with
the
gift'
she
said
I
do
not
foretell
for
all
foretelling
is
now
vain
on
the
one
hand
lies
darkness
and
on
the
other
only
hope
but
if
hope
should
not
fail
then
I
say
to
you
gimli
son
of
glin
that
your
hands
shall
flow
with
gold
and
yet
over
you
gold
shall
have
no
dominion

and
you
ringbearer'
she
said
turning
to
frodo
I
come
to
you
last
who
are
not
last
in
my
thoughts
for
you
I
have
prepared
this'
she
held
up
a
small
crystal
phial
it
glittered
as
she
moved
it
and
rays
of
white
light
sprang
from
her
hand
'in
this
phial'
she
said
is
caught
the
light
of
erendil's
star
set
amid
the
waters
of
my
fountain
it
will
shine
still
brighter
when
night
is
about
you
may
it
be
a
light
to
you
in
dark
places
when
all
other
lights
go
out
remember
galadriel
and
her
mirror
'

frodo
took
the
phial
and
for
a
moment
as
it
shone
between
them
he
saw
her
again
standing
like
a
queen
great
and
beautiful
but
no
longer
terrible
he
bowed
but
found
no
words
to
say

now
the
lady
arose
and
celeborn
led
them
back
to
the
hythe
a
yellow
noon
lay
on
the
green
land
of
the
tongue
and
the
water
glittered
with
silver
all
at
last
was
made
ready
the
company
took
their
places
in
the
boats
as
before
crying
farewell
the
elves
of
lrien
with
long
grey
poles
thrust
them
out
into
the
flowing
stream
and
the
rippling
waters
bore
them
slowly
away
the
travellers
sat
still
without
moving
or
speaking
on
the
green
bank
near
to
the
very
point
of
the
tongue
the
lady
galadriel
stood
alone
and
silent
as
they
passed
her
they
turned
and
their
eyes
watched
her
slowly
floating
away
from
them
for
so
it
seemed
to
them
lrien
was
slipping
backward
like
a
bright
ship
masted
with
enchanted
trees
sailing
on
to
forgotten
shores
while
they
sat
helpless
upon
the
margin
of
the
grey
and
leafless
world

even
as
they
gazed
the
silverlode
passed
out
into
the
currents
of
the
great
river
and
their
boats
turned
and
began
to
speed
southwards
soon
the
white
form
of
the
lady
was
small
and
distant
she
shone
like
a
window
of
glass
upon
a
far
hill
in
the
westering
sun
or
as
a
remote
lake
seen
from
a
mountain
a
crystal
fallen
in
the
lap
of
the
land
then
it
seemed
to
frodo
that
she
lifted
her
arms
in
a
final
farewell
and
far
but
piercingclear
on
the
following
wind
came
the
sound
of
her
voice
singing
but
now
she
sang
in
the
ancient
tongue
of
the
elves
beyond
the
sea
and
he
did
not
understand
the
words
fair
was
the
music
but
it
did
not
comfort
him

yet
as
is
the
way
of
elvish
words
they
remained
graven
in
his
memory
and
long
afterwards
he
interpreted
them
as
well
as
he
could
the
language
was
that
of
elvensong
and
spoke
of
things
little
known
on
middleearth

suddenly
the
river
swept
round
a
bend
and
the
banks
rose
upon
either
side
and
the
light
of
lrien
was
hidden
to
that
fair
land
frodo
never
came
again

the
travellers
now
turned
their
faces
to
the
journey
the
sun
was
before
them
and
their
eyes
were
dazzled
for
all
were
filled
with
tears
gimli
wept
openly

I
have
looked
the
last
upon
that
which
was
fairest'
he
said
to
legolas
his
companion
henceforward
I
will
call
nothing
fair
unless
it
be
her
gift'
he
put
his
hand
to
his
breast

tell
me
legolas
why
did
I
come
on
this
quest
little
did
I
know
where
the
chief
peril
lay
truly
elrond
spoke
saying
that
we
could
not
foresee
what
we
might
meet
upon
our
road
torment
in
the
dark
was
the
danger
that
I
feared
and
it
did
not
hold
me
back
but
I
would
not
have
come
had
I
known
the
danger
of
light
and
joy
now
I
have
taken
my
worst
wound
in
this
parting
even
if
I
were
to
go
this
night
straight
to
the
dark
lord
alas
for
gimli
son
of
glin
'

nay
'
said
legolas
alas
for
us
all
and
for
all
that
walk
the
world
in
these
afterdays
for
such
is
the
way
of
it
to
find
and
lose
as
it
seems
to
those
whose
boat
is
on
the
running
stream
but
I
count
you
blessed
gimli
son
of
glin
for
your
loss
you
suffer
of
your
own
free
will
and
you
might
have
chosen
otherwise
but
you
have
not
forsaken
your
companions
and
the
least
reward
that
you
shall
have
is
that
the
memory
of
lothlrien
shall
remain
ever
clear
and
unstained
in
your
heart
and
shall
neither
fade
nor
grow
stale'

maybe'
said
gimli
and
I
thank
you
for
your
words
true
words
doubtless
yet
all
such
comfort
is
cold
memory
is
not
what
the
heart
desires
that
is
only
a
mirror
be
it
clear
as
kheledzram
or
so
says
the
heart
of
gimli
the
dwarf
elves
may
see
things
otherwise
indeed
I
have
heard
that
for
them
memory
is
more
like
to
the
waking
world
than
to
a
dream
not
so
for
dwarves

'but
let
us
talk
no
more
of
it
look
to
the
boat
she
is
too
low
in
the
water
with
all
this
baggage
and
the
great
river
is
swift
I
do
not
wish
to
drown
my
grief
in
cold
water'
he
took
up
a
paddle
and
steered
towards
the
western
bank
following
aragorn's
boat
ahead
which
had
already
moved
out
of
the
middle
stream

so
the
company
went
on
their
long
way
down
the
wide
hurrying
waters
borne
ever
southwards
bare
woods
stalked
along
either
bank
and
they
could
not
see
any
glimpse
of
the
lands
behind
the
breeze
died
away
and
the
river
flowed
without
a
sound
no
voice
of
bird
broke
the
silence
the
sun
grew
misty
as
the
day
grew
old
until
it
gleamed
in
a
pale
sky
like
a
high
white
pearl
then
it
faded
into
the
west
and
dusk
came
early
followed
by
a
grey
and
starless
night
far
into
the
dark
quiet
hours
they
floated
on
guiding
their
boats
under
the
overhanging
shadows
of
the
western
woods
great
trees
passed
by
like
ghosts
thrusting
their
twisted
thirsty
roots
through
the
mist
down
into
the
water
it
was
dreary
and
cold
frodo
sat
and
listened
to
the
faint
lap
and
gurgle
of
the
river
fretting
among
the
treeroots
and
driftwood
near
the
shore
until
his
head
nodded
and
he
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep


chapter
9


the
great
river


frodo
was
roused
by
sam
he
found
that
he
was
lying
well
wrapped
under
tall
greyskinned
trees
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
woodlands
on
the
west
bank
of
the
great
river
anduin
he
had
slept
the
night
away
and
the
grey
of
morning
was
dim
among
the
bare
branches
gimli
was
busy
with
a
small
fire
near
at
hand

they
started
again
before
the
day
was
broad
not
that
most
of
the
company
were
eager
to
hurry
southwards
they
were
content
that
the
decision
which
they
must
make
at
latest
when
they
came
to
rauros
and
the
tindrock
isle
still
lay
some
days
ahead
and
they
let
the
river
bear
them
on
at
its
own
pace
having
no
desire
to
hasten
towards
the
perils
that
lay
beyond
whichever
course
they
took
in
the
end
aragorn
let
them
drift
with
the
stream
as
they
wished
husbanding
their
strength
against
weariness
to
come
but
he
insisted
that
at
least
they
should
start
early
each
day
and
journey
on
far
into
the
evening
for
he
felt
in
his
heart
that
time
was
pressing
and
he
feared
that
the
dark
lord
had
not
been
idle
while
they
lingered
in
lrien

nonetheless
they
saw
no
sign
of
an
enemy
that
day
nor
the
next
the
dull
grey
hours
passed
without
event
as
the
third
day
of
their
voyage
wore
on
the
lands
changed
slowly
the
trees
thinned
and
then
failed
altogether
on
the
eastern
bank
to
their
left
they
saw
long
formless
slopes
stretching
up
and
away
toward
the
sky
brown
and
withered
they
looked
as
if
fire
had
passed
over
them
leaving
no
living
blade
of
green
an
unfriendly
waste
without
even
a
broken
tree
or
a
bold
stone
to
relieve
the
emptiness
they
had
come
to
the
brown
lands
that
lay
vast
and
desolate
between
southern
mirkwood
and
the
hills
of
the
emyn
muil
what
pestilence
or
war
or
evil
deed
of
the
enemy
had
so
blasted
all
that
region
even
aragorn
could
not
tell

upon
the
west
to
their
right
the
land
was
treeless
also
but
it
was
flat
and
in
many
places
green
with
wide
plains
of
grass
on
this
side
of
the
river
they
passed
forests
of
great
reeds
so
tall
that
they
shut
out
all
view
to
the
west
as
the
little
boats
went
rustling
by
along
their
fluttering
borders
their
dark
withered
plumes
bent
and
tossed
in
the
light
cold
airs
hissing
softly
and
sadly
here
and
there
through
openings
frodo
could
catch
sudden
glimpses
of
rolling
meads
and
far
beyond
them
hills
in
the
sunset
and
away
on
the
edge
of
sight
a
dark
line
where
marched
the
southernmost
ranks
of
the
misty
mountains

there
was
no
sign
of
living
moving
things
save
birds
of
these
there
were
many
small
fowl
whistling
and
piping
in
the
reeds
but
they
were
seldom
seen
once
or
twice
the
travellers
heard
the
rush
and
whine
of
swanwings
and
looking
up
they
saw
a
great
phalanx
streaming
along
the
sky

swans
'
said
sam
and
mighty
big
ones
too
'

yes'
said
aragorn
'and
they
are
black
swans'

how
wide
and
empty
and
mournful
all
this
country
looks
'
said
frodo
I
always
imagined
that
as
one
journeyed
south
it
got
warmer
and
merrier
until
winter
was
left
behind
for
ever'

'but
we
have
not
journeyed
far
south
yet'
answered
aragorn
it
is
still
winter
and
we
are
far
from
the
sea
here
the
world
is
cold
until
the
sudden
spring
and
we
may
yet
have
snow
again
far
away
down
in
the
bay
of
belfalas
to
which
anduin
runs
it
is
warm
and
merry
maybe
or
would
be
but
for
the
enemy
but
here
we
are
not
above
sixty
leagues
I
guess
south
of
the
southfarthing
away
in
your
shire
hundreds
of
long
miles
yonder
you
are
looking
now
southwest
across
the
north
plains
of
the
riddermark
rohan
the
land
of
the
horselords
ere
long
we
shall
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
limlight
that
runs
down
from
fangorn
to
join
the
great
river
that
is
the
north
boundary
of
rohan
and
of
old
all
that
lay
between
limlight
and
the
white
mountains
belonged
to
the
rohirrim
it
is
a
rich
and
pleasant
land
and
its
grass
has
no
rival
but
in
these
evil
days
folk
do
not
dwell
by
the
river
or
ride
often
to
its
shores
anduin
is
wide
yet
the
orcs
can
shoot
their
arrows
far
across
the
stream
and
of
late
it
is
said
they
have
dared
to
cross
the
water
and
raid
the
herds
and
studs
of
rohan'

sam
looked
from
bank
to
bank
uneasily
the
trees
had
seemed
hostile
before
as
if
they
harboured
secret
eyes
and
lurking
dangers
now
he
wished
that
the
trees
were
still
there
he
felt
that
the
company
was
too
naked
afloat
in
little
open
boats
in
the
midst
of
shelterless
lands
and
on
a
river
that
was
the
frontier
of
war

in
the
next
day
or
two
as
they
went
on
borne
steadily
southwards
this
feeling
of
insecurity
grew
on
all
the
company
for
a
whole
day
they
took
to
their
paddles
and
hastened
forward
the
banks
slid
by
soon
the
river
broadened
and
grew
more
shallow
long
stony
beaches
lay
upon
the
east
and
there
were
gravelshoals
in
the
water
so
that
careful
steering
was
needed
the
brown
lands
rose
into
bleak
wolds
over
which
flowed
a
chill
air
from
the
east
on
the
other
side
the
meads
had
become
rolling
downs
of
withered
grass
amidst
a
land
of
fen
and
tussock
frodo
shivered
thinking
of
the
lawns
and
fountains
the
clear
sun
and
gentle
rains
of
lothlrien
there
was
little
speech
and
no
laughter
in
any
of
the
boats
each
member
of
the
company
was
busy
with
his
own
thoughts

the
heart
of
legolas
was
running
under
the
stars
of
a
summer
night
in
some
northern
glade
amid
the
beechwoods
gimli
was
fingering
gold
in
his
mind
and
wondering
if
it
were
fit
to
be
wrought
into
the
housing
of
the
lady's
gift
merry
and
pippin
in
the
middle
boat
were
ill
at
ease
for
boromir
sat
muttering
to
himself
sometimes
biting
his
nails
as
if
some
restlessness
or
doubt
consumed
him
sometimes
seizing
a
paddle
and
driving
the
boat
close
behind
aragorn's
then
pippin
who
sat
in
the
bow
looking
back
caught
a
queer
gleam
in
his
eye
as
he
peered
forward
gazing
at
frodo
sam
had
long
ago
made
up
his
mind
that
though
boats
were
maybe
not
as
dangerous
as
he
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
they
were
far
more
uncomfortable
than
even
he
had
imagined
he
was
cramped
and
miserable
having
nothing
to
do
but
stare
at
the
winterlands
crawling
by
and
the
grey
water
on
either
side
of
him
even
when
the
paddles
were
in
use
they
did
not
trust
sam
with
one

as
dusk
drew
down
on
the
fourth
day
he
was
looking
back
over
the
bowed
heads
of
frodo
and
aragorn
and
the
following
boats
he
was
drowsy
and
longed
for
camp
and
the
feel
of
earth
under
his
toes
suddenly
something
caught
his
sight
at
first
he
stared
at
it
listlessly
then
he
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
but
when
he
looked
again
he
could
not
see
it
any
more

that
night
they
camped
on
a
small
eyot
close
to
the
western
bank
sam
lay
rolled
in
blankets
beside
frodo
I
had
a
funny
dream
an
hour
or
two
before
we
stopped
mr
frodo'
he
said
or
maybe
it
wasn't
a
dream
funny
it
was
anyway'

well
what
was
it
'
said
frodo
knowing
that
sam
would
not
settle
down
until
he
had
told
his
tale
whatever
it
was
'i
haven't
seen
or
thought
of
anything
to
make
me
smile
since
we
left
lothlrien'

it
wasn't
funny
that
way
mr
frodo
it
was
queer
all
wrong
if
it
wasn't
a
dream
and
you
had
best
hear
it
it
was
like
this
I
saw
a
log
with
eyes
'

the
log's
all
right'
said
frodo
there
are
many
in
the
river
but
leave
out
the
eyes
'

that
I
won't'
said
sam

'twas
the
eyes
as
made
me
sit
up
so
to
speak
I
saw
what
I
took
to
be
a
log
floating
along
in
the
halflight
behind
gimli's
boat
but
I
didn't
give
much
heed
to
it
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
log
was
slowly
catching
us
up
and
that
was
peculiar
as
you
might
say
seeing
as
we
were
all
floating
on
the
stream
together
just
then
I
saw
the
eyes
two
pale
sort
of
points
shinylike
on
a
hump
at
the
near
end
of
the
log
what's
more
it
wasn't
a
log
for
it
had
paddlefeet
like
a
swan's
almost
only
they
seemed
bigger
and
kept
dipping
in
and
out
of
the
water

'that's
when
I
sat
right
up
and
rubbed
my
eyes
meaning
to
give
a
shout
if
it
was
still
there
when
I
had
rubbed
the
drowse
out
of
my
head
for
the
whateveritwas
was
coming
along
fast
now
and
getting
close
behind
gimli
but
whether
those
two
lamps
spotted
me
moving
and
staring
or
whether
I
came
to
my
senses
I
don't
know
when
I
looked
again
it
wasn't
there
yet
I
think
I
caught
a
glimpse
with
the
tail
ofmy
eye
as
the
saying
is
of
something
dark
shooting
under
the
shadow
of
the
bank
I
couldn't
see
no
more
eyes
though

I
said
to
myself
dreaming
again
sam
gamgee
I
said
and
I
said
no
more
just
then
but
i've
been
thinking
since
and
now
i'm
not
so
sure
what
do
you
make
of
it
mr
frodo
'

'i
should
make
nothing
of
it
but
a
log
and
the
dusk
and
sleep
in
your
eyes
sam
said
frodo
if
this
was
the
first
time
that
those
eyes
had
been
seen
but
it
isn't
I
saw
them
away
back
north
before
we
reached
lrien
and
I
saw
a
strange
creature
with
eyes
climbing
to
the
flet
that
night
haldir
saw
it
too
and
do
you
remember
the
report
of
the
elves
that
went
after
the
orcband
'

ah'
said
sam
I
do
and
I
remember
more
too
I
don't
like
my
thoughts
but
thinking
of
one
thing
and
another
and
mr
bilbo's
stories
and
all
I
fancy
I
could
put
a
name
on
the
creature
at
a
guess
a
nasty
name
gollum
maybe
'

yes
that
is
what
I
have
feared
for
some
time'
said
frodo
ever
since
the
night
on
the
flet
I
suppose
he
was
lurking
in
moria
and
picked
up
our
trail
then
but
I
hoped
that
our
stay
in
lrien
would
throw
him
off
the
scent
again
the
miserable
creature
must
have
been
hiding
in
the
woods
by
the
silverlode
watching
us
start
off
'

that's
about
it'
said
sam
and
we'd
better
be
a
bit
more
watchful
ourselves
or
we'll
feel
some
nasty
fingers
round
our
necks
one
of
these
nights
if
we
ever
wake
up
to
feel
anything
and
that's
what
I
was
leading
up
to
no
need
to
trouble
strider
or
the
others
tonight
i'll
keep
watch
I
can
sleep
tomorrow
being
no
more
than
luggage
in
a
boat
as
you
might
say'

I
might'
said
frodo
and
I
might
say
luggage
with
eyes
you
shall
watch
but
only
if
you
promise
to
wake
me
halfway
towards
morning
if
nothing
happens
before
then'

in
the
dead
hours
frodo
came
out
of
a
deep
dark
sleep
to
find
sam
shaking
him
it's
a
shame
to
wake
you'
whispered
sam
but
that's
what
you
said
there's
nothing
to
tell
or
not
much
I
thought
I
heard
some
soft
plashing
and
a
sniffing
noise
a
while
back
but
you
hear
a
lot
of
such
queer
sounds
by
a
river
at
night'

he
lay
down
and
frodo
sat
up
huddled
in
his
blankets
and
fought
off
his
sleep
minutes
or
hours
passed
slowly
and
nothing
happened
frodo
was
just
yielding
to
the
temptation
to
lie
down
again
when
a
dark
shape
hardly
visible
floated
close
to
one
of
the
moored
boats
a
long
whitish
hand
could
be
dimly
seen
as
it
shot
out
and
grabbed
the
gunwale
two
pale
lamplike
eyes
shone
coldly
as
they
peered
inside
and
then
they
lifted
and
gazed
up
at
frodo
on
the
eyot
they
were
not
more
than
a
yard
or
two
away
and
frodo
heard
the
soft
hiss
of
intaken
breath
he
stood
up
drawing
sting
from
its
sheath
and
faced
the
eyes
immediately
their
light
was
shut
off
there
was
another
hiss
and
a
splash
and
the
dark
logshape
shot
away
downstream
into
the
night
aragorn
stirred
in
his
sleep
turned
over
and
sat
up

'what
is
it
'
he
whispered
springing
up
and
coming
to
frodo
I
felt
something
in
my
sleep
why
have
you
drawn
your
sword
'

gollum'
answered
frodo
'or
at
least
so
I
guess'

ah
'
said
aragorn
so
you
know
about
our
little
footpad
do
you
he
padded
after
us
all
through
moria
and
right
down
to
nimrodel
since
we
took
to
boats
he
has
been
lying
on
a
log
and
paddling
with
hands
and
feet
I
have
tried
to
catch
him
once
or
twice
at
night
but
he
is
slier
than
a
fox
and
as
slippery
as
a
fish
I
hoped
the
rivervoyage
would
beat
him
but
he
is
too
clever
a
waterman

we
shall
have
to
try
going
faster
tomorrow
you
lie
down
now
and
I
will
keep
watch
for
what
is
left
of
the
night
I
wish
I
could
lay
my
hands
on
the
wretch
we
might
make
him
useful
but
if
I
cannot
we
shall
have
to
try
and
lose
him
he
is
very
dangerous
quite
apart
from
murder
by
night
on
his
own
account
he
may
put
any
enemy
that
is
about
on
our
track'

the
night
passed
without
gollum
showing
so
much
as
a
shadow
again
after
that
the
company
kept
a
sharp
lookout
but
they
saw
no
more
of
gollum
while
the
voyage
lasted
if
he
was
still
following
he
was
very
wary
and
cunning
at
aragorn's
bidding
they
paddled
now
for
long
spells
and
the
banks
went
swiftly
by
but
they
saw
little
of
the
country
for
they
journeyed
mostly
by
night
and
twilight
resting
by
day
and
lying
as
hidden
as
the
land
allowed
in
this
way
the
time
passed
without
event
until
the
seventh
day

the
weather
was
still
grey
and
overcast
with
wind
from
the
east
but
as
evening
drew
into
night
the
sky
away
westward
cleared
and
pools
of
faint
light
yellow
and
pale
green
opened
under
the
grey
shores
of
cloud
there
the
white
rind
of
the
new
moon
could
be
seen
glimmering
in
the
remote
lakes
sam
looked
at
it
and
puckered
his
brows

the
next
day
the
country
on
either
side
began
to
change
rapidly
the
banks
began
to
rise
and
grow
stony
soon
they
were
passing
through
a
hilly
rocky
land
and
on
both
shores
there
were
steep
slopes
buried
in
deep
brakes
of
thorn
and
sloe
tangled
with
brambles
and
creepers
behind
them
stood
low
crumbling
cliffs
and
chimneys
of
grey
weathered
stone
dark
with
ivy
and
beyond
these
again
there
rose
high
ridges
crowned
with
windwrithen
firs
they
were
drawing
near
to
the
grey
hillcountry
of
the
emyn
muil
the
southern
march
of
wilderland

there
were
many
birds
about
the
cliffs
and
the
rockchimneys
and
all
day
high
in
the
air
flocks
of
birds
had
been
circling
black
against
the
pale
sky
as
they
lay
in
their
camp
that
day
aragorn
watched
the
flights
doubtfully
wondering
if
gollum
had
been
doing
some
mischief
and
the
news
of
their
voyage
was
now
moving
in
the
wilderness
later
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
company
was
stirring
and
getting
ready
to
start
again
he
descried
a
dark
spot
against
the
fading
light
a
great
bird
high
and
far
off
now
wheeling
now
flying
on
slowly
southwards

'what
is
that
legolas
'
he
asked
pointing
to
the
northern
sky
'is
it
as
I
think
an
eagle
'

'yes'
said
legolas
it
is
an
eagle
a
hunting
eagle
I
wonder
what
that
forebodes
it
is
far
from
the
mountains'

we
will
not
start
until
it
is
fully
dark'
said
aragorn

the
eighth
night
of
their
journey
came
it
was
silent
and
windless
the
grey
east
wind
had
passed
away
the
thin
crescent
of
the
moon
had
fallen
early
into
the
pale
sunset
but
the
sky
was
clear
above
and
though
far
away
in
the
south
there
were
great
ranges
of
cloud
that
still
shone
faintly
in
the
west
stars
glinted
bright

come
'
said
aragorn
we
will
venture
one
more
journey
by
night
we
are
coming
to
reaches
of
the
river
that
I
do
not
know
well
for
I
have
never
journeyed
by
water
in
these
parts
before
not
between
here
and
the
rapids
of
sarn
gebir
but
if
I
am
right
in
my
reckoning
those
are
still
many
miles
ahead
still
there
are
dangerous
places
even
before
we
come
there
rocks
and
stony
eyots
in
the
stream
we
must
keep
a
sharp
watch
and
not
try
to
paddle
swiftly'

to
sam
in
the
leading
boat
was
given
the
task
of
watchman
he
lay
forward
peering
into
the
gloom
the
night
grew
dark
but
the
stars
above
were
strangely
bright
and
there
was
a
glimmer
on
the
face
of
the
river
it
was
close
on
midnight
and
they
had
been
drifting
for
some
while
hardly
using
the
paddles
when
suddenly
sam
cried
out
only
a
few
yards
ahead
dark
shapes
loomed
up
in
the
stream
and
he
heard
the
swirl
of
racing
water
there
was
a
swift
current
which
swung
left
towards
the
eastern
shore
where
the
channel
was
clear
as
they
were
swept
aside
the
travellers
could
see
now
very
close
the
pale
foam
of
the
river
lashing
against
sharp
rocks
that
were
thrust
out
far
into
the
stream
like
a
ridge
of
teeth
the
boats
were
all
huddled
together

hoy
there
aragorn
'
shouted
boromir
as
his
boat
bumped
into
the
leader
this
is
madness
we
cannot
dare
the
rapids
by
night
but
no
boat
can
live
in
sarn
gebir
be
it
night
or
day'

back
back
'
cried
aragorn
'turn
turn
if
you
can
'
he
drove
his
paddle
into
the
water
trying
to
hold
the
boat
and
bring
it
round


'i
am
out
of
my
reckoning'
he
said
to
frodo
'i
did
not
know
that
we
had
come
so
far
anduin
flows
faster
than
I
thought
sarn
gebir
must
be
close
at
hand
already'

with
great
efforts
they
checked
the
boats
and
slowly
brought
them
about
but
at
first
they
could
make
only
small
headway
against
the
current
and
all
the
time
they
were
carried
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
eastern
bank
now
dark
and
ominous
it
loomed
up
in
the
night

'all
together
paddle
'
shouted
boromir
'paddle
or
we
shall
be
driven
on
the
shoals'
even
as
he
spoke
frodo
felt
the
keel
beneath
him
grate
upon
stone

at
that
moment
there
was
a
twang
of
bowstrings
several
arrows
whistled
over
them
and
some
fell
among
them
one
smote
frodo
between
the
shoulders
and
he
lurched
forward
with
a
cry
letting
go
his
paddle
but
the
arrow
fell
back
foiled
by
his
hidden
coat
of
mail
another
passed
through
aragorn's
hood
and
a
third
stood
fast
in
the
gunwale
of
the
second
boat
close
by
merry's
hand
sam
thought
he
could
glimpse
black
figures
running
to
and
fro
upon
the
long
shinglebanks
that
lay
under
the
eastern
shore
they
seemed
very
near


yrch
'
said
legolas
falling
into
his
own
tongue

orcs
'
cried
gimli

gollum's
doing
i'll
be
bound'
said
sam
to
frodo
and
a
nice
place
to
choose
too
the
river
seems
set
on
taking
us
right
into
their
arms
'

they
all
leaned
forward
straining
at
the
paddles
even
sam
took
a
hand
every
moment
they
expected
to
feel
the
bite
of
blackfeathered
arrows
many
whined
overhead
or
struck
the
water
nearby
but
there
were
no
more
hits
it
was
dark
but
not
too
dark
for
the
nighteyes
of
orcs
and
in
the
starglimmer
they
must
have
offered
their
cunning
foes
some
mark
unless
it
was
that
the
grey
cloaks
of
lrien
and
the
grey
timber
of
the
elfwrought
boats
defeated
the
malice
of
the
archers
of
mordor

stroke
by
stroke
they
laboured
on
in
the
darkness
it
was
hard
to
be
sure
that
they
were
indeed
moving
at
all
but
slowly
the
swirl
of
the
water
grew
less
and
the
shadow
of
the
eastern
bank
faded
back
into
the
night
at
last
as
far
as
they
could
judge
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
stream
again
and
had
driven
their
boats
back
some
distance
above
the
jutting
rocks
then
half
turning
they
thrust
them
with
all
their
strength
towards
the
western
shore
under
the
shadow
of
bushes
leaning
out
over
the
water
they
halted
and
drew
breath

legolas
laid
down
his
paddle
and
took
up
the
bow
that
he
had
brought
from
lrien
then
he
sprang
ashore
and
climbed
a
few
paces
up
the
bank
stringing
the
bow
and
fitting
an
arrow
he
turned
peering
back
over
the
river
into
the
darkness
across
the
water
there
were
shrill
cries
but
nothing
could
be
seen

frodo
looked
up
at
the
elf
standing
tall
above
him
as
he
gazed
into
the
night
seeking
a
mark
to
shoot
at
his
head
was
dark
crowned
with
sharp
white
stars
that
glittered
in
the
black
pools
of
the
sky
behind
but
now
rising
and
sailing
up
from
the
south
the
great
clouds
advanced
sending
out
dark
outriders
into
the
starry
fields
a
sudden
dread
fell
on
the
company


elbereth
gilthoniel
'
sighed
legolas
as
he
looked
up
even
as
he
did
so
a
dark
shape
like
a
cloud
and
yet
not
a
cloud
for
it
moved
far
more
swiftly
came
out
of
the
blackness
in
the
south
and
sped
towards
the
company
blotting
out
all
light
as
it
approached
soon
it
appeared
as
a
great
winged
creature
blacker
than
the
pits
in
the
night
fierce
voices
rose
up
to
greet
it
from
across
the
water
frodo
felt
a
sudden
chill
running
through
him
and
clutching
at
his
heart
there
was
a
deadly
cold
like
the
memory
of
an
old
wound
in
his
shoulder
he
crouched
down
as
if
to
hide

suddenly
the
great
bow
of
lrien
sang
shrill
went
the
arrow
from
the
elvenstring
frodo
looked
up
almost
above
him
the
winged
shape
swerved
there
was
a
harsh
croaking
scream
as
it
fell
out
of
the
air
vanishing
down
into
the
gloom
of
the
eastern
shore
the
sky
was
clean
again
there
was
a
tumult
of
many
voices
far
away
cursing
and
wailing
in
the
darkness
and
then
silence
neither
shaft
nor
cry
came
again
from
the
east
that
night

after
a
while
aragorn
led
the
boats
back
upstream
they
felt
their
way
along
the
water's
edge
for
some
distance
until
they
found
a
small
shallow
bay
a
few
low
trees
grew
there
close
to
the
water
and
behind
them
rose
a
steep
rocky
bank
here
the
company
decided
to
stay
and
await
the
dawn
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
move
further
by
night
they
made
no
camp
and
lit
no
fire
but
lay
huddled
in
the
boats
moored
close
together

'praised
be
the
bow
of
galadriel
and
the
hand
and
eye
of
legolas
'
said
gimli
as
he
munched
a
wafer
of

lembas

'that
was
a
mighty
shot
in
the
dark
my
friend'

'but
who
can
say
what
it
hit'
said
legolas

'i
cannot'
said
gimli
but
I
am
glad
that
the
shadow
came
no
nearer
I
liked
it
not
at
all
too
much
it
reminded
me
of
the
shadow
in
moria

the
shadow
of
the
balrog'
he
ended
in
a
whisper

'it
was
not
a
balrog'
said
frodo
still
shivering
with
the
chill
that
had
come
upon
him
'it
was
something
colder
I
think
it
was
'
then
he
paused
and
fell
silent

'what
do
you
think
'
asked
boromir
eagerly
leaning
from
his
boat
as
if
he
was
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
frodo's
face

I
think

no
I
will
not
say'
answered
frodo
whatever
it
was
its
fall
has
dismayed
our
enemies'

so
it
seems'
said
aragorn
yet
where
they
are
and
how
many
and
what
they
will
do
next
we
do
not
know
this
night
we
must
all
be
sleepless
dark
hides
us
now
but
what
the
day
will
show
who
can
tell
have
your
weapons
close
to
hand
'

sam
sat
tapping
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
if
he
were
counting
on
his
fingers
and
looking
up
at
the
sky
it's
very
strange'
he
murmured
the
moon's
the
same
in
the
shire
and
in
wilderland
or
it
ought
to
be
but
either
it's
out
of
its
running
or
i'm
all
wrong
in
my
reckoning
you'll
remember
mr
frodo
the
moon
was
waning
as
we
lay
on
the
flet
up
in
that
tree
a
week
from
the
full
I
reckon
and
we'd
been
a
week
on
the
way
last
night
when
up
pops
a
new
moon
as
thin
as
a
nailparing
as
if
we
had
never
stayed
no
time
in
the
elvish
country

well
I
can
remember
three
nights
there
for
certain
and
I
seem
to
remember
several
more
but
I
would
take
my
oath
it
was
never
a
whole
month
anyone
would
think
that
time
did
not
count
in
there
'

and
perhaps
that
was
the
way
of
it'
said
frodo
in
that
land
maybe
we
were
in
a
time
that
has
elsewhere
long
gone
by
it
was
not
I
think
until
silverlode
bore
us
back
to
anduin
that
we
returned
to
the
time
that
flows
through
mortal
lands
to
the
great
sea
and
I
don't
remember
any
moon
either
new
or
old
in
caras
galadhon
only
stars
by
night
and
sun
by
day'

legolas
stirred
in
his
boat
nay
time
does
not
tarry
ever'
he
said
but
change
and
growth
is
not
in
all
things
and
places
alike
for
the
elves
the
world
moves
and
it
moves
both
very
swift
and
very
slow
swift
because
they
themselves
change
little
and
all
else
fleets
by
it
is
a
grief
to
them
slow
because
they
do
not
count
the
running
years
not
for
themselves
the
passing
seasons
are
but
ripples
ever
repeated
in
the
long
long
stream
yet
beneath
the
sun
all
things
must
wear
to
an
end
at
last'

but
the
wearing
is
slow
in
lrien'
said
frodo
the
power
of
the
lady
is
on
it
rich
are
the
hours
though
short
they
seem
in
caras
galadhon
where
galadriel
wields
the
elvenring'

'that
should
not
have
been
said
outside
lrien
not
even
to
me'
said
aragorn
speak
no
more
of
it
but
so
it
is
sam
in
that
land
you
lost
your
count
there
time
flowed
swiftly
by
us
as
for
the
elves
the
old
moon
passed
and
a
new
moon
waxed
and
waned
in
the
world
outside
while
we
tarried
there
and
yestereve
a
new
moon
came
again
winter
is
nearly
gone
time
flows
on
to
a
spring
of
little
hope'

the
night
passed
silently
no
voice
or
call
was
heard
again
across
the
water
the
travellers
huddled
in
their
boats
felt
the
changing
of
the
weather
the
air
grew
warm
and
very
still
under
the
great
moist
clouds
that
had
floated
up
from
the
south
and
the
distant
seas
the
rushing
of
the
river
over
the
rocks
of
the
rapids
seemed
to
grow
louder
and
closer
the
twigs
of
the
trees
above
them
began
to
drip


when
the
day
came
the
mood
of
the
world
about
them
had
become
soft
and
sad
slowly
the
dawn
grew
to
a
pale
light
diffused
and
shadowless
there
was
mist
on
the
river
and
white
fog
swathed
the
shore
the
far
bank
could
not
be
seen

I
can't
abide
fog'
said
sam
but
this
seems
to
be
a
lucky
one
now
perhaps
we
can
get
away
without
those
cursed
goblins
seeing
us'

perhaps
so'
said
aragorn
but
it
will
be
hard
to
find
the
path
unless
the
fog
lifts
a
little
later
on
and
we
must
find
the
path
if
we
are
to
pass
sarn
gebir
and
come
to
the
emyn
muil'

'i
do
not
see
why
we
should
pass
the
rapids
or
follow
the
river
any
further'
said
boromir
if
the
emyn
muil
lie
before
us
then
we
can
abandon
these
cockleboats
and
strike
westward
and
southward
until
we
come
to
the
entwash
and
cross
into
my
own
land'

we
can
if
we
are
making
for
minas
tirith'
said
aragorn
but
that
is
not
yet
agreed
and
such
a
course
may
be
more
perilous
than
it
sounds
the
vale
of
entwash
is
flat
and
fenny
and
fog
is
a
deadly
peril
there
for
those
on
foot
and
laden
I
would
not
abandon
our
boats
until
we
must
the
river
is
at
least
a
path
that
cannot
be
missed'

but
the
enemy
holds
the
eastern
bank'
objected
boromir
and
even
if
you
pass
the
gates
of
argonath
and
come
unmolested
to
the
tindrock
what
will
you
do
then
leap
down
the
falls
and
land
in
the
marshes
'

no
'
answered
aragorn
say
rather
that
we
will
bear
our
boats
by
the
ancient
way
to
raurosfoot
and
there
take
to
the
water
again
do
you
not
know
boromir
or
do
you
choose
to
forget
the
north
stair
and
the
high
seat
upon
amon
hen
that
were
made
in
the
days
of
the
great
kings
I
at
least
have
a
mind
to
stand
in
that
high
place
again
before
I
decide
my
further
course
there
maybe
we
shall
see
some
sign
that
will
guide
us'

boromir
held
out
long
against
this
choice
but
when
it
became
plain
that
frodo
would
follow
aragorn
wherever
he
went
he
gave
in
'it
is
not
the
way
of
the
men
of
minas
tirith
to
desert
their
friends
at
need'
he
said
and
you
will
need
my
strength
if
ever
you
are
to
reach
the
tindrock
to
the
tall
isle
I
will
go
but
no
further
there
I
shall
turn
to
my
home
alone
if
my
help
has
not
earned
the
reward
of
any
companionship'

the
day
was
now
growing
and
the
fog
had
lifted
a
little
it
was
decided
that
aragorn
and
legolas
should
at
once
go
forward
along
the
shore
while
the
others
remained
by
the
boats
aragorn
hoped
to
find
some
way
by
which
they
could
carry
both
their
boats
and
their
baggage
to
the
smoother
water
beyond
the
rapids

boats
of
the
elves
would
not
sink
maybe'
he
said
but
that
does
not
say
that
we
should
come
through
sarn
gebir
alive
none
have
ever
done
so
yet
no
road
was
made
by
the
men
of
gondor
in
this
region
for
even
in
their
great
days
their
realm
did
not
reach
up
anduin
beyond
the
emyn
muil
but
there
is
a
portageway
somewhere
on
the
western
shore
if
I
can
find
it
it
cannot
yet
have
perished
for
light
boats
used
to
journey
out
of
wilderland
down
to
osgiliath
and
still
did
so
until
a
few
years
ago
when
the
orcs
of
mordor
began
to
multiply'

'seldom
in
my
life
has
any
boat
come
out
of
the
north
and
the
orcs
prowl
on
the
eastshore'
said
boromir
if
you
go
forward
peril
will
grow
with
every
mile
even
if
you
find
a
path'

peril
lies
ahead
on
every
southward
road'
answered
aragorn
wait
for
us
one
day
if
we
do
not
return
in
that
time
you
will
know
that
evil
has
indeed
befallen
us
then
you
must
take
a
new
leader
and
follow
him
as
best
you
can'

it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
frodo
saw
aragorn
and
legolas
climb
the
steep
bank
and
vanish
into
the
mists
but
his
fears
proved
groundless
only
two
or
three
hours
had
passed
and
it
was
barely
midday
when
the
shadowy
shapes
of
the
explorers
appeared
again

all
is
well'
said
aragorn
as
he
clambered
down
the
bank
'there
is
a
track
and
it
leads
to
a
good
landing
that
is
still
serviceable
the
distance
is
not
great
the
head
of
the
rapids
is
but
half
a
mile
below
us
and
they
are
little
more
than
a
mile
long
not
far
beyond
them
the
stream
becomes
clear
and
smooth
again
though
it
runs
swiftly
our
hardest
task
will
be
to
get
our
boats
and
baggage
to
the
old
portageway
we
have
found
it
but
it
lies
well
back
from
the
waterside
here
and
runs
under
the
lee
of
a
rockwall
a
furlong
or
more
from
the
shore
we
did
not
find
where
the
northward
landing
lies
if
it
still
remains
we
must
have
passed
it
yesterday
night
we
might
labour
far
upstream
and
yet
miss
it
in
the
fog
I
fear
we
must
leave
the
river
now
and
make
for
the
portageway
as
best
we
can
from
here'

that
would
not
be
easy
even
if
we
were
all
men'
said
boromir

yet
such
as
we
are
we
will
try
it'
said
aragorn

'aye
we
will'
said
gimli
the
legs
of
men
will
lag
on
a
rough
road
while
a
dwarf
goes
on
be
the
burden
twice
his
own
weight
master
boromir
'

the
task
proved
hard
indeed
yet
in
the
end
it
was
done
the
goods
were
taken
out
of
the
boats
and
brought
to
the
top
of
the
bank
where
there
was
a
level
space
then
the
boats
were
drawn
out
of
the
water
and
carried
up
they
were
far
less
heavy
than
any
had
expected
of
what
tree
growing
in
the
elvish
country
they
were
made
not
even
legolas
knew
but
the
wood
was
tough
and
yet
strangely
light
merry
and
pippin
alone
could
carry
their
boat
with
ease
along
the
flat
nonetheless
it
needed
the
strength
of
the
two
men
to
lift
and
haul
them
over
the
ground
that
the
company
now
had
to
cross
it
sloped
up
away
from
the
river
a
tumbled
waste
of
grey
limestoneboulders
with
many
hidden
holes
shrouded
with
weeds
and
bushes
there
were
thickets
of
brambles
and
sheer
dells
and
here
and
there
boggy
pools
fed
by
waters
trickling
from
the
terraces
further
inland

one
by
one
boromir
and
aragorn
carried
the
boats
while
the
others
toiled
and
scrambled
after
them
with
the
baggage
at
last
all
was
removed
and
laid
on
the
portageway
then
with
little
further
hindrance
save
from
sprawling
briars
and
many
fallen
stones
they
moved
forward
all
together
fog
still
hung
in
veils
upon
the
crumbling
rockwall
and
to
their
left
mist
shrouded
the
river
they
could
hear
it
rushing
and
foaming
over
the
sharp
shelves
and
stony
teeth
of
sarn
gebir
but
they
could
not
see
it
twice
they
made
the
journey
before
all
was
brought
safe
to
the
southern
landing

there
the
portageway
turning
back
to
the
waterside
ran
gently
down
to
the
shallow
edge
of
a
little
pool
it
seemed
to
have
been
scooped
in
the
riverside
not
by
hand
but
by
the
water
swirling
down
from
sarn
gebir
against
a
low
pier
of
rock
that
jutted
out
some
way
into
the
stream
beyond
it
the
shore
rose
sheer
into
a
grey
cliff
and
there
was
no
further
passage
for
those
on
foot

already
the
short
afternoon
was
past
and
a
dim
cloudy
dusk
was
closing
in
they
sat
beside
the
water
listening
to
the
confused
rush
and
roar
of
the
rapids
hidden
in
the
mist
they
were
tired
and
sleepy
and
their
hearts
were
as
gloomy
as
the
dying
day

'well
here
we
are
and
here
we
must
pass
another
night'
said
boromir
we
need
sleep
and
even
if
aragorn
had
a
mind
to
pass
the
gates
of
argonath
by
night
we
are
all
too
tiredexcept
no
doubt
our
sturdy
dwarf'

gimli
made
no
reply
he
was
nodding
as
he
sat

let
us
rest
as
much
as
we
can
now'
said
aragorn
tomorrow
we
must
journey
by
day
again
unless
the
weather
changes
once
more
and
cheats
us
we
shall
have
a
good
chance
of
slipping
through
unseen
by
any
eyes
on
the
eastern
shore
but
tonight
two
must
watch
together
in
turns
three
hours
off
and
one
on
guard'

nothing
happened
that
night
worse
than
a
brief
drizzle
of
rain
an
hour
before
dawn
as
soon
as
it
was
fully
light
they
started
already
the
fog
was
thinning
they
kept
as
close
as
they
could
to
the
western
side
and
they
could
see
the
dim
shapes
of
the
low
cliffs
rising
ever
higher
shadowy
walls
with
their
feet
in
the
hurrying
river
in
the
midmorning
the
clouds
drew
down
lower
and
it
began
to
rain
heavily
they
drew
the
skincovers
over
their
boats
to
prevent
them
from
being
flooded
and
drifted
on
little
could
be
seen
before
them
or
about
them
through
the
grey
falling
curtains

the
rain
however
did
not
last
long
slowly
the
sky
above
grew
lighter
and
then
suddenly
the
clouds
broke
and
their
draggled
fringes
trailed
away
northward
up
the
river
the
fogs
and
mists
were
gone
before
the
travellers
lay
a
wide
ravine
with
great
rocky
sides
to
which
clung
upon
shelves
and
in
narrow
crevices
a
few
thrawn
trees
the
channel
grew
narrower
and
the
river
swifter
now
they
were
speeding
along
with
little
hope
of
stopping
or
turning
whatever
they
might
meet
ahead
over
them
was
a
lane
of
paleblue
sky
around
them
the
dark
overshadowed
river
and
before
them
black
shutting
out
the
sun
the
hills
of
emyn
muil
in
which
no
opening
could
be
seen

frodo
peering
forward
saw
in
the
distance
two
great
rocks
approaching
like
great
pinnacles
or
pillars
of
stone
they
seemed
tall
and
sheer
and
ominous
they
stood
upon
either
side
of
the
stream
a
narrow
gap
appeared
between
them
and
the
river
swept
the
boats
towards
it

behold
the
argonath
the
pillars
of
the
kings
'
cried
aragorn
we
shall
pass
them
soon
keep
the
boats
in
line
and
as
far
apart
as
you
can
hold
the
middle
of
the
stream
'

as
frodo
was
borne
towards
them
the
great
pillars
rose
like
towers
to
meet
him
giants
they
seemed
to
him
vast
grey
figures
silent
but
threatening
then
he
saw
that
they
were
indeed
shaped
and
fashioned
the
craft
and
power
of
old
had
wrought
upon
them
and
still
they
preserved
through
the
suns
and
rains
of
forgotten
years
the
mighty
likenesses
in
which
they
had
been
hewn
upon
great
pedestals
founded
in
the
deep
waters
stood
two
great
kings
of
stone
still
with
blurred
eyes
and
crannied
brows
they
frowned
upon
the
north
the
left
hand
of
each
was
raised
palm
outwards
in
gesture
of
warning
in
each
right
hand
there
was
an
axe
upon
each
head
there
was
a
crumbling
helm
and
crown
great
power
and
majesty
they
still
wore
the
silent
wardens
of
a
longvanished
kingdom
awe
and
fear
fell
upon
frodo
and
he
cowered
down
shutting
his
eyes
and
not
daring
to
look
up
as
the
boat
drew
near
even
boromir
bowed
his
head
as
the
boats
whirled
by
frail
and
fleeting
as
little
leaves
under
the
enduring
shadow
of
the
sentinels
of
nmenor
so
they
passed
into
the
dark
chasm
of
the
gates

sheer
rose
the
dreadful
cliffs
to
unguessed
heights
on
either
side
far
off
was
the
dim
sky
the
black
waters
roared
and
echoed
and
a
wind
screamed
over
them
frodo
crouching
over
his
knees
heard
sam
in
front
muttering
and
groaning
what
a
place
what
a
horrible
place
just
let
me
get
out
of
this
boat
and
i'll
never
wet
my
toes
in
a
puddle
again
let
alone
a
river
'

fear
not
'
said
a
strange
voice
behind
him
frodo
turned
and
saw
strider
and
yet
not
strider
for
the
weatherworn
ranger
was
no
longer
there
in
the
stern
sat
aragorn
son
of
arathorn
proud
and
erect
guiding
the
boat
with
skilful
strokes
his
hood
was
cast
back
and
his
dark
hair
was
blowing
in
the
wind
a
light
was
in
his
eyes
a
king
returning
from
exile
to
his
own
land

'fear
not
'
he
said
long
have
I
desired
to
look
upon
the
likenesses
of
isildur
and
anrion
my
sires
of
old
under
their
shadow
elessar
the
elfstone
son
of
arathorn
of
the
house
of
valandil

son
heir
of
elendil
has
nought
to
dread
'

then
the
light
of
his
eyes
faded
and
he
spoke
to
himself
would
that
gandalf
were
here
how
my
heart
yearns
for
minas
anor
and
the
walls
of
my
own
city
but
whither
now
shall
I
go
'

the
chasm
was
long
and
dark
and
filled
with
the
noise
of
wind
and
rushing
water
and
echoing
stone
it
bent
somewhat
towards
the
west
so
that
at
first
all
was
dark
ahead
but
soon
frodo
saw
a
tall
gap
of
light
before
him
ever
growing
swiftly
it
drew
near
and
suddenly
the
boats
shot
through
out
into
a
wide
clear
light

the
sun
already
long
fallen
from
the
noon
was
shining
in
a
windy
sky
the
pent
waters
spread
out
into
a
long
oval
lake
pale
nen
hithoel
fenced
by
steep
grey
hills
whose
sides
were
clad
with
trees
but
their
heads
were
bare
coldgleaming
in
the
sunlight
at
the
far
southern
end
rose
three
peaks
the
midmost
stood
somewhat
forward
from
the
others
and
sundered
from
them
an
island
in
the
waters
about
which
the
flowing
river
flung
pale
shimmering
arms
distant
but
deep
there
came
up
on
the
wind
a
roaring
sound
like
the
roll
of
thunder
heard
far
away

behold
tol
brandir
'
said
aragorn
pointing
south
to
the
tall
peak
'upon
the
left
stands
amon
lhaw
and
upon
the
right
is
amon
hen
the
hills
of
hearing
and
of
sight
in
the
days
of
the
great
kings
there
were
high
seats
upon
them
and
watch
was
kept
there
but
it
is
said
that
no
foot
of
man
or
beast
has
ever
been
set
upon
tol
brandir
ere
the
shade
of
night
falls
we
shall
come
to
them
I
hear
the
endless
voice
of
rauros
calling'

the
company
rested
now
for
a
while
drifting
south
on
the
current
that
flowed
through
the
middle
of
the
lake
they
ate
some
food
and
then
they
took
to
their
paddles
and
hastened
on
their
way
the
sides
of
the
westward
hills
fell
into
shadow
and
the
sun
grew
round
and
red
here
and
there
a
misty
star
peered
out
the
three
peaks
loomed
before
them
darkling
in
the
twilight
rauros
was
roaring
with
a
great
voice
already
night
was
laid
on
the
flowing
waters
when
the
travellers
came
at
last
under
the
shadow
of
the
hills

the
tenth
day
of
their
journey
was
over
wilderland
was
behind
them
they
could
go
no
further
without
choice
between
the
eastway
and
the
west
the
last
stage
of
the
quest
was
before
them


chapter
10


the
breaking
of
the
fellowship


aragorn
led
them
to
the
right
arm
of
the
river
here
upon
its
western
side
under
the
shadow
of
tol
brandir
a
green
lawn
ran
down
to
the
water
from
the
feet
of
amon
hen
behind
it
rose
the
first
gentle
slopes
of
the
hill
clad
with
trees
and
trees
marched
away
westward
along
the
curving
shores
of
the
lake
a
little
spring
fell
tumbling
down
and
fed
the
grass

'here
we
will
rest
tonight'
said
aragorn
this
is
the
lawn
of
parth
galen
a
fair
place
in
the
summer
days
of
old
let
us
hope
that
no
evil
has
yet
come
here'

they
drew
up
their
boats
on
the
green
banks
and
beside
them
they
made
their
camp
they
set
a
watch
but
had
no
sight
nor
sound
of
their
enemies
if
gollum
had
contrived
to
follow
them
he
remained
unseen
and
unheard
nonetheless
as
the
night
wore
on
aragorn
grew
uneasy
tossing
often
in
his
sleep
and
waking
in
the
small
hours
he
got
up
and
came
to
frodo
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch

why
are
you
waking
'
asked
frodo
it
is
not
your
watch'

I
do
not
know'
answered
aragorn
but
a
shadow
and
a
threat
has
been
growing
in
my
sleep
it
would
be
well
to
draw
your
sword'

why
'
said
frodo
are
enemies
at
hand
'

let
us
see
what
sting
may
show'
answered
aragorn

frodo
then
drew
the
elfblade
from
its
sheath
to
his
dismay
the
edges
gleamed
dimly
in
the
night
orcs
'
he
said
not
very
near
and
yet
too
near
it
seems'

I
feared
as
much'
said
aragorn
but
maybe
they
are
not
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
light
of
sting
is
faint
and
it
may
point
to
no
more
than
spies
of
mordor
roaming
on
the
slopes
of
amon
lhaw
I
have
never
heard
before
of
orcs
upon
amon
hen
yet
who
knows
what
may
happen
in
these
evil
days
now
that
minas
tirith
no
longer
holds
secure
the
passages
of
anduin
we
must
go
warily
tomorrow'

the
day
came
like
fire
and
smoke
low
in
the
east
there
were
black
bars
of
cloud
like
the
fumes
of
a
great
burning
the
rising
sun
lit
them
from
beneath
with
flames
of
murky
red
but
soon
it
climbed
above
them
into
a
clear
sky
the
summit
of
tol
brandir
was
tipped
with
gold
frodo
looked
out
eastward
and
gazed
at
the
tall
island
its
sides
sprang
sheer
out
of
the
running
water
high
up
above
the
tall
cliffs
were
steep
slopes
upon
which
trees
climbed
mounting
one
head
above
another
and
above
them
again
were
grey
faces
of
inaccessible
rock
crowned
by
a
great
spire
of
stone
many
birds
were
circling
about
it
but
no
sign
of
other
living
things
could
be
seen

when
they
had
eaten
aragorn
called
the
company
together
the
day
has
come
at
last'
he
said
'the
day
of
choice
which
we
have
long
delayed
what
shall
now
become
of
our
company
that
has
travelled
so
far
in
fellowship
shall
we
turn
west
with
boromir
and
go
to
the
wars
of
gondor
or
turn
east
to
the
fear
and
shadow
or
shall
we
break
our
fellowship
and
go
this
way
and
that
as
each
may
choose
whatever
we
do
must
be
done
soon
we
cannot
long
halt
here
the
enemy
is
on
the
eastern
shore
we
know
but
I
fear
that
the
orcs
may
already
be
on
this
side
of
the
water'

there
was
a
long
silence
in
which
no
one
spoke
or
moved

'well
frodo'
said
aragorn
at
last
I
fear
that
the
burden
is
laid
upon
you
you
are
the
bearer
appointed
by
the
council
your
own
way
you
alone
can
choose
in
this
matter
I
cannot
advise
you
I
am
not
gandalf
and
though
I
have
tried
to
bear
his
part
I
do
not
know
what
design
or
hope
he
had
for
this
hour
if
indeed
he
had
any
most
likely
it
seems
that
if
he
were
here
now
the
choice
would
still
wait
on
you
such
is
your
fate'

frodo
did
not
answer
at
once
then
he
spoke
slowly
I
know
that
haste
is
needed
yet
I
cannot
choose
the
burden
is
heavy
give
me
an
hour
longer
and
I
will
speak
let
me
be
alone
'

aragorn
looked
at
him
with
kindly
pity
very
well
frodo
son
of
drogo'
he
said
you
shall
have
an
hour
and
you
shall
be
alone
we
will
stay
here
for
a
while
but
do
not
stray
far
or
out
of
call'

frodo
sat
for
a
moment
with
his
head
bowed
sam
who
had
been
watching
his
master
with
great
concern
shook
his
head
and
muttered
'plain
as
a
pikestaff
it
is
but
it's
no
good
sam
gamgee
putting
in
his
spoke
just
now'


presently
frodo
got
up
and
walked
away
and
sam
saw
that
while
the
others
restrained
themselves
and
did
not
stare
at
him
the
eyes
of
boromir
followed
frodo
intently
until
he
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
trees
at
the
foot
of
amon
hen

wandering
aimlessly
at
first
in
the
wood
frodo
found
that
his
feet
were
leading
him
up
towards
the
slopes
of
the
hill
he
came
to
a
path
the
dwindling
ruins
of
a
road
of
long
ago
in
steep
places
stairs
of
stone
had
been
hewn
but
now
they
were
cracked
and
worn
and
split
by
the
roots
of
trees
for
some
while
he
climbed
not
caring
which
way
he
went
until
he
came
to
a
grassy
place
rowantrees
grew
about
it
and
in
the
midst
was
a
wide
flat
stone
the
little
upland
lawn
was
open
upon
the
east
and
was
filled
now
with
the
early
sunlight
frodo
halted
and
looked
out
over
the
river
far
below
him
to
tol
brandir
and
the
birds
wheeling
in
the
great
gulf
of
air
between
him
and
the
untrodden
isle
the
voice
of
rauros
was
a
mighty
roaring
mingled
with
a
deep
throbbing
boom

he
sat
down
upon
the
stone
and
cupped
his
chin
in
his
hands
staring
eastwards
but
seeing
little
with
his
eyes
all
that
had
happened
since
bilbo
left
the
shire
was
passing
through
his
mind
and
he
recalled
and
pondered
everything
that
he
could
remember
of
gandalf's
words
time
went
on
and
still
he
was
no
nearer
to
a
choice

suddenly
he
awoke
from
his
thoughts
a
strange
feeling
came
to
him
that
something
was
behind
him
that
unfriendly
eyes
were
upon
him
he
sprang
up
and
turned
but
all
that
he
saw
to
his
surprise
was
boromir
and
his
face
was
smiling
and
kind

I
was
afraid
for
you
frodo'
he
said
coming
forward
if
aragorn
is
right
and
orcs
are
near
then
none
of
us
should
wander
alone
and
you
least
of
all
so
much
depends
on
you
and
my
heart
too
is
heavy
may
I
stay
now
and
talk
for
a
while
since
I
have
found
you
it
would
comfort
me
where
there
are
so
many
all
speech
becomes
a
debate
without
end
but
two
together
may
perhaps
find
wisdom'

you
are
kind'
answered
frodo
'but
I
do
not
think
that
any
speech
will
help
me
for
I
know
what
I
should
do
but
I
am
afraid
of
doing
it
boromir
afraid'

boromir
stood
silent
rauros
roared
endlessly
on
the
wind
murmured
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
frodo
shivered

suddenly
boromir
came
and
sat
beside
him
are
you
sure
that
you
do
not
suffer
needlessly
'
he
said
I
wish
to
help
you
you
need
counsel
in
your
hard
choice
will
you
not
take
mine
'

'i
think
I
know
already
what
counsel
you
would
give
boromir'
said
frodo
'and
it
would
seem
like
wisdom
but
for
the
warning
of
my
heart'

warning
warning
against
what
'
said
boromir
sharply

'against
delay
against
the
way
that
seems
easier
against
refusal
of
the
burden
that
is
laid
on
me
againstwell
if
it
must
be
said
against
trust
in
the
strength
and
truth
of
men'

yet
that
strength
has
long
protected
you
far
away
in
your
little
country
though
you
knew
it
not'

'i
do
not
doubt
the
valour
of
your
people
but
the
world
is
changing
the
walls
of
minas
tirith
may
be
strong
but
they
are
not
strong
enough
if
they
fail
what
then
'

'we
shall
fall
in
battle
valiantly
yet
there
is
still
hope
that
they
will
not
fail'

'no
hope
while
the
ring
lasts'
said
frodo


'ah
the
ring
'
said
boromir
his
eyes
lighting
'the
ring
is
it
not
a
strange
fate
that
we
should
suffer
so
much
fear
and
doubt
for
so
small
a
thing
so
small
a
thing
and
I
have
seen
it
only
for
an
instant
in
the
house
of
elrond
could
I
not
have
a
sight
of
it
again
'

frodo
looked
up
his
heart
went
suddenly
cold
he
caught
the
strange
gleam
in
boromir's
eyes
yet
his
face
was
still
kind
and
friendly
'it
is
best
that
it
should
lie
hidden'
he
answered

'as
you
wish
I
care
not'
said
boromir
'yet
may
I
not
even
speak
of
it
for
you
seem
ever
to
think
only
of
its
power
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
of
its
evil
uses
not
of
its
good
the
world
is
changing
you
say
minas
tirith
will
fall
if
the
ring
lasts
but
why
certainly
if
the
ring
were
with
the
enemy
but
why
if
it
were
with
us
'

'were
you
not
at
the
council
'
answered
frodo
because
we
cannot
use
it
and
what
is
done
with
it
turns
to
evil'

boromir
got
up
and
walked
about
impatiently
'so
you
go
on'
he
cried
'gandalf
elrond

all
these
folk
have
taught
you
to
say
so
for
themselves
they
may
be
right
these
elves
and
halfelves
and
wizards
they
would
come
to
grief
perhaps
yet
often
I
doubt
if
they
are
wise
and
not
merely
timid
but
each
to
his
own
kind
truehearted
men
they
will
not
be
corrupted
we
of
minas
tirith
have
been
staunch
through
long
years
of
trial
we
do
not
desire
the
power
of
wizardlords
only
strength
to
defend
ourselves
strength
in
a
just
cause
and
behold
in
our
need
chance
brings
to
light
the
ring
of
power
it
is
a
gift
I
say
a
gift
to
the
foes
of
mordor
it
is
mad
not
to
use
it
to
use
the
power
of
the
enemy
against
him
the
fearless
the
ruthless
these
alone
will
achieve
victory
what
could
not
a
warrior
do
in
this
hour
a
great
leader
what
could
not
aragorn
do
or
if
he
refuses
why
not
boromir
the
ring
would
give
me
power
of
command
how
I
would
drive
the
hosts
of
mordor
and
all
men
would
flock
to
my
banner'

boromir
strode
up
and
down
speaking
ever
more
loudly
almost
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
frodo
while
his
talk
dwelt
on
walls
and
weapons
and
the
mustering
of
men
and
he
drew
plans
for
great
alliances
and
glorious
victories
to
be
and
he
cast
down
mordor
and
became
himself
a
mighty
king
benevolent
and
wise
suddenly
he
stopped
and
waved
his
arms

'and
they
tell
us
to
throw
it
away'
he
cried
I
do
not
say

destroy

it
that
might
be
well
if
reason
could
show
any
hope
of
doing
so
it
does
not
the
only
plan
that
is
proposed
to
us
is
that
a
halfling
should
walk
blindly
into
mordor
and
offer
the
enemy
every
chance
of
recapturing
it
for
himself
folly

'surely
you
see
it
my
friend'
he
said
turning
now
suddenly
to
frodo
again
you
say
that
you
are
afraid
if
it
is
so
the
boldest
should
pardon
you
but
is
it
not
really
your
good
sense
that
revolts'

'no
I
am
afraid'
said
frodo
'simply
afraid
but
I
am
glad
to
have
heard
you
speak
so
fully
my
mind
is
clearer
now'

then
you
will
come
to
minas
tirith
'
cried
boromir
his
eyes
were
shining
and
his
face
eager

you
misunderstand
me'
said
frodo

'but
you
will
come
at
least
for
a
while
'
boromir
persisted
'my
city
is
not
far
now
and
it
is
little
further
from
there
to
mordor
than
from
here
we
have
been
long
in
the
wilderness
and
you
need
news
of
what
the
enemy
is
doing
before
you
make
a
move
come
with
me
frodo'
he
said
you
need
rest
before
your
venture
if
go
you
must'
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
hobbit's
shoulder
in
friendly
fashion
but
frodo
felt
the
hand
trembling
with
suppressed
excitement
he
stepped
quickly
away
and
eyed
with
alarm
the
tall
man
nearly
twice
his
height
and
many
times
his
match
in
strength

why
are
you
so
unfriendly
'
said
boromir
I
am
a
true
man
neither
thief
nor
tracker
I
need
your
ring
that
you
know
now
but
I
give
you
my
word
that
I
do
not
desire
to
keep
it
will
you
not
at
least
let
me
make
trial
of
my
plan
lend
me
the
ring
'

no
no
'
cried
frodo
'the
council
laid
it
upon
me
to
bear
it'

it
is
by
our
own
folly
that
the
enemy
will
defeat
us'
cried
boromir
how
it
angers
me
fool
obstinate
fool
running
wilfully
to
death
and
ruining
our
cause
if
any
mortals
have
claim
to
the
ring
it
is
the
men
of
nmenor
and
not
halflings
it
is
not
yours
save
by
unhappy
chance
it
might
have
been
mine
it
should
be
mine
give
it
to
me
'

frodo
did
not
answer
but
moved
away
till
the
great
flat
stone
stood
between
them
come
come
my
friend
'
said
boromir
in
a
softer
voice
'why
not
get
rid
of
it
why
not
be
free
of
your
doubt
and
fear
you
can
lay
the
blame
on
me
if
you
will
you
can
say
that
I
was
too
strong
and
took
it
by
force
for
I
am
too
strong
for
you
halfling'
he
cried
and
suddenly
he
sprang
over
the
stone
and
leaped
at
frodo
his
fair
and
pleasant
face
was
hideously
changed
a
raging
fire
was
in
his
eyes

frodo
dodged
aside
and
again
put
the
stone
between
them
there
was
only
one
thing
he
could
do
trembling
he
pulled
out
the
ring
upon
its
chain
and
quickly
slipped
it
on
his
finger
even
as
boromir
sprang
at
him
again
the
man
gasped
stared
for
a
moment
amazed
and
then
ran
wildly
about
seeking
here
and
there
among
the
rocks
and
trees

'miserable
trickster'
he
shouted
let
me
get
my
hands
on
you
now
I
see
your
mind
you
will
take
the
ring
to
sauron
and
sell
us
all
you
have
only
waited
your
chance
to
leave
us
in
the
lurch
curse
you
and
all
halflings
to
death
and
darkness
'
then
catching
his
foot
on
a
stone
he
fell
sprawling
and
lay
upon
his
face
for
a
while
he
was
as
still
as
if
his
own
curse
had
struck
him
down
then
suddenly
he
wept

he
rose
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
dashing
away
the
tears
'what
have
I
said
'
he
cried
what
have
I
done
frodo
frodo
'
he
called
'come
back
a
madness
took
me
but
it
has
passed
come
back
'

there
was
no
answer
frodo
did
not
even
hear
his
cries
he
was
already
far
away
leaping
blindly
up
the
path
to
the
hilltop
terror
and
grief
shook
him
seeing
in
his
thought
the
mad
fierce
face
of
boromir
and
his
burning
eyes

soon
he
came
out
alone
on
the
summit
of
amon
hen
and
halted
gasping
for
breath
he
saw
as
through
a
mist
a
wide
flat
circle
paved
with
mighty
flags
and
surrounded
with
a
crumbling
battlement
and
in
the
middle
set
upon
four
carven
pillars
was
a
high
seat
reached
by
a
stair
of
many
steps
up
he
went
and
sat
upon
the
ancient
chair
feeling
like
a
lost
child
that
had
clambered
upon
the
throne
of
mountainkings

at
first
he
could
see
little
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
world
of
mist
in
which
there
were
only
shadows
the
ring
was
upon
him
then
here
and
there
the
mist
gave
way
and
he
saw
many
visions
small
and
clear
as
if
they
were
under
his
eyes
upon
a
table
and
yet
remote
there
was
no
sound
only
bright
living
images
the
world
seemed
to
have
shrunk
and
fallen
silent
he
was
sitting
upon
the
seat
of
seeing
on
amon
hen
the
hill
of
the
eye
of
the
men
of
nmenor
eastward
he
looked
into
wide
uncharted
lands
nameless
plains
and
forests
unexplored
northward
he
looked
and
the
great
river
lay
like
a
ribbon
beneath
him
and
the
misty
mountains
stood
small
and
hard
as
broken
teeth
westward
he
looked
and
saw
the
broad
pastures
of
rohan
and
orthanc
the
pinnacle
of
isengard
like
a
black
spike
southward
he
looked
and
below
his
very
feet
the
great
river
curled
like
a
toppling
wave
and
plunged
over
the
falls
of
rauros
into
a
foaming
pit
a
glimmering
rainbow
played
upon
the
fume
and
ethir
anduin
he
saw
the
mighty
delta
of
the
river
and
myriads
of
seabirds
whirling
like
a
white
dust
in
the
sun
and
beneath
them
a
green
and
silver
sea
rippling
in
endless
lines

but
everywhere
he
looked
he
saw
the
signs
of
war
the
misty
mountains
were
crawling
like
anthills
orcs
were
issuing
out
of
a
thousand
holes
under
the
boughs
of
mirkwood
there
was
deadly
strife
of
elves
and
men
and
fell
beasts
the
land
of
the
beornings
was
aflame
a
cloud
was
over
moria
smoke
rose
on
the
borders
of
lrien

horsemen
were
galloping
on
the
grass
of
rohan
wolves
poured
from
isengard
from
the
havens
of
harad
ships
of
war
put
out
to
sea
and
out
of
the
east
men
were
moving
endlessly
swordsmen
spearmen
bowmen
upon
horses
chariots
of
chieftains
and
laden
wains
all
the
power
of
the
dark
lord
was
in
motion
then
turning
south
again
he
beheld
minas
tirith
far
away
it
seemed
and
beautiful
whitewalled
manytowered
proud
and
fair
upon
its
mountainseat
its
battlements
glittered
with
steel
and
its
turrets
were
bright
with
many
banners
hope
leaped
in
his
heart
but
against
minas
tirith
was
set
another
fortress
greater
and
more
strong
thither
eastward
unwilling
his
eye
was
drawn
it
passed
the
ruined
bridges
of
osgiliath
the
grinning
gates
of
minas
morgul
and
the
haunted
mountains
and
it
looked
upon
gorgoroth
the
valley
of
terror
in
the
land
of
mordor
darkness
lay
there
under
the
sun
fire
glowed
amid
the
smoke
mount
doom
was
burning
and
a
great
reek
rising
then
at
last
his
gaze
was
held
wall
upon
wall
battlement
upon
battlement
black
immeasurably
strong
mountain
of
iron
gate
of
steel
tower
of
adamant
he
saw
it
baraddr
fortress
of
sauron
all
hope
left
him

and
suddenly
he
felt
the
eye
there
was
an
eye
in
the
dark
tower
that
did
not
sleep
he
knew
that
it
had
become
aware
of
his
gaze
a
fierce
eager
will
was
there
it
leaped
towards
him
almost
like
a
finger
he
felt
it
searching
for
him
very
soon
it
would
nail
him
down
know
just
exactly
where
he
was
amon
lhaw
it
touched
it
glanced
upon
tol
brandir
he
threw
himself
from
the
seat
crouching
covering
his
head
with
his
grey
hood

he
heard
himself
crying
out

never
never
or
was
it

verily
I
come
I
come
to
you

he
could
not
tell
then
as
a
flash
from
some
other
point
of
power
there
came
to
his
mind
another
thought

take
it
off
take
it
off
fool
take
it
off
take
off
the
ring


the
two
powers
strove
in
him
for
a
moment
perfectly
balanced
between
their
piercing
points
he
writhed
tormented
suddenly
he
was
aware
of
himself
again
frodo
neither
the
voice
nor
the
eye
free
to
choose
and
with
one
remaining
instant
in
which
to
do
so
he
took
the
ring
off
his
finger
he
was
kneeling
in
clear
sunlight
before
the
high
seat
a
black
shadow
seemed
to
pass
like
an
arm
above
him
it
missed
amon
hen
and
groped
out
west
and
faded
then
all
the
sky
was
clean
and
blue
and
birds
sang
in
every
tree

frodo
rose
to
his
feet
a
great
weariness
was
on
him
but
his
will
was
firm
and
his
heart
lighter
he
spoke
aloud
to
himself
I
will
do
now
what
I
must'
he
said
'this
at
least
is
plain
the
evil
of
the
ring
is
already
at
work
even
in
the
company
and
the
ring
must
leave
them
before
it
does
more
harm
I
will
go
alone
some
I
cannot
trust
and
those
I
can
trust
are
too
dear
to
me
poor
old
sam
and
merry
and
pippin
strider
too
his
heart
yearns
for
minas
tirith
and
he
will
be
needed
there
now
boromir
has
fallen
into
evil
I
will
go
alone
at
once'

he
went
quickly
down
the
path
and
came
back
to
the
lawn
where
boromir
had
found
him
then
he
halted
listening
he
thought
he
could
hear
cries
and
calls
from
the
woods
near
the
shore
below

'they'll
be
hunting
for
me'
he
said
I
wonder
how
long
I
have
been
away
hours
I
should
think'
he
hesitated
'what
can
I
do
'
he
muttered
'i
must
go
now
or
I
shall
never
go
I
shan't
get
a
chance
again
I
hate
leaving
them
and
like
this
without
any
explanation
but
surely
they
will
understand
sam
will
and
what
else
can
I
do'

slowly
he
drew
out
the
ring
and
put
it
on
once
more
he
vanished
and
passed
down
the
hill
less
than
a
rustle
of
the
wind

the
others
remained
long
by
the
riverside
for
some
time
they
had
been
silent
moving
restlessly
about
but
now
they
were
sitting
in
a
circle
and
they
were
talking
every
now
and
again
they
made
efforts
to
speak
of
other
things
of
their
long
road
and
many
adventures
they
questioned
aragorn
concerning
the
realm
of
gondor
and
its
ancient
history
and
the
remnants
of
its
great
works
that
could
still
be
seen
in
this
strange
borderland
of
the
emyn
muil
the
stone
kings
and
the
seats
of
lhaw
and
hen
and
the
great
stair
beside
the
falls
of
rauros
but
always
their
thoughts
and
words
strayed
back
to
frodo
and
the
ring
what
would
frodo
choose
to
do
why
was
he
hesitating

he
is
debating
which
course
is
the
most
desperate
I
think'
said
aragorn
'and
well
he
may
it
is
now
more
hopeless
than
ever
for
the
company
to
go
east
since
we
have
been
tracked
by
gollum
and
must
fear
that
the
secret
of
our
journey
is
already
betrayed
but
minas
tirith
is
no
nearer
to
the
fire
and
the
destruction
of
the
burden

we
may
remain
there
for
a
while
and
make
a
brave
stand
but
the
lord
denethor
and
all
his
men
cannot
hope
to
do
what
even
elrond
said
was
beyond
his
power
either
to
keep
the
burden
secret
or
to
hold
off
the
full
might
of
the
enemy
when
he
comes
to
take
it
which
way
would
any
of
us
choose
in
frodo's
place
I
do
not
know
now
indeed
we
miss
gandalf
most'

'grievous
is
our
loss'
said
legolas
'yet
we
must
needs
make
up
our
minds
without
his
aid
why
cannot
we
decide
and
so
help
frodo
let
us
call
him
back
and
then
vote
I
should
vote
for
minas
tirith'

and
so
should
i'
said
gimli
'we
of
course
were
only
sent
to
help
the
bearer
along
the
road
to
go
no
further
than
we
wished
and
none
of
us
is
under
any
oath
or
command
to
seek
mount
doom
hard
was
my
parting
from
lothlrien
yet
I
have
come
so
far
and
I
say
this
now
we
have
reached
the
last
choice
it
is
clear
to
me
that
I
cannot
leave
frodo
I
would
choose
minas
tirith
but
if
he
does
not
then
I
follow
him'

and
I
too
will
go
with
him'
said
legolas
it
would
be
faithless
now
to
say
farewell'

'it
would
indeed
be
a
betrayal
if
we
all
left
him'
said
aragorn
'but
if
he
goes
east
then
all
need
not
go
with
him
nor
do
I
think
that
all
should
that
venture
is
desperate
as
much
so
for
eight
as
for
three
or
two
or
one
alone
if
you
would
let
me
choose
then
I
should
appoint
three
companions
sam
who
could
not
bear
it
otherwise
and
gimli
and
myself
boromir
will
return
to
his
own
city
where
his
father
and
his
people
need
him
and
with
him
the
others
should
go
or
at
least
meriadoc
and
peregrin
if
legolas
is
not
willing
to
leave
us'

that
won't
do
at
all
'
cried
merry
'we
can't
leave
frodo
pippin
and
I
always
intended
to
go
wherever
he
went
and
we
still
do
but
we
did
not
realize
what
that
would
mean
it
seemed
different
so
far
away
in
the
shire
or
in
rivendell
it
would
be
mad
and
cruel
to
let
frodo
go
to
mordor
why
can't
we
stop
him'

'we
must
stop
him'
said
pippin
and
that
is
what
he
is
worrying
about
I
am
sure
he
knows
we
shan't
agree
to
his
going
east
and
he
doesn't
like
to
ask
anyone
to
go
with
him
poor
old
fellow
imagine
it
going
off
to
mordor
alone
'
pippin
shuddered
'but
the
dear
silly
old
hobbit
he
ought
to
know
that
he
hasn't
got
to
ask
he
ought
to
know
that
if
we
can't
stop
him
we
shan't
leave
him'

'begging
your
pardon'
said
sam
'i
don't
think
you
understand
my
master
at
all
he
isn't
hesitating
about
which
way
to
go
of
course
not
what's
the
good
of
minas
tirith
anyway
to
him
I
mean
begging
your
pardon
master
boromir'
he
added
and
turned
it
was
then
that
they
discovered
that
boromir
who
at
first
had
been
sitting
silent
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
was
no
longer
there

now
where's
he
got
to
'
cried
sam
looking
worried
'he's
been
a
bit
queer
lately
to
my
mind
but
anyway
he's
not
in
this
business
he's
off
to
his
home
as
he
always
said
and
no
blame
to
him
but
mr
frodo
he
knows
he's
got
to
find
the
cracks
of
doom
if
he
can
but
he's

afraid

now
it's
come
to
the
point
he's
just
plain
terrified
that's
what
his
trouble
is
of
course
he's
had
a
bit
of
schooling
so
to
speakwe
all
havesince
we
left
home
or
he'd
be
so
terrified
he'd
just
fling
the
ring
in
the
river
and
bolt
but
he's
still
too
frightened
to
start
and
he
isn't
worrying
about
us
either
whether
we'll
go
along
with
him
or
no
he
knows
we
mean
to
that's
another
thing
that's
bothering
him
if
he
screws
himself
up
to
go
he'll
want
to
go
alone
mark
my
words
we're
going
to
have
trouble
when
he
comes
back
for
he'll
screw
himself
up
all
right
as
sure
as
his
name's
baggins'

'i
believe
you
speak
more
wisely
than
any
of
us
sam'
said
aragorn
and
what
shall
we
do
if
you
prove
right
'

'stop
him
don't
let
him
go
'
cried
pippin

'i
wonder
'
said
aragorn
he
is
the
bearer
and
the
fate
of
the
burden
is
on
him
I
do
not
think
that
it
is
our
part
to
drive
him
one
way
or
the
other
nor
do
I
think
that
we
should
succeed
if
we
tried
there
are
other
powers
at
work
far
stronger'

well
I
wish
frodo
would
screw
himself
up
and
come
back
and
let
us
get
it
over'
said
pippin
this
waiting
is
horrible
surely
the
time
is
up
'

yes'
said
aragorn
'the
hour
is
long
passed
the
morning
is
wearing
away
we
must
call
for
him'


at
that
moment
boromir
reappeared
he
came
out
from
the
trees
and
walked
towards
them
without
speaking
his
face
looked
grim
and
sad
he
paused
as
if
counting
those
that
were
present
and
then
sat
down
aloof
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground

where
have
you
been
boromir
'
asked
aragorn
have
you
seen
frodo
'

boromir
hesitated
for
a
second
yes
and
no'
he
answered
slowly
yes
I
found
him
some
way
up
the
hill
and
I
spoke
to
him
I
urged
him
to
come
to
minas
tirith
and
not
to
go
east
I
grew
angry
and
he
left
me
he
vanished
I
have
never
seen
such
a
thing
happen
before
though
I
have
heard
of
it
in
tales
he
must
have
put
the
ring
on
I
could
not
find
him
again
I
thought
he
would
return
to
you'

'is
that
all
that
you
have
to
say
'
said
aragorn
looking
hard
and
not
too
kindly
at
boromir

yes'
he
answered
I
will
say
no
more
yet'

this
is
bad'
cried
sam
jumping
up
I
don't
know
what
this
man
has
been
up
to
why
should
mr
frodo
put
the
thing
on
he
didn't
ought
to
have
and
if
he
has
goodness
knows
what
may
have
happened'

'but
he
wouldn't
keep
it
on'
said
merry
not
when
he
had
escaped
the
unwelcome
visitor
like
bilbo
used
to'

but
where
did
he
go
where
is
he
'
cried
pippin
'he's
been
away
ages
now'

how
long
is
it
since
you
saw
frodo
last
boromir
'
asked
aragorn

half
an
hour
maybe'
he
answered
or
it
might
be
an
hour
I
have
wandered
for
some
time
since
I
do
not
know
I
do
not
know
'
he
put
his
head
in
his
hands
and
sat
as
if
bowed
with
grief
an
hour
since
he
vanished
'
shouted
sam
we
must
try
and
find
him
at
once
come
on
'

wait
a
moment
'
cried
aragorn
we
must
divide
up
into
pairs
and
arrangehere
hold
on
wait
'

it
was
no
good
they
took
no
notice
of
him
sam
had
dashed
off
first
merry
and
pippin
had
followed
and
were
already
disappearing
westward
into
the
trees
by
the
shore
shouting

frodo
frodo

in
their
clear
high
hobbitvoices
legolas
and
gimli
were
running
a
sudden
panic
or
madness
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
the
company

we
shall
all
be
scattered
and
lost'
groaned
aragorn
boromir
I
do
not
know
what
part
you
have
played
in
this
mischief
but
help
now
go
after
those
two
young
hobbits
and
guard
them
at
the
least
even
if
you
cannot
find
frodo
come
back
to
this
spot
if
you
find
him
or
any
traces
of
him
I
shall
return
soon'

aragorn
sprang
swiftly
away
and
went
in
pursuit
of
sam
just
as
he
reached
the
little
lawn
among
the
rowans
he
overtook
him
toiling
uphill
panting
and
calling

frodo


come
with
me
sam
'
he
said
none
of
us
should
be
alone
there
is
mischief
about
I
feel
it
I
am
going
to
the
top
to
the
seat
of
amon
hen
to
see
what
may
be
seen
and
look
it
is
as
my
heart
guessed
frodo
went
this
way
follow
me
and
keep
your
eyes
open
'
he
sped
up
the
path

sam
did
his
best
but
he
could
not
keep
up
with
strider
the
ranger
and
soon
fell
behind
he
had
not
gone
far
before
aragorn
was
out
of
sight
ahead
sam
stopped
and
puffed
suddenly
he
clapped
his
hand
to
his
head

whoa
sam
gamgee
'
he
said
aloud
your
legs
are
too
short
so
use
your
head
let
me
see
now
boromir
isn't
lying
that's
not
his
way
but
he
hasn't
told
us
everything
something
scared
mr
frodo
badly
he
screwed
himself
up
to
the
point
sudden
he
made
up
his
mind
at
last
to
go
where
to
off
east
not
without
sam
yes
without
even
his
sam
that's
hard
cruel
hard'

sam
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
brushing
away
the
tears
'steady
gamgee
'
he
said
think
if
you
can
he
can't
fly
across
rivers
and
he
can't
jump
waterfalls
he's
got
no
gear
so
he's
got
to
get
back
to
the
boats
back
to
the
boats
back
to
the
boats
sam
like
lightning
'

sam
turned
and
bolted
back
down
the
path
he
fell
and
cut
his
knees
up
he
got
and
ran
on
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
lawn
of
parth
galen
by
the
shore
where
the
boats
were
drawn
up
out
of
the
water
no
one
was
there
there
seemed
to
be
cries
in
the
woods
behind
but
he
did
not
heed
them

he
stood
gazing
for
a
moment
stockstill
gaping
a
boat
was
sliding
down
the
bank
all
by
itself
with
a
shout
sam
raced
across
the
grass
the
boat
slipped
into
the
water

coming
mr
frodo
coming
'
called
sam
and
flung
himself
from
the
bank
clutching
at
the
departing
boat
he
missed
it
by
a
yard
with
a
cry
and
a
splash
he
fell
face
downward
into
deep
swift
water
gurgling
he
went
under
and
the
river
closed
over
his
curly
head

an
exclamation
of
dismay
came
from
the
empty
boat
a
paddle
swirled
and
the
boat
put
about
frodo
was
just
in
time
to
grasp
sam
by
the
hair
as
he
came
up
bubbling
and
struggling
fear
was
staring
in
his
round
brown
eyes

up
you
come
sam
my
lad
'
said
frodo
now
take
my
hand
'

save
me
mr
frodo
'
gasped
sam
i'm
drownded
I
can't
see
your
hand'

here
it
is
don't
pinch
lad
I
won't
let
you
go
tread
water
and
don't
flounder
or
you'll
upset
the
boat
there
now
get
hold
of
the
side
and
let
me
use
the
paddle
'

with
a
few
strokes
frodo
brought
the
boat
back
to
the
bank
and
sam
was
able
to
scramble
out
wet
as
a
waterrat
frodo
took
off
the
ring
and
stepped
ashore
again

of
all
the
confounded
nuisances
you
are
the
worst
sam
'
he
said

'oh
mr
frodo
that's
hard
'
said
sam
shivering
that's
hard
trying
to
go
without
me
and
all
if
I
hadn't
a
guessed
right
where
would
you
be
now
'

safely
on
my
way'

safely
'
said
sam
all
alone
and
without
me
to
help
you
I
couldn't
have
a
borne
it
it'd
have
been
the
death
of
me'

'it
would
be
the
death
of
you
to
come
with
me
sam'
said
frodo
and
I
could
not
have
borne
that'

not
as
certain
as
being
left
behind'
said
sam

but
I
am
going
to
mordor'

I
know
that
well
enough
mr
frodo
of
course
you
are
and
i'm
coming
with
you'

now
sam'
said
frodo
don't
hinder
me
the
others
will
be
coming
back
at
any
minute
if
they
catch
me
here
I
shall
have
to
argue
and
explain
and
I
shall
never
have
the
heart
or
the
chance
to
get
off
but
I
must
go
at
once
it's
the
only
way'

of
course
it
is'
answered
sam
'but
not
alone
i'm
coming
too
or
neither
of
us
isn't
going
i'll
knock
holes
in
all
the
boats
first'

frodo
actually
laughed
a
sudden
warmth
and
gladness
touched
his
heart
leave
one
'he
said
we'll
need
it
but
you
can't
come
like
this
without
your
gear
or
food
or
anything'

'just
hold
on
a
moment
and
i'll
get
my
stuff'
cried
sam
eagerly
'it's
all
ready
I
thought
we
should
be
off
today'
he
rushed
to
the
camping
place
fished
out
his
pack
from
the
pile
where
frodo
had
laid
it
when
he
emptied
the
boat
of
his
companions'
goods
grabbed
a
spare
blanket
and
some
extra
packages
of
food
and
ran
back

so
all
my
plan
is
spoilt
'
said
frodo
it
is
no
good
trying
to
escape
you
but
i'm
glad
sam
I
cannot
tell
you
how
glad
come
along
it
is
plain
that
we
were
meant
to
go
together
we
will
go
and
may
the
others
find
a
safe
road
strider
will
look
after
them
I
don't
suppose
we
shall
see
them
again'

yet
we
may
mr
frodo
we
may'
said
sam

so
frodo
and
sam
set
off
on
the
last
stage
of
the
quest
together
frodo
paddled
away
from
the
shore
and
the
river
bore
them
swiftly
away
down
the
western
arm
and
past
the
frowning
cliffs
of
tol
brandir
the
roar
of
the
great
falls
drew
nearer
even
with
such
help
as
sam
could
give
it
was
hard
work
to
pass
across
the
current
at
the
southward
end
of
the
island
and
drive
the
boat
eastward
towards
the
far
shore

at
length
they
came
to
land
again
upon
the
southern
slopes
of
amon
lhaw
there
they
found
a
shelving
shore
and
they
drew
the
boat
out
high
above
the
water
and
hid
it
as
well
as
they
could
behind
a
great
boulder
then
shouldering
their
burdens
they
set
off
seeking
a
path
that
would
bring
them
over
the
grey
hills
of
the
emyn
muil
and
down
into
the
land
of
shadow


here
ends
the
first
part
of
the
history
of
the
war
of
the
ring

the
second
part
is
called
the
two
towers
since
the
events
recounted
in
it
are
dominated
by
orthanc
the
citadel
of
saruman
and
the
fortress
of
minas
morgul
that
guards
the
secret
entrance
to
mordor
it
tells
of
the
deeds
and
perils
of
all
the
members
of
the
now
sundered
fellowship
until
the
coming
of
the
great
darkness

the
third
part
tells
of
the
last
defence
against
the
shadow
and
the
end
of
the
mission
of
the
ringbearer
in
the
return
of
the
king
