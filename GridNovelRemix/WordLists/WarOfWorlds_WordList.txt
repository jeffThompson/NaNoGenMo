who

are

of

war


no
one
would
have
believed
in
the
last
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
that
this
world
was
being
watched
keenly
and
closely
by
intelligences
greater
than
man's
and
yet
as
mortal
as
his
own
that
as
men
busied
themselves
about
their
various
concerns
they
were
scrutinised
and
studied
perhaps
almost
as
narrowly
as
a
man
with
a
microscope
might
scrutinise
the
transient
creatures
that
swarm
and
multiply
in
a
drop
of
water

with
infinite
complacency
men
went
to
and
fro
over
this
globe
about
their
little
affairs
serene
in
their
assurance
of
their
empire
over
matter

it
is
possible
that
the
infusoria
under
the
microscope
do
the
same

no
one
gave
a
thought
to
the
older
worlds
of
space
as
sources
of
human
danger
or
thought
of
them
only
to
dismiss
the
idea
of
life
upon
them
as
impossible
or
improbable

it
is
curious
to
recall
some
of
the
mental
habits
of
those
departed
days

at
most
terrestrial
men
fancied
there
might
be
other
men
upon
mars
perhaps
inferior
to
themselves
and
ready
to
welcome
a
missionary
enterprise

yet
across
the
gulf
of
space
minds
that
are
to
our
minds
as
ours
are
to
those
of
the
beasts
that
perish
intellects
vast
and
cool
and
unsympathetic
regarded
this
earth
with
envious
eyes
and
slowly
and
surely
drew
their
plans
against
us

and
early
in
the
twentieth
century
came
the
great
disillusionment

the
planet
mars
I
scarcely
need
remind
the
reader
revolves
about
the
sun
at
a
mean
distance
of
140000000
miles
and
the
light
and
heat
it
receives
from
the
sun
is
barely
half
of
that
received
by
this
world
it
must
be
if
the
nebular
hypothesis
has
any
truth
older
than
our
world
and
long
before
this
earth
ceased
to
be
molten
life
upon
its
surface
must
have
begun
its
course

the
fact
that
it
is
scarcely
one
seventh
of
the
volume
of
the
earth
must
have
accelerated
its
cooling
to
the
temperature
at
which
life
could
begin

it
has
air
and
water
and
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
support
of
animated
existence

yet
so
vain
is
man
and
so
blinded
by
his
vanity
that
no
writer
up
to
the
very
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
expressed
any
idea
that
intelligent
life
might
have
developed
there
far
or
indeed
at
all
beyond
its
earthly
level

nor
was
it
generally
understood
that
since
mars
is
older
than
our
earth
with
scarcely
a
quarter
of
the
superficial
area
and
remoter
from
the
sun
it
necessarily
follows
that
it
is
not
only
more
distant
from
time's
beginning
but
nearer
its
end

the
secular
cooling
that
must
someday
overtake
our
planet
has
already
gone
far
indeed
with
our
neighbour

its
physical
condition
is
still
largely
a
mystery
but
we
know
now
that
even
in
its
equatorial
region
the
midday
temperature
barely
approaches
that
of
our
coldest
winter

its
air
is
much
more
attenuated
than
ours
its
oceans
have
shrunk
until
they
cover
but
a
third
of
its
surface
and
as
its
slow
seasons
change
huge
snowcaps
gather
and
melt
about
either
pole
and
periodically
inundate
its
temperate
zones

that
last
stage
of
exhaustion
which
to
us
is
still
incredibly
remote
has
become
a
presentday
problem
for
the
inhabitants
of
mars

the
immediate
pressure
of
necessity
has
brightened
their
intellects
enlarged
their
powers
and
hardened
their
hearts

and
looking
across
space
with
instruments
and
intelligences
such
as
we
have
scarcely
dreamed
of
they
see
at
its
nearest
distance
only
35000000
of
miles
sunward
of
them
a
morning
star
of
hope
our
own
warmer
planet
green
with
vegetation
and
grey
with
water
with
a
cloudy
atmosphere
eloquent
of
fertility
with
glimpses
through
its
drifting
cloud
wisps
of
broad
stretches
of
populous
country
and
narrow
navycrowded
seas

and
we
men
the
creatures
who
inhabit
this
earth
must
be
to
them
at
least
as
alien
and
lowly
as
are
the
monkeys
and
lemurs
to
us

the
intellectual
side
of
man
already
admits
that
life
is
an
incessant
struggle
for
existence
and
it
would
seem
that
this
too
is
the
belief
of
the
minds
upon
mars

their
world
is
far
gone
in
its
cooling
and
this
world
is
still
crowded
with
life
but
crowded
only
with
what
they
regard
as
inferior
animals

to
carry
warfare
sunward
is
indeed
their
only
escape
from
the
destruction
that
generation
after
generation
creeps
upon
them

and
before
we
judge
of
them
too
harshly
we
must
remember
what
ruthless
and
utter
destruction
our
own
species
has
wrought
not
only
upon
animals
such
as
the
vanished
bison
and
the
dodo
but
upon
its
inferior
races

the
tasmanians
in
spite
of
their
human
likeness
were
entirely
swept
out
of
existence
in
a
war
of
extermination
waged
by
european
immigrants
in
the
space
of
fifty
years

are
we
such
apostles
of
mercy
as
to
complain
if
the
martians
warred
in
the
same
spirit

the
martians
seem
to
have
calculated
their
descent
with
amazing
subtletytheir
mathematical
learning
is
evidently
far
in
excess
of
oursand
to
have
carried
out
their
preparations
with
a
wellnigh
perfect
unanimity

had
our
instruments
permitted
it
we
might
have
seen
the
gathering
trouble
far
back
in
the
nineteenth
century

men
like
schiaparelli
watched
the
red
planetit
is
odd
bythebye
that
for
countless
centuries
mars
has
been
the
star
of
warbut
failed
to
interpret
the
fluctuating
appearances
of
the
markings
they
mapped
so
well

all
that
time
the
martians
must
have
been
getting
ready

during
the
opposition
of
1894
a
great
light
was
seen
on
the
illuminated
part
of
the
disk
first
at
the
lick
observatory
then
by
perrotin
of
nice
and
then
by
other
observers

english
readers
heard
of
it
first
in
the
issue
of
nature
dated
august
2

I
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
blaze
may
have
been
the
casting
of
the
huge
gun
in
the
vast
pit
sunk
into
their
planet
from
which
their
shots
were
fired
at
us

peculiar
markings
as
yet
unexplained
were
seen
near
the
site
of
that
outbreak
during
the
next
two
oppositions

the
storm
burst
upon
us
six
years
ago
now

as
mars
approached
opposition
lavelle
of
java
set
the
wires
of
the
astronomical
exchange
palpitating
with
the
amazing
intelligence
of
a
huge
outbreak
of
incandescent
gas
upon
the
planet

it
had
occurred
towards
midnight
of
the
twelfth
and
the
spectroscope
to
which
he
had
at
once
resorted
indicated
a
mass
of
flaming
gas
chiefly
hydrogen
moving
with
an
enormous
velocity
towards
this
earth

this
jet
of
fire
had
become
invisible
about
a
quarter
past
twelve

he
compared
it
to
a
colossal
puff
of
flame
suddenly
and
violently
squirted
out
of
the
planet
as
flaming
gases
rushed
out
of
a
gun

a
singularly
appropriate
phrase
it
proved

yet
the
next
day
there
was
nothing
of
this
in
the
papers
except
a
little
note
in
the
daily
telegraph
and
the
world
went
in
ignorance
of
one
of
the
gravest
dangers
that
ever
threatened
the
human
race
I
might
not
have
heard
of
the
eruption
at
all
had
I
not
met
ogilvy
the
wellknown
astronomer
at
ottershaw

he
was
immensely
excited
at
the
news
and
in
the
excess
of
his
feelings
invited
me
up
to
take
a
turn
with
him
that
night
in
a
scrutiny
of
the
red
planet

in
spite
of
all
that
has
happened
since
I
still
remember
that
vigil
very
distinctly
the
black
and
silent
observatory
the
shadowed
lantern
throwing
a
feeble
glow
upon
the
floor
in
the
corner
the
steady
ticking
of
the
clockwork
of
the
telescope
the
little
slit
in
the
roofan
oblong
profundity
with
the
stardust
streaked
across
it
ogilvy
moved
about
invisible
but
audible

looking
through
the
telescope
one
saw
a
circle
of
deep
blue
and
the
little
round
planet
swimming
in
the
field

it
seemed
such
a
little
thing
so
bright
and
small
and
still
faintly
marked
with
transverse
stripes
and
slightly
flattened
from
the
perfect
round

but
so
little
it
was
so
silvery
warma
pin'shead
of
light
it
was
as
if
it
quivered
but
really
this
was
the
telescope
vibrating
with
the
activity
of
the
clockwork
that
kept
the
planet
in
view

as
I
watched
the
planet
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
smaller
and
to
advance
and
recede
but
that
was
simply
that
my
eye
was
tired

forty
millions
of
miles
it
was
from
usmore
than
forty
millions
of
miles
of
void

few
people
realise
the
immensity
of
vacancy
in
which
the
dust
of
the
material
universe
swims

near
it
in
the
field
I
remember
were
three
faint
points
of
light
three
telescopic
stars
infinitely
remote
and
all
around
it
was
the
unfathomable
darkness
of
empty
space

you
know
how
that
blackness
looks
on
a
frosty
starlight
night

in
a
telescope
it
seems
far
profounder

and
invisible
to
me
because
it
was
so
remote
and
small
flying
swiftly
and
steadily
towards
me
across
that
incredible
distance
drawing
nearer
every
minute
by
so
many
thousands
of
miles
came
the
thing
they
were
sending
us
the
thing
that
was
to
bring
so
much
struggle
and
calamity
and
death
to
the
earth

I
never
dreamed
of
it
then
as
I
watched
no
one
on
earth
dreamed
of
that
unerring
missile

that
night
too
there
was
another
jetting
out
of
gas
from
the
distant
planet

I
saw
it

a
reddish
flash
at
the
edge
the
slightest
projection
of
the
outline
just
as
the
chronometer
struck
midnight
and
at
that
I
told
ogilvy
and
he
took
my
place

the
night
was
warm
and
I
was
thirsty
and
I
went
stretching
my
legs
clumsily
and
feeling
my
way
in
the
darkness
to
the
little
table
where
the
siphon
stood
while
ogilvy
exclaimed
at
the
streamer
of
gas
that
came
out
towards
us

that
night
another
invisible
missile
started
on
its
way
to
the
earth
from
mars
just
a
second
or
so
under
twentyfour
hours
after
the
first
one

I
remember
how
I
sat
on
the
table
there
in
the
blackness
with
patches
of
green
and
crimson
swimming
before
my
eyes

I
wished
I
had
a
light
to
smoke
by
little
suspecting
the
meaning
of
the
minute
gleam
I
had
seen
and
all
that
it
would
presently
bring
me

ogilvy
watched
till
one
and
then
gave
it
up
and
we
lit
the
lantern
and
walked
over
to
his
house

down
below
in
the
darkness
were
ottershaw
and
chertsey
and
all
their
hundreds
of
people
sleeping
in
peace

he
was
full
of
speculation
that
night
about
the
condition
of
mars
and
scoffed
at
the
vulgar
idea
of
its
having
inhabitants
who
were
signalling
us

his
idea
was
that
meteorites
might
be
falling
in
a
heavy
shower
upon
the
planet
or
that
a
huge
volcanic
explosion
was
in
progress

he
pointed
out
to
me
how
unlikely
it
was
that
organic
evolution
had
taken
the
same
direction
in
the
two
adjacent
planets

the
chances
against
anything
manlike
on
mars
are
a
million
to
one
he
said

hundreds
of
observers
saw
the
flame
that
night
and
the
night
after
about
midnight
and
again
the
night
after
and
so
for
ten
nights
a
flame
each
night

why
the
shots
ceased
after
the
tenth
no
one
on
earth
has
attempted
to
explain

it
may
be
the
gases
of
the
firing
caused
the
martians
inconvenience

dense
clouds
of
smoke
or
dust
visible
through
a
powerful
telescope
on
earth
as
little
grey
fluctuating
patches
spread
through
the
clearness
of
the
planet's
atmosphere
and
obscured
its
more
familiar
features

even
the
daily
papers
woke
up
to
the
disturbances
at
last
and
popular
notes
appeared
here
there
and
everywhere
concerning
the
volcanoes
upon
mars

the
seriocomic
periodical
punch
I
remember
made
a
happy
use
of
it
in
the
political
cartoon

and
all
unsuspected
those
missiles
the
martians
had
fired
at
us
drew
earthward
rushing
now
at
a
pace
of
many
miles
a
second
through
the
empty
gulf
of
space
hour
by
hour
and
day
by
day
nearer
and
nearer
it
seems
to
me
now
almost
incredibly
wonderful
that
with
that
swift
fate
hanging
over
us
men
could
go
about
their
petty
concerns
as
they
did

I
remember
how
jubilant
markham
was
at
securing
a
new
photograph
of
the
planet
for
the
illustrated
paper
he
edited
in
those
days
people
in
these
latter
times
scarcely
realise
the
abundance
and
enterprise
of
our
nineteenthcentury
papers

for
my
own
part
I
was
much
occupied
in
learning
to
ride
the
bicycle
and
busy
upon
a
series
of
papers
discussing
the
probable
developments
of
moral
ideas
as
civilisation
progressed

one
night
the
first
missile
then
could
scarcely
have
been
10000000
miles
away
I
went
for
a
walk
with
my
wife

it
was
starlight
and
I
explained
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
to
her
and
pointed
out
mars
a
bright
dot
of
light
creeping
zenithward
towards
which
so
many
telescopes
were
pointed

it
was
a
warm
night

coming
home
a
party
of
excursionists
from
chertsey
or
isleworth
passed
us
singing
and
playing
music

there
were
lights
in
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
as
the
people
went
to
bed

from
the
railway
station
in
the
distance
came
the
sound
of
shunting
trains
ringing
and
rumbling
softened
almost
into
melody
by
the
distance

my
wife
pointed
out
to
me
the
brightness
of
the
red
green
and
yellow
signal
lights
hanging
in
a
framework
against
the
sky

it
seemed
so
safe
and
tranquil



chapter
two

the
falling
star


then
came
the
night
of
the
first
falling
star

it
was
seen
early
in
the
morning
rushing
over
winchester
eastward
a
line
of
flame
high
in
the
atmosphere

hundreds
must
have
seen
it
and
taken
it
for
an
ordinary
falling
star

albin
described
it
as
leaving
a
greenish
streak
behind
it
that
glowed
for
some
seconds

denning
our
greatest
authority
on
meteorites
stated
that
the
height
of
its
first
appearance
was
about
ninety
or
one
hundred
miles

it
seemed
to
him
that
it
fell
to
earth
about
one
hundred
miles
east
of
him

I
was
at
home
at
that
hour
and
writing
in
my
study
and
although
my
french
windows
face
towards
ottershaw
and
the
blind
was
up
for
I
loved
in
those
days
to
look
up
at
the
night
sky
I
saw
nothing
of
it
yet
this
strangest
of
all
things
that
ever
came
to
earth
from
outer
space
must
have
fallen
while
I
was
sitting
there
visible
to
me
had
I
only
looked
up
as
it
passed

some
of
those
who
saw
its
flight
say
it
travelled
with
a
hissing
sound

I
myself
heard
nothing
of
that

many
people
in
berkshire
surrey
and
middlesex
must
have
seen
the
fall
of
it
and
at
most
have
thought
that
another
meteorite
had
descended
no
one
seems
to
have
troubled
to
look
for
the
fallen
mass
that
night

but
very
early
in
the
morning
poor
ogilvy
who
had
seen
the
shooting
star
and
who
was
persuaded
that
a
meteorite
lay
somewhere
on
the
common
between
horsell
ottershaw
and
woking
rose
early
with
the
idea
of
finding
it

find
it
he
did
soon
after
dawn
and
not
far
from
the
sand
pits

an
enormous
hole
had
been
made
by
the
impact
of
the
projectile
and
the
sand
and
gravel
had
been
flung
violently
in
every
direction
over
the
heath
forming
heaps
visible
a
mile
and
a
half
away

the
heather
was
on
fire
eastward
and
a
thin
blue
smoke
rose
against
the
dawn

the
thing
itself
lay
almost
entirely
buried
in
sand
amidst
the
scattered
splinters
of
a
fir
tree
it
had
shivered
to
fragments
in
its
descent

the
uncovered
part
had
the
appearance
of
a
huge
cylinder
caked
over
and
its
outline
softened
by
a
thick
scaly
duncoloured
incrustation

it
had
a
diameter
of
about
thirty
yards

he
approached
the
mass
surprised
at
the
size
and
more
so
at
the
shape
since
most
meteorites
are
rounded
more
or
less
completely

it
was
however
still
so
hot
from
its
flight
through
the
air
as
to
forbid
his
near
approach

a
stirring
noise
within
its
cylinder
he
ascribed
to
the
unequal
cooling
of
its
surface
for
at
that
time
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
hollow

he
remained
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
that
the
thing
had
made
for
itself
staring
at
its
strange
appearance
astonished
chiefly
at
its
unusual
shape
and
colour
and
dimly
perceiving
even
then
some
evidence
of
design
in
its
arrival

the
early
morning
was
wonderfully
still
and
the
sun
just
clearing
the
pine
trees
towards
weybridge
was
already
warm

he
did
not
remember
hearing
any
birds
that
morning
there
was
certainly
no
breeze
stirring
and
the
only
sounds
were
the
faint
movements
from
within
the
cindery
cylinder

he
was
all
alone
on
the
common

then
suddenly
he
noticed
with
a
start
that
some
of
the
grey
clinker
the
ashy
incrustation
that
covered
the
meteorite
was
falling
off
the
circular
edge
of
the
end

it
was
dropping
off
in
flakes
and
raining
down
upon
the
sand

a
large
piece
suddenly
came
off
and
fell
with
a
sharp
noise
that
brought
his
heart
into
his
mouth

for
a
minute
he
scarcely
realised
what
this
meant
and
although
the
heat
was
excessive
he
clambered
down
into
the
pit
close
to
the
bulk
to
see
the
thing
more
clearly

he
fancied
even
then
that
the
cooling
of
the
body
might
account
for
this
but
what
disturbed
that
idea
was
the
fact
that
the
ash
was
falling
only
from
the
end
of
the
cylinder

and
then
he
perceived
that
very
slowly
the
circular
top
of
the
cylinder
was
rotating
on
its
body

it
was
such
a
gradual
movement
that
he
discovered
it
only
through
noticing
that
a
black
mark
that
had
been
near
him
five
minutes
ago
was
now
at
the
other
side
of
the
circumference

even
then
he
scarcely
understood
what
this
indicated
until
he
heard
a
muffled
grating
sound
and
saw
the
black
mark
jerk
forward
an
inch
or
so

then
the
thing
came
upon
him
in
a
flash

the
cylinder
was
artificialhollowwith
an
end
that
screwed
out
something
within
the
cylinder
was
unscrewing
the
top

good
heavens
said
ogilvy

there's
a
man
in
itmen
in
it
half
roasted
to
death

trying
to
escape

at
once
with
a
quick
mental
leap
he
linked
the
thing
with
the
flash
upon
mars

the
thought
of
the
confined
creature
was
so
dreadful
to
him
that
he
forgot
the
heat
and
went
forward
to
the
cylinder
to
help
turn

but
luckily
the
dull
radiation
arrested
him
before
he
could
burn
his
hands
on
the
stillglowing
metal

at
that
he
stood
irresolute
for
a
moment
then
turned
scrambled
out
of
the
pit
and
set
off
running
wildly
into
woking

the
time
then
must
have
been
somewhere
about
six
o'clock
he
met
a
waggoner
and
tried
to
make
him
understand
but
the
tale
he
told
and
his
appearance
were
so
wildhis
hat
had
fallen
off
in
the
pitthat
the
man
simply
drove
on

he
was
equally
unsuccessful
with
the
potman
who
was
just
unlocking
the
doors
of
the
publichouse
by
horsell
bridge

the
fellow
thought
he
was
a
lunatic
at
large
and
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
shut
him
into
the
taproom

that
sobered
him
a
little
and
when
he
saw
henderson
the
london
journalist
in
his
garden
he
called
over
the
palings
and
made
himself
understood

henderson
he
called
you
saw
that
shooting
star
last
night

well
said
henderson

it's
out
on
horsell
common
now

good
lord
said
henderson

fallen
meteorite

that's
good

but
it's
something
more
than
a
meteorite

it's
a
cylinderan
artificial
cylinder
man

and
there's
something
inside

henderson
stood
up
with
his
spade
in
his
hand

what's
that
he
said

he
was
deaf
in
one
ear

ogilvy
told
him
all
that
he
had
seen

henderson
was
a
minute
or
so
taking
it
in

then
he
dropped
his
spade
snatched
up
his
jacket
and
came
out
into
the
road

the
two
men
hurried
back
at
once
to
the
common
and
found
the
cylinder
still
lying
in
the
same
position

but
now
the
sounds
inside
had
ceased
and
a
thin
circle
of
bright
metal
showed
between
the
top
and
the
body
of
the
cylinder

air
was
either
entering
or
escaping
at
the
rim
with
a
thin
sizzling
sound

they
listened
rapped
on
the
scaly
burnt
metal
with
a
stick
and
meeting
with
no
response
they
both
concluded
the
man
or
men
inside
must
be
insensible
or
dead

of
course
the
two
were
quite
unable
to
do
anything

they
shouted
consolation
and
promises
and
went
off
back
to
the
town
again
to
get
help

one
can
imagine
them
covered
with
sand
excited
and
disordered
running
up
the
little
street
in
the
bright
sunlight
just
as
the
shop
folks
were
taking
down
their
shutters
and
people
were
opening
their
bedroom
windows

henderson
went
into
the
railway
station
at
once
in
order
to
telegraph
the
news
to
london

the
newspaper
articles
had
prepared
men's
minds
for
the
reception
of
the
idea

by
eight
o'clock
a
number
of
boys
and
unemployed
men
had
already
started
for
the
common
to
see
the
dead
men
from
mars

that
was
the
form
the
story
took

I
heard
of
it
first
from
my
newspaper
boy
about
a
quarter
to
nine
when
I
went
out
to
get
my
daily
chronicle

I
was
naturally
startled
and
lost
no
time
in
going
out
and
across
the
ottershaw
bridge
to
the
sand
pits



chapter
three

on
horsell
common


I
found
a
little
crowd
of
perhaps
twenty
people
surrounding
the
huge
hole
in
which
the
cylinder
lay

I
have
already
described
the
appearance
of
that
colossal
bulk
embedded
in
the
ground

the
turf
and
gravel
about
it
seemed
charred
as
if
by
a
sudden
explosion

no
doubt
its
impact
had
caused
a
flash
of
fire

henderson
and
ogilvy
were
not
there

I
think
they
perceived
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
for
the
present
and
had
gone
away
to
breakfast
at
henderson's
house

there
were
four
or
five
boys
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
with
their
feet
dangling
and
amusing
themselvesuntil
I
stopped
themby
throwing
stones
at
the
giant
mass

after
I
had
spoken
to
them
about
it
they
began
playing
at
touch
in
and
out
of
the
group
of
bystanders

among
these
were
a
couple
of
cyclists
a
jobbing
gardener
I
employed
sometimes
a
girl
carrying
a
baby
gregg
the
butcher
and
his
little
boy
and
two
or
three
loafers
and
golf
caddies
who
were
accustomed
to
hang
about
the
railway
station

there
was
very
little
talking

few
of
the
common
people
in
england
had
anything
but
the
vaguest
astronomical
ideas
in
those
days

most
of
them
were
staring
quietly
at
the
big
table
like
end
of
the
cylinder
which
was
still
as
ogilvy
and
henderson
had
left
it

I
fancy
the
popular
expectation
of
a
heap
of
charred
corpses
was
disappointed
at
this
inanimate
bulk
some
went
away
while
I
was
there
and
other
people
came

I
clambered
into
the
pit
and
fancied
I
heard
a
faint
movement
under
my
feet

the
top
had
certainly
ceased
to
rotate

it
was
only
when
I
got
thus
close
to
it
that
the
strangeness
of
this
object
was
at
all
evident
to
me

at
the
first
glance
it
was
really
no
more
exciting
than
an
overturned
carriage
or
a
tree
blown
across
the
road

not
so
much
so
indeed

it
looked
like
a
rusty
gas
float

it
required
a
certain
amount
of
scientific
education
to
perceive
that
the
grey
scale
of
the
thing
was
no
common
oxide
that
the
yellowishwhite
metal
that
gleamed
in
the
crack
between
the
lid
and
the
cylinder
had
an
unfamiliar
hue

extraterrestrial
had
no
meaning
for
most
of
the
onlookers

at
that
time
it
was
quite
clear
in
my
own
mind
that
the
thing
had
come
from
the
planet
mars
but
I
judged
it
improbable
that
it
contained
any
living
creature

I
thought
the
unscrewing
might
be
automatic

in
spite
of
ogilvy
I
still
believed
that
there
were
men
in
mars

my
mind
ran
fancifully
on
the
possibilities
of
its
containing
manuscript
on
the
difficulties
in
translation
that
might
arise
whether
we
should
find
coins
and
models
in
it
and
so
forth
yet
it
was
a
little
too
large
for
assurance
on
this
idea

I
felt
an
impatience
to
see
it
opened

about
eleven
as
nothing
seemed
happening
I
walked
back
full
of
such
thought
to
my
home
in
maybury
but
I
found
it
difficult
to
get
to
work
upon
my
abstract
investigations

in
the
afternoon
the
appearance
of
the
common
had
altered
very
much

the
early
editions
of
the
evening
papers
had
startled
london
with
enormous
headlines



a
message
received
from
mars



remarkable
story
from
woking

and
so
forth

in
addition
ogilvy's
wire
to
the
astronomical
exchange
had
roused
every
observatory
in
the
three
kingdoms

there
were
half
a
dozen
flies
or
more
from
the
woking
station
standing
in
the
road
by
the
sand
pits
a
basketchaise
from
chobham
and
a
rather
lordly
carriage

besides
that
there
was
quite
a
heap
of
bicycles

in
addition
a
large
number
of
people
must
have
walked
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
day
from
woking
and
chertsey
so
that
there
was
altogether
quite
a
considerable
crowdone
or
two
gaily
dressed
ladies
among
the
others

it
was
glaringly
hot
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
nor
a
breath
of
wind
and
the
only
shadow
was
that
of
the
few
scattered
pine
trees

the
burning
heather
had
been
extinguished
but
the
level
ground
towards
ottershaw
was
blackened
as
far
as
one
could
see
and
still
giving
off
vertical
streamers
of
smoke

an
enterprising
sweetstuff
dealer
in
the
chobham
road
had
sent
up
his
son
with
a
barrowload
of
green
apples
and
ginger
beer

going
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
I
found
it
occupied
by
a
group
of
about
half
a
dozen
menhenderson
ogilvy
and
a
tall
fairhaired
man
that
I
afterwards
learned
was
stent
the
astronomer
royal
with
several
workmen
wielding
spades
and
pickaxes

stent
was
giving
directions
in
a
clear
highpitched
voice

he
was
standing
on
the
cylinder
which
was
now
evidently
much
cooler
his
face
was
crimson
and
streaming
with
perspiration
and
something
seemed
to
have
irritated
him

a
large
portion
of
the
cylinder
had
been
uncovered
though
its
lower
end
was
still
embedded

as
soon
as
ogilvy
saw
me
among
the
staring
crowd
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
called
to
me
to
come
down
and
asked
me
if
I
would
mind
going
over
to
see
lord
hilton
the
lord
of
the
manor

the
growing
crowd
he
said
was
becoming
a
serious
impediment
to
their
excavations
especially
the
boys

they
wanted
a
light
railing
put
up
and
help
to
keep
the
people
back

he
told
me
that
a
faint
stirring
was
occasionally
still
audible
within
the
case
but
that
the
workmen
had
failed
to
unscrew
the
top
as
it
afforded
no
grip
to
them
the
case
appeared
to
be
enormously
thick
and
it
was
possible
that
the
faint
sounds
we
heard
represented
a
noisy
tumult
in
the
interior

I
was
very
glad
to
do
as
he
asked
and
so
become
one
of
the
privileged
spectators
within
the
contemplated
enclosure

I
failed
to
find
lord
hilton
at
his
house
but
I
was
told
he
was
expected
from
london
by
the
six
o'clock
train
from
waterloo
and
as
it
was
then
about
a
quarter
past
five
I
went
home
had
some
tea
and
walked
up
to
the
station
to
waylay
him



chapter
four

the
cylinder
opens


when
I
returned
to
the
common
the
sun
was
setting

scattered
groups
were
hurrying
from
the
direction
of
woking
and
one
or
two
persons
were
returning

the
crowd
about
the
pit
had
increased
and
stood
out
black
against
the
lemon
yellow
of
the
skya
couple
of
hundred
people
perhaps

there
were
raised
voices
and
some
sort
of
struggle
appeared
to
be
going
on
about
the
pit

strange
imaginings
passed
through
my
mind

as
I
drew
nearer
I
heard
stent's
voice

keep
back

keep
back

a
boy
came
running
towards
me

it's
amovin'
he
said
to
me
as
he
passed
ascrewin'
and
ascrewin'
out

I
don't
like
it

i'm
agoin'
'ome
I
am

I
went
on
to
the
crowd

there
were
really
I
should
think
two
or
three
hundred
people
elbowing
and
jostling
one
another
the
one
or
two
ladies
there
being
by
no
means
the
least
active

he's
fallen
in
the
pit
cried
some
one

keep
back
said
several

the
crowd
swayed
a
little
and
I
elbowed
my
way
through

every
one
seemed
greatly
excited

I
heard
a
peculiar
humming
sound
from
the
pit

I
say
said
ogilvy
help
keep
these
idiots
back

we
don't
know
what's
in
the
confounded
thing
you
know

I
saw
a
young
man
a
shop
assistant
in
woking
I
believe
he
was
standing
on
the
cylinder
and
trying
to
scramble
out
of
the
hole
again
the
crowd
had
pushed
him
in

the
end
of
the
cylinder
was
being
screwed
out
from
within

nearly
two
feet
of
shining
screw
projected

somebody
blundered
against
me
and
I
narrowly
missed
being
pitched
onto
the
top
of
the
screw

I
turned
and
as
I
did
so
the
screw
must
have
come
out
for
the
lid
of
the
cylinder
fell
upon
the
gravel
with
a
ringing
concussion

I
stuck
my
elbow
into
the
person
behind
me
and
turned
my
head
towards
the
thing
again

for
a
moment
that
circular
cavity
seemed
perfectly
black
I
had
the
sunset
in
my
eyes

I
think
everyone
expected
to
see
a
man
emergepossibly
something
a
little
unlike
us
terrestrial
men
but
in
all
essentials
a
man

I
know
I
did

but
looking
I
presently
saw
something
stirring
within
the
shadow
greyish
billowy
movements
one
above
another
and
then
two
luminous
diskslike
eyes

then
something
resembling
a
little
grey
snake
about
the
thickness
of
a
walking
stick
coiled
up
out
of
the
writhing
middle
and
wriggled
in
the
air
towards
meand
then
another

a
sudden
chill
came
over
me

there
was
a
loud
shriek
from
a
woman
behind

I
half
turned
keeping
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
cylinder
still
from
which
other
tentacles
were
now
projecting
and
began
pushing
my
way
back
from
the
edge
of
the
pit

I
saw
astonishment
giving
place
to
horror
on
the
faces
of
the
people
about
me

I
heard
inarticulate
exclamations
on
all
sides

there
was
a
general
movement
backwards
I
saw
the
shopman
struggling
still
on
the
edge
of
the
pit

I
found
myself
alone
and
saw
the
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
pit
running
off
stent
among
them

I
looked
again
at
the
cylinder
and
ungovernable
terror
gripped
me

I
stood
petrified
and
staring

a
big
greyish
rounded
bulk
the
size
perhaps
of
a
bear
was
rising
slowly
and
painfully
out
of
the
cylinder

as
it
bulged
up
and
caught
the
light
it
glistened
like
wet
leather

two
large
darkcoloured
eyes
were
regarding
me
steadfastly

the
mass
that
framed
them
the
head
of
the
thing
was
rounded
and
had
one
might
say
a
face

there
was
a
mouth
under
the
eyes
the
lipless
brim
of
which
quivered
and
panted
and
dropped
saliva

the
whole
creature
heaved
and
pulsated
convulsively

a
lank
tentacular
appendage
gripped
the
edge
of
the
cylinder
another
swayed
in
the
air

those
who
have
never
seen
a
living
martian
can
scarcely
imagine
the
strange
horror
of
its
appearance

the
peculiar
vshaped
mouth
with
its
pointed
upper
lip
the
absence
of
brow
ridges
the
absence
of
a
chin
beneath
the
wedgelike
lower
lip
the
incessant
quivering
of
this
mouth
the
gorgon
groups
of
tentacles
the
tumultuous
breathing
of
the
lungs
in
a
strange
atmosphere
the
evident
heaviness
and
painfulness
of
movement
due
to
the
greater
gravitational
energy
of
the
earthabove
all
the
extraordinary
intensity
of
the
immense
eyeswere
at
once
vital
intense
inhuman
crippled
and
monstrous

there
was
something
fungoid
in
the
oily
brown
skin
something
in
the
clumsy
deliberation
of
the
tedious
movements
unspeakably
nasty

even
at
this
first
encounter
this
first
glimpse
I
was
overcome
with
disgust
and
dread

suddenly
the
monster
vanished

it
had
toppled
over
the
brim
of
the
cylinder
and
fallen
into
the
pit
with
a
thud
like
the
fall
of
a
great
mass
of
leather

I
heard
it
give
a
peculiar
thick
cry
and
forthwith
another
of
these
creatures
appeared
darkly
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
aperture

I
turned
and
running
madly
made
for
the
first
group
of
trees
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
away
but
I
ran
slantingly
and
stumbling
for
I
could
not
avert
my
face
from
these
things

there
among
some
young
pine
trees
and
furze
bushes
I
stopped
panting
and
waited
further
developments

the
common
round
the
sand
pits
was
dotted
with
people
standing
like
myself
in
a
halffascinated
terror
staring
at
these
creatures
or
rather
at
the
heaped
gravel
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
in
which
they
lay

and
then
with
a
renewed
horror
I
saw
a
round
black
object
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
edge
of
the
pit

it
was
the
head
of
the
shopman
who
had
fallen
in
but
showing
as
a
little
black
object
against
the
hot
western
sun

now
he
got
his
shoulder
and
knee
up
and
again
he
seemed
to
slip
back
until
only
his
head
was
visible

suddenly
he
vanished
and
I
could
have
fancied
a
faint
shriek
had
reached
me

I
had
a
momentary
impulse
to
go
back
and
help
him
that
my
fears
overruled

everything
was
then
quite
invisible
hidden
by
the
deep
pit
and
the
heap
of
sand
that
the
fall
of
the
cylinder
had
made

anyone
coming
along
the
road
from
chobham
or
woking
would
have
been
amazed
at
the
sighta
dwindling
multitude
of
perhaps
a
hundred
people
or
more
standing
in
a
great
irregular
circle
in
ditches
behind
bushes
behind
gates
and
hedges
saying
little
to
one
another
and
that
in
short
excited
shouts
and
staring
staring
hard
at
a
few
heaps
of
sand

the
barrow
of
ginger
beer
stood
a
queer
derelict
black
against
the
burning
sky
and
in
the
sand
pits
was
a
row
of
deserted
vehicles
with
their
horses
feeding
out
of
nosebags
or
pawing
the
ground



chapter
five

the
heatray


after
the
glimpse
I
had
had
of
the
martians
emerging
from
the
cylinder
in
which
they
had
come
to
the
earth
from
their
planet
a
kind
of
fascination
paralysed
my
actions

I
remained
standing
kneedeep
in
the
heather
staring
at
the
mound
that
hid
them

I
was
a
battleground
of
fear
and
curiosity

I
did
not
dare
to
go
back
towards
the
pit
but
I
felt
a
passionate
longing
to
peer
into
it

I
began
walking
therefore
in
a
big
curve
seeking
some
point
of
vantage
and
continually
looking
at
the
sand
heaps
that
hid
these
newcomers
to
our
earth

once
a
leash
of
thin
black
whips
like
the
arms
of
an
octopus
flashed
across
the
sunset
and
was
immediately
withdrawn
and
afterwards
a
thin
rod
rose
up
joint
by
joint
bearing
at
its
apex
a
circular
disk
that
spun
with
a
wobbling
motion

what
could
be
going
on
there

most
of
the
spectators
had
gathered
in
one
or
two
groupsone
a
little
crowd
towards
woking
the
other
a
knot
of
people
in
the
direction
of
chobham

evidently
they
shared
my
mental
conflict
there
were
few
near
me

one
man
I
approachedhe
was
I
perceived
a
neighbour
of
mine
though
I
did
not
know
his
nameand
accosted
but
it
was
scarcely
a
time
for
articulate
conversation

what
ugly
brutes
he
said

good
god

what
ugly
brutes

he
repeated
this
over
and
over
again

did
you
see
a
man
in
the
pit
I
said
but
he
made
no
answer
to
that

we
became
silent
and
stood
watching
for
a
time
side
by
side
deriving
I
fancy
a
certain
comfort
in
one
another's
company

then
I
shifted
my
position
to
a
little
knoll
that
gave
me
the
advantage
of
a
yard
or
more
of
elevation
and
when
I
looked
for
him
presently
he
was
walking
towards
woking

the
sunset
faded
to
twilight
before
anything
further
happened

the
crowd
far
away
on
the
left
towards
woking
seemed
to
grow
and
I
heard
now
a
faint
murmur
from
it

the
little
knot
of
people
towards
chobham
dispersed

there
was
scarcely
an
intimation
of
movement
from
the
pit

it
was
this
as
much
as
anything
that
gave
people
courage
and
I
suppose
the
new
arrivals
from
woking
also
helped
to
restore
confidence

at
any
rate
as
the
dusk
came
on
a
slow
intermittent
movement
upon
the
sand
pits
began
a
movement
that
seemed
to
gather
force
as
the
stillness
of
the
evening
about
the
cylinder
remained
unbroken

vertical
black
figures
in
twos
and
threes
would
advance
stop
watch
and
advance
again
spreading
out
as
they
did
so
in
a
thin
irregular
crescent
that
promised
to
enclose
the
pit
in
its
attenuated
horns

I
too
on
my
side
began
to
move
towards
the
pit

then
I
saw
some
cabmen
and
others
had
walked
boldly
into
the
sand
pits
and
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
gride
of
wheels

I
saw
a
lad
trundling
off
the
barrow
of
apples

and
then
within
thirty
yards
of
the
pit
advancing
from
the
direction
of
horsell
I
noted
a
little
black
knot
of
men
the
foremost
of
whom
was
waving
a
white
flag

this
was
the
deputation

there
had
been
a
hasty
consultation
and
since
the
martians
were
evidently
in
spite
of
their
repulsive
forms
intelligent
creatures
it
had
been
resolved
to
show
them
by
approaching
them
with
signals
that
we
too
were
intelligent

flutter
flutter
went
the
flag
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left

it
was
too
far
for
me
to
recognise
anyone
there
but
afterwards
I
learned
that
ogilvy
stent
and
henderson
were
with
others
in
this
attempt
at
communication

this
little
group
had
in
its
advance
dragged
inward
so
to
speak
the
circumference
of
the
now
almost
complete
circle
of
people
and
a
number
of
dim
black
figures
followed
it
at
discreet
distances

suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
a
quantity
of
luminous
greenish
smoke
came
out
of
the
pit
in
three
distinct
puffs
which
drove
up
one
after
the
other
straight
into
the
still
air

this
smoke
or
flame
perhaps
would
be
the
better
word
for
it
was
so
bright
that
the
deep
blue
sky
overhead
and
the
hazy
stretches
of
brown
common
towards
chertsey
set
with
black
pine
trees
seemed
to
darken
abruptly
as
these
puffs
arose
and
to
remain
the
darker
after
their
dispersal

at
the
same
time
a
faint
hissing
sound
became
audible

beyond
the
pit
stood
the
little
wedge
of
people
with
the
white
flag
at
its
apex
arrested
by
these
phenomena
a
little
knot
of
small
vertical
black
shapes
upon
the
black
ground

as
the
green
smoke
arose
their
faces
flashed
out
pallid
green
and
faded
again
as
it
vanished
then
slowly
the
hissing
passed
into
a
humming
into
a
long
loud
droning
noise

slowly
a
humped
shape
rose
out
of
the
pit
and
the
ghost
of
a
beam
of
light
seemed
to
flicker
out
from
it

forthwith
flashes
of
actual
flame
a
bright
glare
leaping
from
one
to
another
sprang
from
the
scattered
group
of
men

it
was
as
if
some
invisible
jet
impinged
upon
them
and
flashed
into
white
flame

it
was
as
if
each
man
were
suddenly
and
momentarily
turned
to
fire

then
by
the
light
of
their
own
destruction
I
saw
them
staggering
and
falling
and
their
supporters
turning
to
run

I
stood
staring
not
as
yet
realising
that
this
was
death
leaping
from
man
to
man
in
that
little
distant
crowd

all
I
felt
was
that
it
was
something
very
strange

an
almost
noiseless
and
blinding
flash
of
light
and
a
man
fell
headlong
and
lay
still
and
as
the
unseen
shaft
of
heat
passed
over
them
pine
trees
burst
into
fire
and
every
dry
furze
bush
became
with
one
dull
thud
a
mass
of
flames

and
far
away
towards
knaphill
I
saw
the
flashes
of
trees
and
hedges
and
wooden
buildings
suddenly
set
alight

it
was
sweeping
round
swiftly
and
steadily
this
flaming
death
this
invisible
inevitable
sword
of
heat

I
perceived
it
coming
towards
me
by
the
flashing
bushes
it
touched
and
was
too
astounded
and
stupefied
to
stir

I
heard
the
crackle
of
fire
in
the
sand
pits
and
the
sudden
squeal
of
a
horse
that
was
as
suddenly
stilled

then
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
yet
intensely
heated
finger
were
drawn
through
the
heather
between
me
and
the
martians
and
all
along
a
curving
line
beyond
the
sand
pits
the
dark
ground
smoked
and
crackled
something
fell
with
a
crash
far
away
to
the
left
where
the
road
from
woking
station
opens
out
on
the
common

forthwith
the
hissing
and
humming
ceased
and
the
black
domelike
object
sank
slowly
out
of
sight
into
the
pit

all
this
had
happened
with
such
swiftness
that
I
had
stood
motionless
dumbfounded
and
dazzled
by
the
flashes
of
light

had
that
death
swept
through
a
full
circle
it
must
inevitably
have
slain
me
in
my
surprise

but
it
passed
and
spared
me
and
left
the
night
about
me
suddenly
dark
and
unfamiliar

the
undulating
common
seemed
now
dark
almost
to
blackness
except
where
its
roadways
lay
grey
and
pale
under
the
deep
blue
sky
of
the
early
night

it
was
dark
and
suddenly
void
of
men

overhead
the
stars
were
mustering
and
in
the
west
the
sky
was
still
a
pale
bright
almost
greenish
blue

the
tops
of
the
pine
trees
and
the
roofs
of
horsell
came
out
sharp
and
black
against
the
western
afterglow

the
martians
and
their
appliances
were
altogether
invisible
save
for
that
thin
mast
upon
which
their
restless
mirror
wobbled

patches
of
bush
and
isolated
trees
here
and
there
smoked
and
glowed
still
and
the
houses
towards
woking
station
were
sending
up
spires
of
flame
into
the
stillness
of
the
evening
air

nothing
was
changed
save
for
that
and
a
terrible
astonishment

the
little
group
of
black
specks
with
the
flag
of
white
had
been
swept
out
of
existence
and
the
stillness
of
the
evening
so
it
seemed
to
me
had
scarcely
been
broken

it
came
to
me
that
I
was
upon
this
dark
common
helpless
unprotected
and
alone

suddenly
like
a
thing
falling
upon
me
from
without
camefear

with
an
effort
I
turned
and
began
a
stumbling
run
through
the
heather

the
fear
I
felt
was
no
rational
fear
but
a
panic
terror
not
only
of
the
martians
but
of
the
dusk
and
stillness
all
about
me

such
an
extraordinary
effect
in
unmanning
me
it
had
that
I
ran
weeping
silently
as
a
child
might
do

once
I
had
turned
I
did
not
dare
to
look
back

I
remember
I
felt
an
extraordinary
persuasion
that
I
was
being
played
with
that
presently
when
I
was
upon
the
very
verge
of
safety
this
mysterious
deathas
swift
as
the
passage
of
lightwould
leap
after
me
from
the
pit
about
the
cylinder
and
strike
me
down



chapter
six

the
heatray
in
the
chobham
road


it
is
still
a
matter
of
wonder
how
the
martians
are
able
to
slay
men
so
swiftly
and
so
silently

many
think
that
in
some
way
they
are
able
to
generate
an
intense
heat
in
a
chamber
of
practically
absolute
nonconductivity

this
intense
heat
they
project
in
a
parallel
beam
against
any
object
they
choose
by
means
of
a
polished
parabolic
mirror
of
unknown
composition
much
as
the
parabolic
mirror
of
a
lighthouse
projects
a
beam
of
light

but
no
one
has
absolutely
proved
these
details

however
it
is
done
it
is
certain
that
a
beam
of
heat
is
the
essence
of
the
matter

heat
and
invisible
instead
of
visible
light

whatever
is
combustible
flashes
into
flame
at
its
touch
lead
runs
like
water
it
softens
iron
cracks
and
melts
glass
and
when
it
falls
upon
water
incontinently
that
explodes
into
steam

that
night
nearly
forty
people
lay
under
the
starlight
about
the
pit
charred
and
distorted
beyond
recognition
and
all
night
long
the
common
from
horsell
to
maybury
was
deserted
and
brightly
ablaze

the
news
of
the
massacre
probably
reached
chobham
woking
and
ottershaw
about
the
same
time

in
woking
the
shops
had
closed
when
the
tragedy
happened
and
a
number
of
people
shop
people
and
so
forth
attracted
by
the
stories
they
had
heard
were
walking
over
the
horsell
bridge
and
along
the
road
between
the
hedges
that
runs
out
at
last
upon
the
common

you
may
imagine
the
young
people
brushed
up
after
the
labours
of
the
day
and
making
this
novelty
as
they
would
make
any
novelty
the
excuse
for
walking
together
and
enjoying
a
trivial
flirtation

you
may
figure
to
yourself
the
hum
of
voices
along
the
road
in
the
gloaming




as
yet
of
course
few
people
in
woking
even
knew
that
the
cylinder
had
opened
though
poor
henderson
had
sent
a
messenger
on
a
bicycle
to
the
post
office
with
a
special
wire
to
an
evening
paper

as
these
folks
came
out
by
twos
and
threes
upon
the
open
they
found
little
knots
of
people
talking
excitedly
and
peering
at
the
spinning
mirror
over
the
sand
pits
and
the
newcomers
were
no
doubt
soon
infected
by
the
excitement
of
the
occasion

by
half
past
eight
when
the
deputation
was
destroyed
there
may
have
been
a
crowd
of
three
hundred
people
or
more
at
this
place
besides
those
who
had
left
the
road
to
approach
the
martians
nearer
there
were
three
policemen
too
one
of
whom
was
mounted
doing
their
best
under
instructions
from
stent
to
keep
the
people
back
and
deter
them
from
approaching
the
cylinder

there
was
some
booing
from
those
more
thoughtless
and
excitable
souls
to
whom
a
crowd
is
always
an
occasion
for
noise
and
horseplay

stent
and
ogilvy
anticipating
some
possibilities
of
a
collision
had
telegraphed
from
horsell
to
the
barracks
as
soon
as
the
martians
emerged
for
the
help
of
a
company
of
soldiers
to
protect
these
strange
creatures
from
violence

after
that
they
returned
to
lead
that
illfated
advance

the
description
of
their
death
as
it
was
seen
by
the
crowd
tallies
very
closely
with
my
own
impressions
the
three
puffs
of
green
smoke
the
deep
humming
note
and
the
flashes
of
flame

but
that
crowd
of
people
had
a
far
narrower
escape
than
mine

only
the
fact
that
a
hummock
of
heathery
sand
intercepted
the
lower
part
of
the
heatray
saved
them

had
the
elevation
of
the
parabolic
mirror
been
a
few
yards
higher
none
could
have
lived
to
tell
the
tale

they
saw
the
flashes
and
the
men
falling
and
an
invisible
hand
as
it
were
lit
the
bushes
as
it
hurried
towards
them
through
the
twilight

then
with
a
whistling
note
that
rose
above
the
droning
of
the
pit
the
beam
swung
close
over
their
heads
lighting
the
tops
of
the
beech
trees
that
line
the
road
and
splitting
the
bricks
smashing
the
windows
firing
the
window
frames
and
bringing
down
in
crumbling
ruin
a
portion
of
the
gable
of
the
house
nearest
the
corner

in
the
sudden
thud
hiss
and
glare
of
the
igniting
trees
the
panicstricken
crowd
seems
to
have
swayed
hesitatingly
for
some
moments

sparks
and
burning
twigs
began
to
fall
into
the
road
and
single
leaves
like
puffs
of
flame

hats
and
dresses
caught
fire

then
came
a
crying
from
the
common

there
were
shrieks
and
shouts
and
suddenly
a
mounted
policeman
came
galloping
through
the
confusion
with
his
hands
clasped
over
his
head
screaming

they're
coming
a
woman
shrieked
and
incontinently
everyone
was
turning
and
pushing
at
those
behind
in
order
to
clear
their
way
to
woking
again

they
must
have
bolted
as
blindly
as
a
flock
of
sheep
where
the
road
grows
narrow
and
black
between
the
high
banks
the
crowd
jammed
and
a
desperate
struggle
occurred

all
that
crowd
did
not
escape
three
persons
at
least
two
women
and
a
little
boy
were
crushed
and
trampled
there
and
left
to
die
amid
the
terror
and
the
darkness



chapter
seven

how
I
reached
home


for
my
own
part
I
remember
nothing
of
my
flight
except
the
stress
of
blundering
against
trees
and
stumbling
through
the
heather

all
about
me
gathered
the
invisible
terrors
of
the
martians
that
pitiless
sword
of
heat
seemed
whirling
to
and
fro
flourishing
overhead
before
it
descended
and
smote
me
out
of
life

I
came
into
the
road
between
the
crossroads
and
horsell
and
ran
along
this
to
the
crossroads

at
last
I
could
go
no
further
I
was
exhausted
with
the
violence
of
my
emotion
and
of
my
flight
and
I
staggered
and
fell
by
the
wayside
that
was
near
the
bridge
that
crosses
the
canal
by
the
gasworks

I
fell
and
lay
still

I
must
have
remained
there
some
time

I
sat
up
strangely
perplexed

for
a
moment
perhaps
I
could
not
clearly
understand
how
I
came
there

my
terror
had
fallen
from
me
like
a
garment

my
hat
had
gone
and
my
collar
had
burst
away
from
its
fastener

a
few
minutes
before
there
had
only
been
three
real
things
before
methe
immensity
of
the
night
and
space
and
nature
my
own
feebleness
and
anguish
and
the
near
approach
of
death

now
it
was
as
if
something
turned
over
and
the
point
of
view
altered
abruptly

there
was
no
sensible
transition
from
one
state
of
mind
to
the
other

I
was
immediately
the
self
of
every
day
againa
decent
ordinary
citizen

the
silent
common
the
impulse
of
my
flight
the
starting
flames
were
as
if
they
had
been
in
a
dream

I
asked
myself
had
these
latter
things
indeed
happened

I
could
not
credit
it

I
rose
and
walked
unsteadily
up
the
steep
incline
of
the
bridge

my
mind
was
blank
wonder

my
muscles
and
nerves
seemed
drained
of
their
strength

I
dare
say
I
staggered
drunkenly

a
head
rose
over
the
arch
and
the
figure
of
a
workman
carrying
a
basket
appeared

beside
him
ran
a
little
boy

he
passed
me
wishing
me
good
night

I
was
minded
to
speak
to
him
but
did
not

I
answered
his
greeting
with
a
meaningless
mumble
and
went
on
over
the
bridge

over
the
maybury
arch
a
train
a
billowing
tumult
of
white
firelit
smoke
and
a
long
caterpillar
of
lighted
windows
went
flying
southclatter
clatter
clap
rap
and
it
had
gone

a
dim
group
of
people
talked
in
the
gate
of
one
of
the
houses
in
the
pretty
little
row
of
gables
that
was
called
oriental
terrace

it
was
all
so
real
and
so
familiar

and
that
behind
me

it
was
frantic
fantastic
such
things
I
told
myself
could
not
be

perhaps
I
am
a
man
of
exceptional
moods

I
do
not
know
how
far
my
experience
is
common

at
times
I
suffer
from
the
strangest
sense
of
detachment
from
myself
and
the
world
about
me
I
seem
to
watch
it
all
from
the
outside
from
somewhere
inconceivably
remote
out
of
time
out
of
space
out
of
the
stress
and
tragedy
of
it
all

this
feeling
was
very
strong
upon
me
that
night

here
was
another
side
to
my
dream

but
the
trouble
was
the
blank
incongruity
of
this
serenity
and
the
swift
death
flying
yonder
not
two
miles
away

there
was
a
noise
of
business
from
the
gasworks
and
the
electric
lamps
were
all
alight

I
stopped
at
the
group
of
people

what
news
from
the
common
said
I

there
were
two
men
and
a
woman
at
the
gate

eh
said
one
of
the
men
turning

what
news
from
the
common
I
said

'ain't
yer
just
been
there
asked
the
men

people
seem
fair
silly
about
the
common
said
the
woman
over
the
gate

what's
it
all
abart

haven't
you
heard
of
the
men
from
mars
said
I
the
creatures
from
mars

quite
enough
said
the
woman
over
the
gate

thenks
and
all
three
of
them
laughed

I
felt
foolish
and
angry

I
tried
and
found
I
could
not
tell
them
what
I
had
seen

they
laughed
again
at
my
broken
sentences

you'll
hear
more
yet
I
said
and
went
on
to
my
home

I
startled
my
wife
at
the
doorway
so
haggard
was
I

I
went
into
the
dining
room
sat
down
drank
some
wine
and
so
soon
as
I
could
collect
myself
sufficiently
I
told
her
the
things
I
had
seen

the
dinner
which
was
a
cold
one
had
already
been
served
and
remained
neglected
on
the
table
while
I
told
my
story

there
is
one
thing
I
said
to
allay
the
fears
I
had
aroused
they
are
the
most
sluggish
things
I
ever
saw
crawl

they
may
keep
the
pit
and
kill
people
who
come
near
them
but
they
cannot
get
out
of
it




but
the
horror
of
them

don't
dear
said
my
wife
knitting
her
brows
and
putting
her
hand
on
mine

poor
ogilvy
I
said

to
think
he
may
be
lying
dead
there

my
wife
at
least
did
not
find
my
experience
incredible

when
I
saw
how
deadly
white
her
face
was
I
ceased
abruptly

they
may
come
here
she
said
again
and
again

I
pressed
her
to
take
wine
and
tried
to
reassure
her

they
can
scarcely
move
I
said

I
began
to
comfort
her
and
myself
by
repeating
all
that
ogilvy
had
told
me
of
the
impossibility
of
the
martians
establishing
themselves
on
the
earth

in
particular
I
laid
stress
on
the
gravitational
difficulty

on
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
force
of
gravity
is
three
times
what
it
is
on
the
surface
of
mars

a
martian
therefore
would
weigh
three
times
more
than
on
mars
albeit
his
muscular
strength
would
be
the
same

his
own
body
would
be
a
cope
of
lead
to
him

that
indeed
was
the
general
opinion

both
the
times
and
the
daily
telegraph
for
instance
insisted
on
it
the
next
morning
and
both
overlooked
just
as
I
did
two
obvious
modifying
influences

the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
we
now
know
contains
far
more
oxygen
or
far
less
argon
whichever
way
one
likes
to
put
it
than
does
mars
the
invigorating
influences
of
this
excess
of
oxygen
upon
the
martians
indisputably
did
much
to
counterbalance
the
increased
weight
of
their
bodies

and
in
the
second
place
we
all
overlooked
the
fact
that
such
mechanical
intelligence
as
the
martian
possessed
was
quite
able
to
dispense
with
muscular
exertion
at
a
pinch

but
I
did
not
consider
these
points
at
the
time
and
so
my
reasoning
was
dead
against
the
chances
of
the
invaders

with
wine
and
food
the
confidence
of
my
own
table
and
the
necessity
of
reassuring
my
wife
I
grew
by
insensible
degrees
courageous
and
secure

they
have
done
a
foolish
thing
said
I
fingering
my
wineglass
they
are
dangerous
because
no
doubt
they
are
mad
with
terror
perhaps
they
expected
to
find
no
living
thingscertainly
no
intelligent
living
things

a
shell
in
the
pit
said
I
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
will
kill
them
all

the
intense
excitement
of
the
events
had
no
doubt
left
my
perceptive
powers
in
a
state
of
erethism

I
remember
that
dinner
table
with
extraordinary
vividness
even
now

my
dear
wife's
sweet
anxious
face
peering
at
me
from
under
the
pink
lamp
shade
the
white
cloth
with
its
silver
and
glass
table
furniturefor
in
those
days
even
philosophical
writers
had
many
little
luxuriesthe
crimsonpurple
wine
in
my
glass
are
photographically
distinct

at
the
end
of
it
I
sat
tempering
nuts
with
a
cigarette
regretting
ogilvy's
rashness
and
denouncing
the
shortsighted
timidity
of
the
martians

so
some
respectable
dodo
in
the
mauritius
might
have
lorded
it
in
his
nest
and
discussed
the
arrival
of
that
shipful
of
pitiless
sailors
in
want
of
animal
food

we
will
peck
them
to
death
tomorrow
my
dear

I
did
not
know
it
but
that
was
the
last
civilised
dinner
I
was
to
eat
for
very
many
strange
and
terrible
days



chapter
eight

friday
night


the
most
extraordinary
thing
to
my
mind
of
all
the
strange
and
wonderful
things
that
happened
upon
that
friday
was
the
dovetailing
of
the
commonplace
habits
of
our
social
order
with
the
first
beginnings
of
the
series
of
events
that
was
to
topple
that
social
order
headlong

if
on
friday
night
you
had
taken
a
pair
of
compasses
and
drawn
a
circle
with
a
radius
of
five
miles
round
the
woking
sand
pits
I
doubt
if
you
would
have
had
one
human
being
outside
it
unless
it
were
some
relation
of
stent
or
of
the
three
or
four
cyclists
or
london
people
lying
dead
on
the
common
whose
emotions
or
habits
were
at
all
affected
by
the
newcomers

many
people
had
heard
of
the
cylinder
of
course
and
talked
about
it
in
their
leisure
but
it
certainly
did
not
make
the
sensation
that
an
ultimatum
to
germany
would
have
done

in
london
that
night
poor
henderson's
telegram
describing
the
gradual
unscrewing
of
the
shot
was
judged
to
be
a
canard
and
his
evening
paper
after
wiring
for
authentication
from
him
and
receiving
no
replythe
man
was
killeddecided
not
to
print
a
special
edition

even
within
the
fivemile
circle
the
great
majority
of
people
were
inert

I
have
already
described
the
behaviour
of
the
men
and
women
to
whom
I
spoke

all
over
the
district
people
were
dining
and
supping
working
men
were
gardening
after
the
labours
of
the
day
children
were
being
put
to
bed
young
people
were
wandering
through
the
lanes
lovemaking
students
sat
over
their
books

maybe
there
was
a
murmur
in
the
village
streets
a
novel
and
dominant
topic
in
the
publichouses
and
here
and
there
a
messenger
or
even
an
eyewitness
of
the
later
occurrences
caused
a
whirl
of
excitement
a
shouting
and
a
running
to
and
fro
but
for
the
most
part
the
daily
routine
of
working
eating
drinking
sleeping
went
on
as
it
had
done
for
countless
yearsas
though
no
planet
mars
existed
in
the
sky

even
at
woking
station
and
horsell
and
chobham
that
was
the
case

in
woking
junction
until
a
late
hour
trains
were
stopping
and
going
on
others
were
shunting
on
the
sidings
passengers
were
alighting
and
waiting
and
everything
was
proceeding
in
the
most
ordinary
way

a
boy
from
the
town
trenching
on
smith's
monopoly
was
selling
papers
with
the
afternoon's
news

the
ringing
impact
of
trucks
the
sharp
whistle
of
the
engines
from
the
junction
mingled
with
their
shouts
of
men
from
mars

excited
men
came
into
the
station
about
nine
o'clock
with
incredible
tidings
and
caused
no
more
disturbance
than
drunkards
might
have
done

people
rattling
londonwards
peered
into
the
darkness
outside
the
carriage
windows
and
saw
only
a
rare
flickering
vanishing
spark
dance
up
from
the
direction
of
horsell
a
red
glow
and
a
thin
veil
of
smoke
driving
across
the
stars
and
thought
that
nothing
more
serious
than
a
heath
fire
was
happening

it
was
only
round
the
edge
of
the
common
that
any
disturbance
was
perceptible

there
were
half
a
dozen
villas
burning
on
the
woking
border

there
were
lights
in
all
the
houses
on
the
common
side
of
the
three
villages
and
the
people
there
kept
awake
till
dawn

a
curious
crowd
lingered
restlessly
people
coming
and
going
but
the
crowd
remaining
both
on
the
chobham
and
horsell
bridges

one
or
two
adventurous
souls
it
was
afterwards
found
went
into
the
darkness
and
crawled
quite
near
the
martians
but
they
never
returned
for
now
and
again
a
lightray
like
the
beam
of
a
warship's
searchlight
swept
the
common
and
the
heatray
was
ready
to
follow

save
for
such
that
big
area
of
common
was
silent
and
desolate
and
the
charred
bodies
lay
about
on
it
all
night
under
the
stars
and
all
the
next
day

a
noise
of
hammering
from
the
pit
was
heard
by
many
people

so
you
have
the
state
of
things
on
friday
night

in
the
centre
sticking
into
the
skin
of
our
old
planet
earth
like
a
poisoned
dart
was
this
cylinder

but
the
poison
was
scarcely
working
yet

around
it
was
a
patch
of
silent
common
smouldering
in
places
and
with
a
few
dark
dimly
seen
objects
lying
in
contorted
attitudes
here
and
there
here
and
there
was
a
burning
bush
or
tree

beyond
was
a
fringe
of
excitement
and
farther
than
that
fringe
the
inflammation
had
not
crept
as
yet

in
the
rest
of
the
world
the
stream
of
life
still
flowed
as
it
had
flowed
for
immemorial
years

the
fever
of
war
that
would
presently
clog
vein
and
artery
deaden
nerve
and
destroy
brain
had
still
to
develop

all
night
long
the
martians
were
hammering
and
stirring
sleepless
indefatigable
at
work
upon
the
machines
they
were
making
ready
and
ever
and
again
a
puff
of
greenishwhite
smoke
whirled
up
to
the
starlit
sky

about
eleven
a
company
of
soldiers
came
through
horsell
and
deployed
along
the
edge
of
the
common
to
form
a
cordon

later
a
second
company
marched
through
chobham
to
deploy
on
the
north
side
of
the
common

several
officers
from
the
inkerman
barracks
had
been
on
the
common
earlier
in
the
day
and
one
major
eden
was
reported
to
be
missing

the
colonel
of
the
regiment
came
to
the
chobham
bridge
and
was
busy
questioning
the
crowd
at
midnight

the
military
authorities
were
certainly
alive
to
the
seriousness
of
the
business

about
eleven
the
next
morning's
papers
were
able
to
say
a
squadron
of
hussars
two
maxims
and
about
four
hundred
men
of
the
cardigan
regiment
started
from
aldershot

a
few
seconds
after
midnight
the
crowd
in
the
chertsey
road
woking
saw
a
star
fall
from
heaven
into
the
pine
woods
to
the
northwest

it
had
a
greenish
colour
and
caused
a
silent
brightness
like
summer
lightning

this
was
the
second
cylinder



chapter
nine

the
fighting
begins


saturday
lives
in
my
memory
as
a
day
of
suspense

it
was
a
day
of
lassitude
too
hot
and
close
with
I
am
told
a
rapidly
fluctuating
barometer

I
had
slept
but
little
though
my
wife
had
succeeded
in
sleeping
and
I
rose
early

I
went
into
my
garden
before
breakfast
and
stood
listening
but
towards
the
common
there
was
nothing
stirring
but
a
lark

the
milkman
came
as
usual

I
heard
the
rattle
of
his
chariot
and
I
went
round
to
the
side
gate
to
ask
the
latest
news

he
told
me
that
during
the
night
the
martians
had
been
surrounded
by
troops
and
that
guns
were
expected

thena
familiar
reassuring
notei
heard
a
train
running
towards
woking

they
aren't
to
be
killed
said
the
milkman
if
that
can
possibly
be
avoided

I
saw
my
neighbour
gardening
chatted
with
him
for
a
time
and
then
strolled
in
to
breakfast

it
was
a
most
unexceptional
morning

my
neighbour
was
of
opinion
that
the
troops
would
be
able
to
capture
or
to
destroy
the
martians
during
the
day

it's
a
pity
they
make
themselves
so
unapproachable
he
said

it
would
be
curious
to
know
how
they
live
on
another
planet
we
might
learn
a
thing
or
two

he
came
up
to
the
fence
and
extended
a
handful
of
strawberries
for
his
gardening
was
as
generous
as
it
was
enthusiastic

at
the
same
time
he
told
me
of
the
burning
of
the
pine
woods
about
the
byfleet
golf
links

they
say
said
he
that
there's
another
of
those
blessed
things
fallen
therenumber
two

but
one's
enough
surely

this
lot'll
cost
the
insurance
people
a
pretty
penny
before
everything's
settled

he
laughed
with
an
air
of
the
greatest
good
humour
as
he
said
this

the
woods
he
said
were
still
burning
and
pointed
out
a
haze
of
smoke
to
me

they
will
be
hot
under
foot
for
days
on
account
of
the
thick
soil
of
pine
needles
and
turf
he
said
and
then
grew
serious
over
poor
ogilvy

after
breakfast
instead
of
working
I
decided
to
walk
down
towards
the
common

under
the
railway
bridge
I
found
a
group
of
soldierssappers
I
think
men
in
small
round
caps
dirty
red
jackets
unbuttoned
and
showing
their
blue
shirts
dark
trousers
and
boots
coming
to
the
calf

they
told
me
no
one
was
allowed
over
the
canal
and
looking
along
the
road
towards
the
bridge
I
saw
one
of
the
cardigan
men
standing
sentinel
there

I
talked
with
these
soldiers
for
a
time
I
told
them
of
my
sight
of
the
martians
on
the
previous
evening

none
of
them
had
seen
the
martians
and
they
had
but
the
vaguest
ideas
of
them
so
that
they
plied
me
with
questions

they
said
that
they
did
not
know
who
had
authorised
the
movements
of
the
troops
their
idea
was
that
a
dispute
had
arisen
at
the
horse
guards
the
ordinary
sapper
is
a
great
deal
better
educated
than
the
common
soldier
and
they
discussed
the
peculiar
conditions
of
the
possible
fight
with
some
acuteness

I
described
the
heatray
to
them
and
they
began
to
argue
among
themselves

crawl
up
under
cover
and
rush
'em
say
I
said
one

get
aht
said
another

what's
cover
against
this
'ere
'eat
sticks
to
cook
yer

what
we
got
to
do
is
to
go
as
near
as
the
ground'll
let
us
and
then
drive
a
trench

blow
yer
trenches

you
always
want
trenches
you
ought
to
ha'
been
born
a
rabbit
snippy

ain't
they
got
any
necks
then
said
a
third
abruptlya
little
contemplative
dark
man
smoking
a
pipe

I
repeated
my
description

octopuses
said
he
that's
what
I
calls
'em

talk
about
fishers
of
menfighters
of
fish
it
is
this
time

it
ain't
no
murder
killing
beasts
like
that
said
the
first
speaker

why
not
shell
the
darned
things
strite
off
and
finish
'em
said
the
little
dark
man

you
carn
tell
what
they
might
do

where's
your
shells
said
the
first
speaker

there
ain't
no
time

do
it
in
a
rush
that's
my
tip
and
do
it
at
once

so
they
discussed
it

after
a
while
I
left
them
and
went
on
to
the
railway
station
to
get
as
many
morning
papers
as
I
could

but
I
will
not
weary
the
reader
with
a
description
of
that
long
morning
and
of
the
longer
afternoon

I
did
not
succeed
in
getting
a
glimpse
of
the
common
for
even
horsell
and
chobham
church
towers
were
in
the
hands
of
the
military
authorities

the
soldiers
I
addressed
didn't
know
anything
the
officers
were
mysterious
as
well
as
busy

I
found
people
in
the
town
quite
secure
again
in
the
presence
of
the
military
and
I
heard
for
the
first
time
from
marshall
the
tobacconist
that
his
son
was
among
the
dead
on
the
common

the
soldiers
had
made
the
people
on
the
outskirts
of
horsell
lock
up
and
leave
their
houses

I
got
back
to
lunch
about
two
very
tired
for
as
I
have
said
the
day
was
extremely
hot
and
dull
and
in
order
to
refresh
myself
I
took
a
cold
bath
in
the
afternoon

about
half
past
four
I
went
up
to
the
railway
station
to
get
an
evening
paper
for
the
morning
papers
had
contained
only
a
very
inaccurate
description
of
the
killing
of
stent
henderson
ogilvy
and
the
others

but
there
was
little
I
didn't
know

the
martians
did
not
show
an
inch
of
themselves

they
seemed
busy
in
their
pit
and
there
was
a
sound
of
hammering
and
an
almost
continuous
streamer
of
smoke

apparently
they
were
busy
getting
ready
for
a
struggle

fresh
attempts
have
been
made
to
signal
but
without
success
was
the
stereotyped
formula
of
the
papers

a
sapper
told
me
it
was
done
by
a
man
in
a
ditch
with
a
flag
on
a
long
pole

the
martians
took
as
much
notice
of
such
advances
as
we
should
of
the
lowing
of
a
cow

I
must
confess
the
sight
of
all
this
armament
all
this
preparation
greatly
excited
me

my
imagination
became
belligerent
and
defeated
the
invaders
in
a
dozen
striking
ways
something
of
my
schoolboy
dreams
of
battle
and
heroism
came
back

it
hardly
seemed
a
fair
fight
to
me
at
that
time

they
seemed
very
helpless
in
that
pit
of
theirs

about
three
o'clock
there
began
the
thud
of
a
gun
at
measured
intervals
from
chertsey
or
addlestone

I
learned
that
the
smouldering
pine
wood
into
which
the
second
cylinder
had
fallen
was
being
shelled
in
the
hope
of
destroying
that
object
before
it
opened

it
was
only
about
five
however
that
a
field
gun
reached
chobham
for
use
against
the
first
body
of
martians

about
six
in
the
evening
as
I
sat
at
tea
with
my
wife
in
the
summerhouse
talking
vigorously
about
the
battle
that
was
lowering
upon
us
I
heard
a
muffled
detonation
from
the
common
and
immediately
after
a
gust
of
firing

close
on
the
heels
of
that
came
a
violent
rattling
crash
quite
close
to
us
that
shook
the
ground
and
starting
out
upon
the
lawn
I
saw
the
tops
of
the
trees
about
the
oriental
college
burst
into
smoky
red
flame
and
the
tower
of
the
little
church
beside
it
slide
down
into
ruin

the
pinnacle
of
the
mosque
had
vanished
and
the
roof
line
of
the
college
itself
looked
as
if
a
hundredton
gun
had
been
at
work
upon
it

one
of
our
chimneys
cracked
as
if
a
shot
had
hit
it
flew
and
a
piece
of
it
came
clattering
down
the
tiles
and
made
a
heap
of
broken
red
fragments
upon
the
flower
bed
by
my
study
window

I
and
my
wife
stood
amazed

then
I
realised
that
the
crest
of
maybury
hill
must
be
within
range
of
the
martians'
heatray
now
that
the
college
was
cleared
out
of
the
way

at
that
I
gripped
my
wife's
arm
and
without
ceremony
ran
her
out
into
the
road

then
I
fetched
out
the
servant
telling
her
I
would
go
upstairs
myself
for
the
box
she
was
clamouring
for

we
can't
possibly
stay
here
I
said
and
as
I
spoke
the
firing
reopened
for
a
moment
upon
the
common

but
where
are
we
to
go
said
my
wife
in
terror

I
thought
perplexed

then
I
remembered
her
cousins
at
leatherhead

leatherhead
I
shouted
above
the
sudden
noise

she
looked
away
from
me
downhill

the
people
were
coming
out
of
their
houses
astonished

how
are
we
to
get
to
leatherhead
she
said

down
the
hill
I
saw
a
bevy
of
hussars
ride
under
the
railway
bridge
three
galloped
through
the
open
gates
of
the
oriental
college
two
others
dismounted
and
began
running
from
house
to
house

the
sun
shining
through
the
smoke
that
drove
up
from
the
tops
of
the
trees
seemed
blood
red
and
threw
an
unfamiliar
lurid
light
upon
everything

stop
here
said
I
you
are
safe
here
and
I
started
off
at
once
for
the
spotted
dog
for
I
knew
the
landlord
had
a
horse
and
dog
cart
I
ran
for
I
perceived
that
in
a
moment
everyone
upon
this
side
of
the
hill
would
be
moving

I
found
him
in
his
bar
quite
unaware
of
what
was
going
on
behind
his
house

a
man
stood
with
his
back
to
me
talking
to
him

I
must
have
a
pound
said
the
landlord
and
i've
no
one
to
drive
it

i'll
give
you
two
said
I
over
the
stranger's
shoulder

what
for

and
i'll
bring
it
back
by
midnight
I
said

lord
said
the
landlord
what's
the
hurry

i'm
selling
my
bit
of
a
pig

two
pounds
and
you
bring
it
back

what's
going
on
now

I
explained
hastily
that
I
had
to
leave
my
home
and
so
secured
the
dog
cart

at
the
time
it
did
not
seem
to
me
nearly
so
urgent
that
the
landlord
should
leave
his

I
took
care
to
have
the
cart
there
and
then
drove
it
off
down
the
road
and
leaving
it
in
charge
of
my
wife
and
servant
rushed
into
my
house
and
packed
a
few
valuables
such
plate
as
we
had
and
so
forth

the
beech
trees
below
the
house
were
burning
while
I
did
this
and
the
palings
up
the
road
glowed
red
while
I
was
occupied
in
this
way
one
of
the
dismounted
hussars
came
running
up

he
was
going
from
house
to
house
warning
people
to
leave

he
was
going
on
as
I
came
out
of
my
front
door
lugging
my
treasures
done
up
in
a
tablecloth

I
shouted
after
him

what
news

he
turned
stared
bawled
something
about
crawling
out
in
a
thing
like
a
dish
cover
and
ran
on
to
the
gate
of
the
house
at
the
crest
a
sudden
whirl
of
black
smoke
driving
across
the
road
hid
him
for
a
moment

I
ran
to
my
neighbour's
door
and
rapped
to
satisfy
myself
of
what
I
already
knew
that
his
wife
had
gone
to
london
with
him
and
had
locked
up
their
house

I
went
in
again
according
to
my
promise
to
get
my
servant's
box
lugged
it
out
clapped
it
beside
her
on
the
tail
of
the
dog
cart
and
then
caught
the
reins
and
jumped
up
into
the
driver's
seat
beside
my
wife

in
another
moment
we
were
clear
of
the
smoke
and
noise
and
spanking
down
the
opposite
slope
of
maybury
hill
towards
old
woking

in
front
was
a
quiet
sunny
landscape
a
wheat
field
ahead
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
the
maybury
inn
with
its
swinging
sign

I
saw
the
doctor's
cart
ahead
of
me

at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
I
turned
my
head
to
look
at
the
hillside
I
was
leaving

thick
streamers
of
black
smoke
shot
with
threads
of
red
fire
were
driving
up
into
the
still
air
and
throwing
dark
shadows
upon
the
green
treetops
eastward

the
smoke
already
extended
far
away
to
the
east
and
westto
the
byfleet
pine
woods
eastward
and
to
woking
on
the
west

the
road
was
dotted
with
people
running
towards
us

and
very
faint
now
but
very
distinct
through
the
hot
quiet
air
one
heard
the
whirr
of
a
machinegun
that
was
presently
stilled
and
an
intermittent
cracking
of
rifles
apparently
the
martians
were
setting
fire
to
everything
within
range
of
their
heatray

I
am
not
an
expert
driver
and
I
had
immediately
to
turn
my
attention
to
the
horse

when
I
looked
back
again
the
second
hill
had
hidden
the
black
smoke

I
slashed
the
horse
with
the
whip
and
gave
him
a
loose
rein
until
woking
and
send
lay
between
us
and
that
quivering
tumult

I
overtook
and
passed
the
doctor
between
woking
and
send



chapter
ten

in
the
storm


leatherhead
is
about
twelve
miles
from
maybury
hill

the
scent
of
hay
was
in
the
air
through
the
lush
meadows
beyond
pyrford
and
the
hedges
on
either
side
were
sweet
and
gay
with
multitudes
of
dogroses
the
heavy
firing
that
had
broken
out
while
we
were
driving
down
maybury
hill
ceased
as
abruptly
as
it
began
leaving
the
evening
very
peaceful
and
still

we
got
to
leatherhead
without
misadventure
about
nine
o'clock
and
the
horse
had
an
hour's
rest
while
I
took
supper
with
my
cousins
and
commended
my
wife
to
their
care

my
wife
was
curiously
silent
throughout
the
drive
and
seemed
oppressed
with
forebodings
of
evil

I
talked
to
her
reassuringly
pointing
out
that
the
martians
were
tied
to
the
pit
by
sheer
heaviness
and
at
the
utmost
could
but
crawl
a
little
out
of
it
but
she
answered
only
in
monosyllables

had
it
not
been
for
my
promise
to
the
innkeeper
she
would
I
think
have
urged
me
to
stay
in
leatherhead
that
night

would
that
I
had

her
face
I
remember
was
very
white
as
we
parted

for
my
own
part
I
had
been
feverishly
excited
all
day

something
very
like
the
war
fever
that
occasionally
runs
through
a
civilised
community
had
got
into
my
blood
and
in
my
heart
I
was
not
so
very
sorry
that
I
had
to
return
to
maybury
that
night

I
was
even
afraid
that
that
last
fusillade
I
had
heard
might
mean
the
extermination
of
our
invaders
from
mars

I
can
best
express
my
state
of
mind
by
saying
that
I
wanted
to
be
in
at
the
death

it
was
nearly
eleven
when
I
started
to
return

the
night
was
unexpectedly
dark
to
me
walking
out
of
the
lighted
passage
of
my
cousins'
house
it
seemed
indeed
black
and
it
was
as
hot
and
close
as
the
day

overhead
the
clouds
were
driving
fast
albeit
not
a
breath
stirred
the
shrubs
about
us

my
cousins'
man
lit
both
lamps

happily
I
knew
the
road
intimately

my
wife
stood
in
the
light
of
the
doorway
and
watched
me
until
I
jumped
up
into
the
dog
cart

then
abruptly
she
turned
and
went
in
leaving
my
cousins
side
by
side
wishing
me
good
hap

I
was
a
little
depressed
at
first
with
the
contagion
of
my
wife's
fears
but
very
soon
my
thoughts
reverted
to
the
martians

at
that
time
I
was
absolutely
in
the
dark
as
to
the
course
of
the
evening's
fighting

I
did
not
know
even
the
circumstances
that
had
precipitated
the
conflict

as
I
came
through
ockham
for
that
was
the
way
I
returned
and
not
through
send
and
old
woking
I
saw
along
the
western
horizon
a
bloodred
glow
which
as
I
drew
nearer
crept
slowly
up
the
sky

the
driving
clouds
of
the
gathering
thunderstorm
mingled
there
with
masses
of
black
and
red
smoke

ripley
street
was
deserted
and
except
for
a
lighted
window
or
so
the
village
showed
not
a
sign
of
life
but
I
narrowly
escaped
an
accident
at
the
corner
of
the
road
to
pyrford
where
a
knot
of
people
stood
with
their
backs
to
me

they
said
nothing
to
me
as
I
passed

I
do
not
know
what
they
knew
of
the
things
happening
beyond
the
hill
nor
do
I
know
if
the
silent
houses
I
passed
on
my
way
were
sleeping
securely
or
deserted
and
empty
or
harassed
and
watching
against
the
terror
of
the
night

from
ripley
until
I
came
through
pyrford
I
was
in
the
valley
of
the
wey
and
the
red
glare
was
hidden
from
me

as
I
ascended
the
little
hill
beyond
pyrford
church
the
glare
came
into
view
again
and
the
trees
about
me
shivered
with
the
first
intimation
of
the
storm
that
was
upon
me

then
I
heard
midnight
pealing
out
from
pyrford
church
behind
me
and
then
came
the
silhouette
of
maybury
hill
with
its
treetops
and
roofs
black
and
sharp
against
the
red

even
as
I
beheld
this
a
lurid
green
glare
lit
the
road
about
me
and
showed
the
distant
woods
towards
addlestone

I
felt
a
tug
at
the
reins

I
saw
that
the
driving
clouds
had
been
pierced
as
it
were
by
a
thread
of
green
fire
suddenly
lighting
their
confusion
and
falling
into
the
field
to
my
left

it
was
the
third
falling
star

close
on
its
apparition
and
blindingly
violet
by
contrast
danced
out
the
first
lightning
of
the
gathering
storm
and
the
thunder
burst
like
a
rocket
overhead

the
horse
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
bolted

a
moderate
incline
runs
towards
the
foot
of
maybury
hill
and
down
this
we
clattered

once
the
lightning
had
begun
it
went
on
in
as
rapid
a
succession
of
flashes
as
I
have
ever
seen

the
thunderclaps
treading
one
on
the
heels
of
another
and
with
a
strange
crackling
accompaniment
sounded
more
like
the
working
of
a
gigantic
electric
machine
than
the
usual
detonating
reverberations

the
flickering
light
was
blinding
and
confusing
and
a
thin
hail
smote
gustily
at
my
face
as
I
drove
down
the
slope

at
first
I
regarded
little
but
the
road
before
me
and
then
abruptly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
something
that
was
moving
rapidly
down
the
opposite
slope
of
maybury
hill

at
first
I
took
it
for
the
wet
roof
of
a
house
but
one
flash
following
another
showed
it
to
be
in
swift
rolling
movement

it
was
an
elusive
visiona
moment
of
bewildering
darkness
and
then
in
a
flash
like
daylight
the
red
masses
of
the
orphanage
near
the
crest
of
the
hill
the
green
tops
of
the
pine
trees
and
this
problematical
object
came
out
clear
and
sharp
and
bright

and
this
thing
I
saw

how
can
I
describe
it

a
monstrous
tripod
higher
than
many
houses
striding
over
the
young
pine
trees
and
smashing
them
aside
in
its
career
a
walking
engine
of
glittering
metal
striding
now
across
the
heather
articulate
ropes
of
steel
dangling
from
it
and
the
clattering
tumult
of
its
passage
mingling
with
the
riot
of
the
thunder

a
flash
and
it
came
out
vividly
heeling
over
one
way
with
two
feet
in
the
air
to
vanish
and
reappear
almost
instantly
as
it
seemed
with
the
next
flash
a
hundred
yards
nearer

can
you
imagine
a
milking
stool
tilted
and
bowled
violently
along
the
ground

that
was
the
impression
those
instant
flashes
gave
but
instead
of
a
milking
stool
imagine
it
a
great
body
of
machinery
on
a
tripod
stand

then
suddenly
the
trees
in
the
pine
wood
ahead
of
me
were
parted
as
brittle
reeds
are
parted
by
a
man
thrusting
through
them
they
were
snapped
off
and
driven
headlong
and
a
second
huge
tripod
appeared
rushing
as
it
seemed
headlong
towards
me

and
I
was
galloping
hard
to
meet
it
at
the
sight
of
the
second
monster
my
nerve
went
altogether

not
stopping
to
look
again
I
wrenched
the
horse's
head
hard
round
to
the
right
and
in
another
moment
the
dog
cart
had
heeled
over
upon
the
horse
the
shafts
smashed
noisily
and
I
was
flung
sideways
and
fell
heavily
into
a
shallow
pool
of
water

I
crawled
out
almost
immediately
and
crouched
my
feet
still
in
the
water
under
a
clump
of
furze

the
horse
lay
motionless
his
neck
was
broken
poor
brute
and
by
the
lightning
flashes
I
saw
the
black
bulk
of
the
overturned
dog
cart
and
the
silhouette
of
the
wheel
still
spinning
slowly

in
another
moment
the
colossal
mechanism
went
striding
by
me
and
passed
uphill
towards
pyrford

seen
nearer
the
thing
was
incredibly
strange
for
it
was
no
mere
insensate
machine
driving
on
its
way

machine
it
was
with
a
ringing
metallic
pace
and
long
flexible
glittering
tentacles
one
of
which
gripped
a
young
pine
tree
swinging
and
rattling
about
its
strange
body

it
picked
its
road
as
it
went
striding
along
and
the
brazen
hood
that
surmounted
it
moved
to
and
fro
with
the
inevitable
suggestion
of
a
head
looking
about

behind
the
main
body
was
a
huge
mass
of
white
metal
like
a
gigantic
fisherman's
basket
and
puffs
of
green
smoke
squirted
out
from
the
joints
of
the
limbs
as
the
monster
swept
by
me

and
in
an
instant
it
was
gone

so
much
I
saw
then
all
vaguely
for
the
flickering
of
the
lightning
in
blinding
highlights
and
dense
black
shadows

as
it
passed
it
set
up
an
exultant
deafening
howl
that
drowned
the
thunderaloo

alooand
in
another
minute
it
was
with
its
companion
half
a
mile
away
stooping
over
something
in
the
field

I
have
no
doubt
this
thing
in
the
field
was
the
third
of
the
ten
cylinders
they
had
fired
at
us
from
mars

for
some
minutes
I
lay
there
in
the
rain
and
darkness
watching
by
the
intermittent
light
these
monstrous
beings
of
metal
moving
about
in
the
distance
over
the
hedge
tops

a
thin
hail
was
now
beginning
and
as
it
came
and
went
their
figures
grew
misty
and
then
flashed
into
clearness
again

now
and
then
came
a
gap
in
the
lightning
and
the
night
swallowed
them
up

I
was
soaked
with
hail
above
and
puddle
water
below

it
was
some
time
before
my
blank
astonishment
would
let
me
struggle
up
the
bank
to
a
drier
position
or
think
at
all
of
my
imminent
peril

not
far
from
me
was
a
little
oneroomed
squatter's
hut
of
wood
surrounded
by
a
patch
of
potato
garden

I
struggled
to
my
feet
at
last
and
crouching
and
making
use
of
every
chance
of
cover
I
made
a
run
for
this

I
hammered
at
the
door
but
I
could
not
make
the
people
hear
if
there
were
any
people
inside
and
after
a
time
I
desisted
and
availing
myself
of
a
ditch
for
the
greater
part
of
the
way
succeeded
in
crawling
unobserved
by
these
monstrous
machines
into
the
pine
woods
towards
maybury

under
cover
of
this
I
pushed
on
wet
and
shivering
now
towards
my
own
house

I
walked
among
the
trees
trying
to
find
the
footpath

it
was
very
dark
indeed
in
the
wood
for
the
lightning
was
now
becoming
infrequent
and
the
hail
which
was
pouring
down
in
a
torrent
fell
in
columns
through
the
gaps
in
the
heavy
foliage

if
I
had
fully
realised
the
meaning
of
all
the
things
I
had
seen
I
should
have
immediately
worked
my
way
round
through
byfleet
to
street
cobham
and
so
gone
back
to
rejoin
my
wife
at
leatherhead

but
that
night
the
strangeness
of
things
about
me
and
my
physical
wretchedness
prevented
me
for
I
was
bruised
weary
wet
to
the
skin
deafened
and
blinded
by
the
storm

I
had
a
vague
idea
of
going
on
to
my
own
house
and
that
was
as
much
motive
as
I
had

I
staggered
through
the
trees
fell
into
a
ditch
and
bruised
my
knees
against
a
plank
and
finally
splashed
out
into
the
lane
that
ran
down
from
the
college
arms

I
say
splashed
for
the
storm
water
was
sweeping
the
sand
down
the
hill
in
a
muddy
torrent

there
in
the
darkness
a
man
blundered
into
me
and
sent
me
reeling
back

he
gave
a
cry
of
terror
sprang
sideways
and
rushed
on
before
I
could
gather
my
wits
sufficiently
to
speak
to
him

so
heavy
was
the
stress
of
the
storm
just
at
this
place
that
I
had
the
hardest
task
to
win
my
way
up
the
hill

I
went
close
up
to
the
fence
on
the
left
and
worked
my
way
along
its
palings

near
the
top
I
stumbled
upon
something
soft
and
by
a
flash
of
lightning
saw
between
my
feet
a
heap
of
black
broadcloth
and
a
pair
of
boots

before
I
could
distinguish
clearly
how
the
man
lay
the
flicker
of
light
had
passed

I
stood
over
him
waiting
for
the
next
flash

when
it
came
I
saw
that
he
was
a
sturdy
man
cheaply
but
not
shabbily
dressed
his
head
was
bent
under
his
body
and
he
lay
crumpled
up
close
to
the
fence
as
though
he
had
been
flung
violently
against
it

overcoming
the
repugnance
natural
to
one
who
had
never
before
touched
a
dead
body
I
stooped
and
turned
him
over
to
feel
for
his
heart

he
was
quite
dead

apparently
his
neck
had
been
broken

the
lightning
flashed
for
a
third
time
and
his
face
leaped
upon
me

I
sprang
to
my
feet

it
was
the
landlord
of
the
spotted
dog
whose
conveyance
I
had
taken

I
stepped
over
him
gingerly
and
pushed
on
up
the
hill

I
made
my
way
by
the
police
station
and
the
college
arms
towards
my
own
house
nothing
was
burning
on
the
hillside
though
from
the
common
there
still
came
a
red
glare
and
a
rolling
tumult
of
ruddy
smoke
beating
up
against
the
drenching
hail

so
far
as
I
could
see
by
the
flashes
the
houses
about
me
were
mostly
uninjured

by
the
college
arms
a
dark
heap
lay
in
the
road

down
the
road
towards
maybury
bridge
there
were
voices
and
the
sound
of
feet
but
I
had
not
the
courage
to
shout
or
to
go
to
them

I
let
myself
in
with
my
latchkey
closed
locked
and
bolted
the
door
staggered
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
sat
down

my
imagination
was
full
of
those
striding
metallic
monsters
and
of
the
dead
body
smashed
against
the
fence

I
crouched
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
with
my
back
to
the
wall
shivering
violently



chapter
eleven

at
the
window


I
have
already
said
that
my
storms
of
emotion
have
a
trick
of
exhausting
themselves

after
a
time
I
discovered
that
I
was
cold
and
wet
and
with
little
pools
of
water
about
me
on
the
stair
carpet

I
got
up
almost
mechanically
went
into
the
dining
room
and
drank
some
whiskey
and
then
I
was
moved
to
change
my
clothes

after
I
had
done
that
I
went
upstairs
to
my
study
but
why
I
did
so
I
do
not
know

the
window
of
my
study
looks
over
the
trees
and
the
railway
towards
horsell
common

in
the
hurry
of
our
departure
this
window
had
been
left
open

the
passage
was
dark
and
by
contrast
with
the
picture
the
window
frame
enclosed
the
side
of
the
room
seemed
impenetrably
dark

I
stopped
short
in
the
doorway

the
thunderstorm
had
passed

the
towers
of
the
oriental
college
and
the
pine
trees
about
it
had
gone
and
very
far
away
lit
by
a
vivid
red
glare
the
common
about
the
sand
pits
was
visible

across
the
light
huge
black
shapes
grotesque
and
strange
moved
busily
to
and
fro

it
seemed
indeed
as
if
the
whole
country
in
that
direction
was
on
firea
broad
hillside
set
with
minute
tongues
of
flame
swaying
and
writhing
with
the
gusts
of
the
dying
storm
and
throwing
a
red
reflection
upon
the
cloudscud
above

every
now
and
then
a
haze
of
smoke
from
some
nearer
conflagration
drove
across
the
window
and
hid
the
martian
shapes

I
could
not
see
what
they
were
doing
nor
the
clear
form
of
them
nor
recognise
the
black
objects
they
were
busied
upon

neither
could
I
see
the
nearer
fire
though
the
reflections
of
it
danced
on
the
wall
and
ceiling
of
the
study

a
sharp
resinous
tang
of
burning
was
in
the
air

I
closed
the
door
noiselessly
and
crept
towards
the
window

as
I
did
so
the
view
opened
out
until
on
the
one
hand
it
reached
to
the
houses
about
woking
station
and
on
the
other
to
the
charred
and
blackened
pine
woods
of
byfleet

there
was
a
light
down
below
the
hill
on
the
railway
near
the
arch
and
several
of
the
houses
along
the
maybury
road
and
the
streets
near
the
station
were
glowing
ruins
the
light
upon
the
railway
puzzled
me
at
first
there
were
a
black
heap
and
a
vivid
glare
and
to
the
right
of
that
a
row
of
yellow
oblongs

then
I
perceived
this
was
a
wrecked
train
the
fore
part
smashed
and
on
fire
the
hinder
carriages
still
upon
the
rails

between
these
three
main
centres
of
lightthe
houses
the
train
and
the
burning
county
towards
chobhamstretched
irregular
patches
of
dark
country
broken
here
and
there
by
intervals
of
dimly
glowing
and
smoking
ground

it
was
the
strangest
spectacle
that
black
expanse
set
with
fire

it
reminded
me
more
than
anything
else
of
the
potteries
at
night

at
first
I
could
distinguish
no
people
at
all
though
I
peered
intently
for
them

later
I
saw
against
the
light
of
woking
station
a
number
of
black
figures
hurrying
one
after
the
other
across
the
line

and
this
was
the
little
world
in
which
I
had
been
living
securely
for
years
this
fiery
chaos

what
had
happened
in
the
last
seven
hours
I
still
did
not
know
nor
did
I
know
though
I
was
beginning
to
guess
the
relation
between
these
mechanical
colossi
and
the
sluggish
lumps
I
had
seen
disgorged
from
the
cylinder

with
a
queer
feeling
of
impersonal
interest
I
turned
my
desk
chair
to
the
window
sat
down
and
stared
at
the
blackened
country
and
particularly
at
the
three
gigantic
black
things
that
were
going
to
and
fro
in
the
glare
about
the
sand
pits

they
seemed
amazingly
busy

I
began
to
ask
myself
what
they
could
be

were
they
intelligent
mechanisms

such
a
thing
I
felt
was
impossible

or
did
a
martian
sit
within
each
ruling
directing
using
much
as
a
man's
brain
sits
and
rules
in
his
body

I
began
to
compare
the
things
to
human
machines
to
ask
myself
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
how
an
ironclad
or
a
steam
engine
would
seem
to
an
intelligent
lower
animal

the
storm
had
left
the
sky
clear
and
over
the
smoke
of
the
burning
land
the
little
fading
pinpoint
of
mars
was
dropping
into
the
west
when
a
soldier
came
into
my
garden

I
heard
a
slight
scraping
at
the
fence
and
rousing
myself
from
the
lethargy
that
had
fallen
upon
me
I
looked
down
and
saw
him
dimly
clambering
over
the
palings

at
the
sight
of
another
human
being
my
torpor
passed
and
I
leaned
out
of
the
window
eagerly

hist
said
I
in
a
whisper

he
stopped
astride
of
the
fence
in
doubt

then
he
came
over
and
across
the
lawn
to
the
corner
of
the
house

he
bent
down
and
stepped
softly

who's
there
he
said
also
whispering
standing
under
the
window
and
peering
up

where
are
you
going
I
asked

god
knows

are
you
trying
to
hide

that's
it

come
into
the
house
I
said

I
went
down
unfastened
the
door
and
let
him
in
and
locked
the
door
again

I
could
not
see
his
face

he
was
hatless
and
his
coat
was
unbuttoned

my
god
he
said
as
I
drew
him
in

what
has
happened
I
asked

what
hasn't

in
the
obscurity
I
could
see
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair

they
wiped
us
outsimply
wiped
us
out
he
repeated
again
and
again

he
followed
me
almost
mechanically
into
the
dining
room

take
some
whiskey
I
said
pouring
out
a
stiff
dose

he
drank
it

then
abruptly
he
sat
down
before
the
table
put
his
head
on
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
and
weep
like
a
little
boy
in
a
perfect
passion
of
emotion
while
I
with
a
curious
forgetfulness
of
my
own
recent
despair
stood
beside
him
wondering

it
was
a
long
time
before
he
could
steady
his
nerves
to
answer
my
questions
and
then
he
answered
perplexingly
and
brokenly

he
was
a
driver
in
the
artillery
and
had
only
come
into
action
about
seven

at
that
time
firing
was
going
on
across
the
common
and
it
was
said
the
first
party
of
martians
were
crawling
slowly
towards
their
second
cylinder
under
cover
of
a
metal
shield

later
this
shield
staggered
up
on
tripod
legs
and
became
the
first
of
the
fightingmachines
I
had
seen

the
gun
he
drove
had
been
unlimbered
near
horsell
in
order
to
command
the
sand
pits
and
its
arrival
it
was
that
had
precipitated
the
action

as
the
limber
gunners
went
to
the
rear
his
horse
trod
in
a
rabbit
hole
and
came
down
throwing
him
into
a
depression
of
the
ground

at
the
same
moment
the
gun
exploded
behind
him
the
ammunition
blew
up
there
was
fire
all
about
him
and
he
found
himself
lying
under
a
heap
of
charred
dead
men
and
dead
horses

I
lay
still
he
said
scared
out
of
my
wits
with
the
fore
quarter
of
a
horse
atop
of
me

we'd
been
wiped
out

and
the
smellgood
god

like
burnt
meat

I
was
hurt
across
the
back
by
the
fall
of
the
horse
and
there
I
had
to
lie
until
I
felt
better

just
like
parade
it
had
been
a
minute
beforethen
stumble
bang
swish

wiped
out
he
said

he
had
hid
under
the
dead
horse
for
a
long
time
peeping
out
furtively
across
the
common

the
cardigan
men
had
tried
a
rush
in
skirmishing
order
at
the
pit
simply
to
be
swept
out
of
existence
then
the
monster
had
risen
to
its
feet
and
had
begun
to
walk
leisurely
to
and
fro
across
the
common
among
the
few
fugitives
with
its
headlike
hood
turning
about
exactly
like
the
head
of
a
cowled
human
being

a
kind
of
arm
carried
a
complicated
metallic
case
about
which
green
flashes
scintillated
and
out
of
the
funnel
of
this
there
smoked
the
heatray

in
a
few
minutes
there
was
so
far
as
the
soldier
could
see
not
a
living
thing
left
upon
the
common
and
every
bush
and
tree
upon
it
that
was
not
already
a
blackened
skeleton
was
burning

the
hussars
had
been
on
the
road
beyond
the
curvature
of
the
ground
and
he
saw
nothing
of
them

he
heard
the
martians
rattle
for
a
time
and
then
become
still

the
giant
saved
woking
station
and
its
cluster
of
houses
until
the
last
then
in
a
moment
the
heatray
was
brought
to
bear
and
the
town
became
a
heap
of
fiery
ruins

then
the
thing
shut
off
the
heatray
and
turning
its
back
upon
the
artilleryman
began
to
waddle
away
towards
the
smouldering
pine
woods
that
sheltered
the
second
cylinder

as
it
did
so
a
second
glittering
titan
built
itself
up
out
of
the
pit

the
second
monster
followed
the
first
and
at
that
the
artilleryman
began
to
crawl
very
cautiously
across
the
hot
heather
ash
towards
horsell

he
managed
to
get
alive
into
the
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
so
escaped
to
woking

there
his
story
became
ejaculatory
the
place
was
impassable

it
seems
there
were
a
few
people
alive
there
frantic
for
the
most
part
and
many
burned
and
scalded

he
was
turned
aside
by
the
fire
and
hid
among
some
almost
scorching
heaps
of
broken
wall
as
one
of
the
martian
giants
returned

he
saw
this
one
pursue
a
man
catch
him
up
in
one
of
its
steely
tentacles
and
knock
his
head
against
the
trunk
of
a
pine
tree

at
last
after
nightfall
the
artilleryman
made
a
rush
for
it
and
got
over
the
railway
embankment

since
then
he
had
been
skulking
along
towards
maybury
in
the
hope
of
getting
out
of
danger
londonward

people
were
hiding
in
trenches
and
cellars
and
many
of
the
survivors
had
made
off
towards
woking
village
and
send

he
had
been
consumed
with
thirst
until
he
found
one
of
the
water
mains
near
the
railway
arch
smashed
and
the
water
bubbling
out
like
a
spring
upon
the
road

that
was
the
story
I
got
from
him
bit
by
bit

he
grew
calmer
telling
me
and
trying
to
make
me
see
the
things
he
had
seen

he
had
eaten
no
food
since
midday
he
told
me
early
in
his
narrative
and
I
found
some
mutton
and
bread
in
the
pantry
and
brought
it
into
the
room

we
lit
no
lamp
for
fear
of
attracting
the
martians
and
ever
and
again
our
hands
would
touch
upon
bread
or
meat

as
he
talked
things
about
us
came
darkly
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
trampled
bushes
and
broken
rose
trees
outside
the
window
grew
distinct

it
would
seem
that
a
number
of
men
or
animals
had
rushed
across
the
lawn
I
began
to
see
his
face
blackened
and
haggard
as
no
doubt
mine
was
also

when
we
had
finished
eating
we
went
softly
upstairs
to
my
study
and
I
looked
again
out
of
the
open
window

in
one
night
the
valley
had
become
a
valley
of
ashes

the
fires
had
dwindled
now

where
flames
had
been
there
were
now
streamers
of
smoke
but
the
countless
ruins
of
shattered
and
gutted
houses
and
blasted
and
blackened
trees
that
the
night
had
hidden
stood
out
now
gaunt
and
terrible
in
the
pitiless
light
of
dawn

yet
here
and
there
some
object
had
had
the
luck
to
escapea
white
railway
signal
here
the
end
of
a
greenhouse
there
white
and
fresh
amid
the
wreckage

never
before
in
the
history
of
warfare
had
destruction
been
so
indiscriminate
and
so
universal
and
shining
with
the
growing
light
of
the
east
three
of
the
metallic
giants
stood
about
the
pit
their
cowls
rotating
as
though
they
were
surveying
the
desolation
they
had
made

it
seemed
to
me
that
the
pit
had
been
enlarged
and
ever
and
again
puffs
of
vivid
green
vapour
streamed
up
and
out
of
it
towards
the
brightening
dawnstreamed
up
whirled
broke
and
vanished

beyond
were
the
pillars
of
fire
about
chobham

they
became
pillars
of
bloodshot
smoke
at
the
first
touch
of
day



chapter
twelve

what
I
saw
of
the
destruction
of
weybridge
and
shepperton


as
the
dawn
grew
brighter
we
withdrew
from
the
window
from
which
we
had
watched
the
martians
and
went
very
quietly
downstairs

the
artilleryman
agreed
with
me
that
the
house
was
no
place
to
stay
in

he
proposed
he
said
to
make
his
way
londonward
and
thence
rejoin
his
batteryno
12
of
the
horse
artillery

my
plan
was
to
return
at
once
to
leatherhead
and
so
greatly
had
the
strength
of
the
martians
impressed
me
that
I
had
determined
to
take
my
wife
to
newhaven
and
go
with
her
out
of
the
country
forthwith

for
I
already
perceived
clearly
that
the
country
about
london
must
inevitably
be
the
scene
of
a
disastrous
struggle
before
such
creatures
as
these
could
be
destroyed

between
us
and
leatherhead
however
lay
the
third
cylinder
with
its
guarding
giants

had
I
been
alone
I
think
I
should
have
taken
my
chance
and
struck
across
country

but
the
artilleryman
dissuaded
me
it's
no
kindness
to
the
right
sort
of
wife
he
said
to
make
her
a
widow
and
in
the
end
I
agreed
to
go
with
him
under
cover
of
the
woods
northward
as
far
as
street
cobham
before
I
parted
with
him
thence
I
would
make
a
big
detour
by
epsom
to
reach
leatherhead

I
should
have
started
at
once
but
my
companion
had
been
in
active
service
and
he
knew
better
than
that

he
made
me
ransack
the
house
for
a
flask
which
he
filled
with
whiskey
and
we
lined
every
available
pocket
with
packets
of
biscuits
and
slices
of
meat

then
we
crept
out
of
the
house
and
ran
as
quickly
as
we
could
down
the
illmade
road
by
which
I
had
come
overnight

the
houses
seemed
deserted
in
the
road
lay
a
group
of
three
charred
bodies
close
together
struck
dead
by
the
heatray
and
here
and
there
were
things
that
people
had
droppeda
clock
a
slipper
a
silver
spoon
and
the
like
poor
valuables

at
the
corner
turning
up
towards
the
post
office
a
little
cart
filled
with
boxes
and
furniture
and
horseless
heeled
over
on
a
broken
wheel

a
cash
box
had
been
hastily
smashed
open
and
thrown
under
the
debris

except
the
lodge
at
the
orphanage
which
was
still
on
fire
none
of
the
houses
had
suffered
very
greatly
here

the
heatray
had
shaved
the
chimney
tops
and
passed

yet
save
ourselves
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
living
soul
on
maybury
hill

the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
had
escaped
I
suppose
by
way
of
the
old
woking
roadthe
road
I
had
taken
when
I
drove
to
leatherheador
they
had
hidden

we
went
down
the
lane
by
the
body
of
the
man
in
black
sodden
now
from
the
overnight
hail
and
broke
into
the
woods
at
the
foot
of
the
hill

we
pushed
through
these
towards
the
railway
without
meeting
a
soul

the
woods
across
the
line
were
but
the
scarred
and
blackened
ruins
of
woods
for
the
most
part
the
trees
had
fallen
but
a
certain
proportion
still
stood
dismal
grey
stems
with
dark
brown
foliage
instead
of
green

on
our
side
the
fire
had
done
no
more
than
scorch
the
nearer
trees
it
had
failed
to
secure
its
footing

in
one
place
the
woodmen
had
been
at
work
on
saturday
trees
felled
and
freshly
trimmed
lay
in
a
clearing
with
heaps
of
sawdust
by
the
sawingmachine
and
its
engine
hard
by
was
a
temporary
hut
deserted

there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
this
morning
and
everything
was
strangely
still

even
the
birds
were
hushed
and
as
we
hurried
along
I
and
the
artilleryman
talked
in
whispers
and
looked
now
and
again
over
our
shoulders

once
or
twice
we
stopped
to
listen

after
a
time
we
drew
near
the
road
and
as
we
did
so
we
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
saw
through
the
tree
stems
three
cavalry
soldiers
riding
slowly
towards
woking

we
hailed
them
and
they
halted
while
we
hurried
towards
them

it
was
a
lieutenant
and
a
couple
of
privates
of
the
8th
hussars
with
a
stand
like
a
theodolite
which
the
artilleryman
told
me
was
a
heliograph

you
are
the
first
men
i've
seen
coming
this
way
this
morning
said
the
lieutenant

what's
brewing

his
voice
and
face
were
eager

the
men
behind
him
stared
curiously

the
artilleryman
jumped
down
the
bank
into
the
road
and
saluted

gun
destroyed
last
night
sir

have
been
hiding

trying
to
rejoin
battery
sir

you'll
come
in
sight
of
the
martians
I
expect
about
half
a
mile
along
this
road

what
the
dickens
are
they
like
asked
the
lieutenant

giants
in
armour
sir

hundred
feet
high

three
legs
and
a
body
like
'luminium
with
a
mighty
great
head
in
a
hood
sir

get
out
said
the
lieutenant

what
confounded
nonsense

you'll
see
sir

they
carry
a
kind
of
box
sir
that
shoots
fire
and
strikes
you
dead

what
d'ye
meana
gun

no
sir
and
the
artilleryman
began
a
vivid
account
of
the
heatray
halfway
through
the
lieutenant
interrupted
him
and
looked
up
at
me

I
was
still
standing
on
the
bank
by
the
side
of
the
road

it's
perfectly
true
I
said

well
said
the
lieutenant
I
suppose
it's
my
business
to
see
it
too

look
hereto
the
artillerymanwe're
detailed
here
clearing
people
out
of
their
houses

you'd
better
go
along
and
report
yourself
to
brigadiergeneral
marvin
and
tell
him
all
you
know

he's
at
weybridge

know
the
way

I
do
I
said
and
he
turned
his
horse
southward
again

half
a
mile
you
say
said
he

at
most
I
answered
and
pointed
over
the
treetops
southward

he
thanked
me
and
rode
on
and
we
saw
them
no
more

farther
along
we
came
upon
a
group
of
three
women
and
two
children
in
the
road
busy
clearing
out
a
labourer's
cottage

they
had
got
hold
of
a
little
hand
truck
and
were
piling
it
up
with
uncleanlooking
bundles
and
shabby
furniture

they
were
all
too
assiduously
engaged
to
talk
to
us
as
we
passed

by
byfleet
station
we
emerged
from
the
pine
trees
and
found
the
country
calm
and
peaceful
under
the
morning
sunlight

we
were
far
beyond
the
range
of
the
heatray
there
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
silent
desertion
of
some
of
the
houses
the
stirring
movement
of
packing
in
others
and
the
knot
of
soldiers
standing
on
the
bridge
over
the
railway
and
staring
down
the
line
towards
woking
the
day
would
have
seemed
very
like
any
other
sunday

several
farm
waggons
and
carts
were
moving
creakily
along
the
road
to
addlestone
and
suddenly
through
the
gate
of
a
field
we
saw
across
a
stretch
of
flat
meadow
six
twelvepounders
standing
neatly
at
equal
distances
pointing
towards
woking

the
gunners
stood
by
the
guns
waiting
and
the
ammunition
waggons
were
at
a
businesslike
distance
the
men
stood
almost
as
if
under
inspection

that's
good
said
I

they
will
get
one
fair
shot
at
any
rate

the
artilleryman
hesitated
at
the
gate

I
shall
go
on
he
said

farther
on
towards
weybridge
just
over
the
bridge
there
were
a
number
of
men
in
white
fatigue
jackets
throwing
up
a
long
rampart
and
more
guns
behind

it's
bows
and
arrows
against
the
lightning
anyhow
said
the
artilleryman

they
'aven't
seen
that
firebeam
yet

the
officers
who
were
not
actively
engaged
stood
and
stared
over
the
treetops
southwestward
and
the
men
digging
would
stop
every
now
and
again
to
stare
in
the
same
direction

byfleet
was
in
a
tumult
people
packing
and
a
score
of
hussars
some
of
them
dismounted
some
on
horseback
were
hunting
them
about
three
or
four
black
government
waggons
with
crosses
in
white
circles
and
an
old
omnibus
among
other
vehicles
were
being
loaded
in
the
village
street

there
were
scores
of
people
most
of
them
sufficiently
sabbatical
to
have
assumed
their
best
clothes

the
soldiers
were
having
the
greatest
difficulty
in
making
them
realise
the
gravity
of
their
position

we
saw
one
shrivelled
old
fellow
with
a
huge
box
and
a
score
or
more
of
flower
pots
containing
orchids
angrily
expostulating
with
the
corporal
who
would
leave
them
behind
I
stopped
and
gripped
his
arm

do
you
know
what's
over
there
I
said
pointing
at
the
pine
tops
that
hid
the
martians

eh
said
he
turning

I
was
explainin'
these
is
vallyble

death
I
shouted

death
is
coming

death
and
leaving
him
to
digest
that
if
he
could
I
hurried
on
after
the
artilleryman

at
the
corner
I
looked
back

the
soldier
had
left
him
and
he
was
still
standing
by
his
box
with
the
pots
of
orchids
on
the
lid
of
it
and
staring
vaguely
over
the
trees

no
one
in
weybridge
could
tell
us
where
the
headquarters
were
established
the
whole
place
was
in
such
confusion
as
I
had
never
seen
in
any
town
before

carts
carriages
everywhere
the
most
astonishing
miscellany
of
conveyances
and
horseflesh

the
respectable
inhabitants
of
the
place
men
in
golf
and
boating
costumes
wives
prettily
dressed
were
packing
riverside
loafers
energetically
helping
children
excited
and
for
the
most
part
highly
delighted
at
this
astonishing
variation
of
their
sunday
experiences

in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
worthy
vicar
was
very
pluckily
holding
an
early
celebration
and
his
bell
was
jangling
out
above
the
excitement

I
and
the
artilleryman
seated
on
the
step
of
the
drinking
fountain
made
a
very
passable
meal
upon
what
we
had
brought
with
us
patrols
of
soldiershere
no
longer
hussars
but
grenadiers
in
whitewere
warning
people
to
move
now
or
to
take
refuge
in
their
cellars
as
soon
as
the
firing
began

we
saw
as
we
crossed
the
railway
bridge
that
a
growing
crowd
of
people
had
assembled
in
and
about
the
railway
station
and
the
swarming
platform
was
piled
with
boxes
and
packages
the
ordinary
traffic
had
been
stopped
I
believe
in
order
to
allow
of
the
passage
of
troops
and
guns
to
chertsey
and
I
have
heard
since
that
a
savage
struggle
occurred
for
places
in
the
special
trains
that
were
put
on
at
a
later
hour

we
remained
at
weybridge
until
midday
and
at
that
hour
we
found
ourselves
at
the
place
near
shepperton
lock
where
the
wey
and
thames
join

part
of
the
time
we
spent
helping
two
old
women
to
pack
a
little
cart

the
wey
has
a
treble
mouth
and
at
this
point
boats
are
to
be
hired
and
there
was
a
ferry
across
the
river

on
the
shepperton
side
was
an
inn
with
a
lawn
and
beyond
that
the
tower
of
shepperton
churchit
has
been
replaced
by
a
spirerose
above
the
trees

here
we
found
an
excited
and
noisy
crowd
of
fugitives

as
yet
the
flight
had
not
grown
to
a
panic
but
there
were
already
far
more
people
than
all
the
boats
going
to
and
fro
could
enable
to
cross
people
came
panting
along
under
heavy
burdens
one
husband
and
wife
were
even
carrying
a
small
outhouse
door
between
them
with
some
of
their
household
goods
piled
thereon

one
man
told
us
he
meant
to
try
to
get
away
from
shepperton
station

there
was
a
lot
of
shouting
and
one
man
was
even
jesting

the
idea
people
seemed
to
have
here
was
that
the
martians
were
simply
formidable
human
beings
who
might
attack
and
sack
the
town
to
be
certainly
destroyed
in
the
end

every
now
and
then
people
would
glance
nervously
across
the
wey
at
the
meadows
towards
chertsey
but
everything
over
there
was
still

across
the
thames
except
just
where
the
boats
landed
everything
was
quiet
in
vivid
contrast
with
the
surrey
side

the
people
who
landed
there
from
the
boats
went
tramping
off
down
the
lane

the
big
ferryboat
had
just
made
a
journey

three
or
four
soldiers
stood
on
the
lawn
of
the
inn
staring
and
jesting
at
the
fugitives
without
offering
to
help

the
inn
was
closed
as
it
was
now
within
prohibited
hours

what's
that
cried
a
boatman
and
shut
up
you
fool
said
a
man
near
me
to
a
yelping
dog

then
the
sound
came
again
this
time
from
the
direction
of
chertsey
a
muffled
thudthe
sound
of
a
gun

the
fighting
was
beginning

almost
immediately
unseen
batteries
across
the
river
to
our
right
unseen
because
of
the
trees
took
up
the
chorus
firing
heavily
one
after
the
other

a
woman
screamed
everyone
stood
arrested
by
the
sudden
stir
of
battle
near
us
and
yet
invisible
to
us

nothing
was
to
be
seen
save
flat
meadows
cows
feeding
unconcernedly
for
the
most
part
and
silvery
pollard
willows
motionless
in
the
warm
sunlight

the
sojers'll
stop
'em
said
a
woman
beside
me
doubtfully

a
haziness
rose
over
the
treetops

then
suddenly
we
saw
a
rush
of
smoke
far
away
up
the
river
a
puff
of
smoke
that
jerked
up
into
the
air
and
hung
and
forthwith
the
ground
heaved
under
foot
and
a
heavy
explosion
shook
the
air
smashing
two
or
three
windows
in
the
houses
near
and
leaving
us
astonished

here
they
are
shouted
a
man
in
a
blue
jersey

yonder
d'yer
see
them

yonder

quickly
one
after
the
other
one
two
three
four
of
the
armoured
martians
appeared
far
away
over
the
little
trees
across
the
flat
meadows
that
stretched
towards
chertsey
and
striding
hurriedly
towards
the
river

little
cowled
figures
they
seemed
at
first
going
with
a
rolling
motion
and
as
fast
as
flying
birds

then
advancing
obliquely
towards
us
came
a
fifth

their
armoured
bodies
glittered
in
the
sun
as
they
swept
swiftly
forward
upon
the
guns
growing
rapidly
larger
as
they
drew
nearer

one
on
the
extreme
left
the
remotest
that
is
flourished
a
huge
case
high
in
the
air
and
the
ghostly
terrible
heatray
I
had
already
seen
on
friday
night
smote
towards
chertsey
and
struck
the
town

at
sight
of
these
strange
swift
and
terrible
creatures
the
crowd
near
the
water's
edge
seemed
to
me
to
be
for
a
moment
horrorstruck
there
was
no
screaming
or
shouting
but
a
silence

then
a
hoarse
murmur
and
a
movement
of
feeta
splashing
from
the
water

a
man
too
frightened
to
drop
the
portmanteau
he
carried
on
his
shoulder
swung
round
and
sent
me
staggering
with
a
blow
from
the
corner
of
his
burden

a
woman
thrust
at
me
with
her
hand
and
rushed
past
me

I
turned
with
the
rush
of
the
people
but
I
was
not
too
terrified
for
thought

the
terrible
heatray
was
in
my
mind

to
get
under
water
that
was
it

get
under
water
I
shouted
unheeded

I
faced
about
again
and
rushed
towards
the
approaching
martian
rushed
right
down
the
gravelly
beach
and
headlong
into
the
water
others
did
the
same

a
boatload
of
people
putting
back
came
leaping
out
as
I
rushed
past

the
stones
under
my
feet
were
muddy
and
slippery
and
the
river
was
so
low
that
I
ran
perhaps
twenty
feet
scarcely
waistdeep

then
as
the
martian
towered
overhead
scarcely
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
I
flung
myself
forward
under
the
surface

the
splashes
of
the
people
in
the
boats
leaping
into
the
river
sounded
like
thunderclaps
in
my
ears

people
were
landing
hastily
on
both
sides
of
the
river

but
the
martian
machine
took
no
more
notice
for
the
moment
of
the
people
running
this
way
and
that
than
a
man
would
of
the
confusion
of
ants
in
a
nest
against
which
his
foot
has
kicked

when
half
suffocated
I
raised
my
head
above
water
the
martian's
hood
pointed
at
the
batteries
that
were
still
firing
across
the
river
and
as
it
advanced
it
swung
loose
what
must
have
been
the
generator
of
the
heatray

in
another
moment
it
was
on
the
bank
and
in
a
stride
wading
halfway
across

the
knees
of
its
foremost
legs
bent
at
the
farther
bank
and
in
another
moment
it
had
raised
itself
to
its
full
height
again
close
to
the
village
of
shepperton

forthwith
the
six
guns
which
unknown
to
anyone
on
the
right
bank
had
been
hidden
behind
the
outskirts
of
that
village
fired
simultaneously

the
sudden
near
concussion
the
last
close
upon
the
first
made
my
heart
jump

the
monster
was
already
raising
the
case
generating
the
heatray
as
the
first
shell
burst
six
yards
above
the
hood

I
gave
a
cry
of
astonishment

I
saw
and
thought
nothing
of
the
other
four
martian
monsters
my
attention
was
riveted
upon
the
nearer
incident

simultaneously
two
other
shells
burst
in
the
air
near
the
body
as
the
hood
twisted
round
in
time
to
receive
but
not
in
time
to
dodge
the
fourth
shell

the
shell
burst
clean
in
the
face
of
the
thing

the
hood
bulged
flashed
was
whirled
off
in
a
dozen
tattered
fragments
of
red
flesh
and
glittering
metal

hit
shouted
I
with
something
between
a
scream
and
a
cheer

I
heard
answering
shouts
from
the
people
in
the
water
about
me

I
could
have
leaped
out
of
the
water
with
that
momentary
exultation

the
decapitated
colossus
reeled
like
a
drunken
giant
but
it
did
not
fall
over

it
recovered
its
balance
by
a
miracle
and
no
longer
heeding
its
steps
and
with
the
camera
that
fired
the
heatray
now
rigidly
upheld
it
reeled
swiftly
upon
shepperton

the
living
intelligence
the
martian
within
the
hood
was
slain
and
splashed
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
and
the
thing
was
now
but
a
mere
intricate
device
of
metal
whirling
to
destruction

it
drove
along
in
a
straight
line
incapable
of
guidance

it
struck
the
tower
of
shepperton
church
smashing
it
down
as
the
impact
of
a
battering
ram
might
have
done
swerved
aside
blundered
on
and
collapsed
with
tremendous
force
into
the
river
out
of
my
sight

a
violent
explosion
shook
the
air
and
a
spout
of
water
steam
mud
and
shattered
metal
shot
far
up
into
the
sky

as
the
camera
of
the
heatray
hit
the
water
the
latter
had
immediately
flashed
into
steam

in
another
moment
a
huge
wave
like
a
muddy
tidal
bore
but
almost
scaldingly
hot
came
sweeping
round
the
bend
upstream

I
saw
people
struggling
shorewards
and
heard
their
screaming
and
shouting
faintly
above
the
seething
and
roar
of
the
martian's
collapse

for
a
moment
I
heeded
nothing
of
the
heat
forgot
the
patent
need
of
selfpreservation

I
splashed
through
the
tumultuous
water
pushing
aside
a
man
in
black
to
do
so
until
I
could
see
round
the
bend

half
a
dozen
deserted
boats
pitched
aimlessly
upon
the
confusion
of
the
waves

the
fallen
martian
came
into
sight
downstream
lying
across
the
river
and
for
the
most
part
submerged

thick
clouds
of
steam
were
pouring
off
the
wreckage
and
through
the
tumultuously
whirling
wisps
I
could
see
intermittently
and
vaguely
the
gigantic
limbs
churning
the
water
and
flinging
a
splash
and
spray
of
mud
and
froth
into
the
air

the
tentacles
swayed
and
struck
like
living
arms
and
save
for
the
helpless
purposelessness
of
these
movements
it
was
as
if
some
wounded
thing
were
struggling
for
its
life
amid
the
waves

enormous
quantities
of
a
ruddybrown
fluid
were
spurting
up
in
noisy
jets
out
of
the
machine

my
attention
was
diverted
from
this
death
flurry
by
a
furious
yelling
like
that
of
the
thing
called
a
siren
in
our
manufacturing
towns

a
man
kneedeep
near
the
towing
path
shouted
inaudibly
to
me
and
pointed

looking
back
I
saw
the
other
martians
advancing
with
gigantic
strides
down
the
riverbank
from
the
direction
of
chertsey
the
shepperton
guns
spoke
this
time
unavailingly

at
that
I
ducked
at
once
under
water
and
holding
my
breath
until
movement
was
an
agony
blundered
painfully
ahead
under
the
surface
as
long
as
I
could

the
water
was
in
a
tumult
about
me
and
rapidly
growing
hotter

when
for
a
moment
I
raised
my
head
to
take
breath
and
throw
the
hair
and
water
from
my
eyes
the
steam
was
rising
in
a
whirling
white
fog
that
at
first
hid
the
martians
altogether

the
noise
was
deafening

then
I
saw
them
dimly
colossal
figures
of
grey
magnified
by
the
mist

they
had
passed
by
me
and
two
were
stooping
over
the
frothing
tumultuous
ruins
of
their
comrade

the
third
and
fourth
stood
beside
him
in
the
water
one
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
from
me
the
other
towards
laleham

the
generators
of
the
heatrays
waved
high
and
the
hissing
beams
smote
down
this
way
and
that

the
air
was
full
of
sound
a
deafening
and
confusing
conflict
of
noisesthe
clangorous
din
of
the
martians
the
crash
of
falling
houses
the
thud
of
trees
fences
sheds
flashing
into
flame
and
the
crackling
and
roaring
of
fire

dense
black
smoke
was
leaping
up
to
mingle
with
the
steam
from
the
river
and
as
the
heatray
went
to
and
fro
over
weybridge
its
impact
was
marked
by
flashes
of
incandescent
white
that
gave
place
at
once
to
a
smoky
dance
of
lurid
flames

the
nearer
houses
still
stood
intact
awaiting
their
fate
shadowy
faint
and
pallid
in
the
steam
with
the
fire
behind
them
going
to
and
fro

for
a
moment
perhaps
I
stood
there
breasthigh
in
the
almost
boiling
water
dumbfounded
at
my
position
hopeless
of
escape

through
the
reek
I
could
see
the
people
who
had
been
with
me
in
the
river
scrambling
out
of
the
water
through
the
reeds
like
little
frogs
hurrying
through
grass
from
the
advance
of
a
man
or
running
to
and
fro
in
utter
dismay
on
the
towing
path

then
suddenly
the
white
flashes
of
the
heatray
came
leaping
towards
me

the
houses
caved
in
as
they
dissolved
at
its
touch
and
darted
out
flames
the
trees
changed
to
fire
with
a
roar

the
ray
flickered
up
and
down
the
towing
path
licking
off
the
people
who
ran
this
way
and
that
and
came
down
to
the
water's
edge
not
fifty
yards
from
where
I
stood

it
swept
across
the
river
to
shepperton
and
the
water
in
its
track
rose
in
a
boiling
weal
crested
with
steam

I
turned
shoreward

in
another
moment
the
huge
wave
wellnigh
at
the
boilingpoint
had
rushed
upon
me

I
screamed
aloud
and
scalded
half
blinded
agonised
I
staggered
through
the
leaping
hissing
water
towards
the
shore

had
my
foot
stumbled
it
would
have
been
the
end

I
fell
helplessly
in
full
sight
of
the
martians
upon
the
broad
bare
gravelly
spit
that
runs
down
to
mark
the
angle
of
the
wey
and
thames
I
expected
nothing
but
death

I
have
a
dim
memory
of
the
foot
of
a
martian
coming
down
within
a
score
of
yards
of
my
head
driving
straight
into
the
loose
gravel
whirling
it
this
way
and
that
and
lifting
again
of
a
long
suspense
and
then
of
the
four
carrying
the
debris
of
their
comrade
between
them
now
clear
and
then
presently
faint
through
a
veil
of
smoke
receding
interminably
as
it
seemed
to
me
across
a
vast
space
of
river
and
meadow

and
then
very
slowly
I
realised
that
by
a
miracle
I
had
escaped



chapter
thirteen

how
I
fell
in
with
the
curate


after
getting
this
sudden
lesson
in
the
power
of
terrestrial
weapons
the
martians
retreated
to
their
original
position
upon
horsell
common
and
in
their
haste
and
encumbered
with
the
debris
of
their
smashed
companion
they
no
doubt
overlooked
many
such
a
stray
and
negligible
victim
as
myself

had
they
left
their
comrade
and
pushed
on
forthwith
there
was
nothing
at
that
time
between
them
and
london
but
batteries
of
twelvepounder
guns
and
they
would
certainly
have
reached
the
capital
in
advance
of
the
tidings
of
their
approach
as
sudden
dreadful
and
destructive
their
advent
would
have
been
as
the
earthquake
that
destroyed
lisbon
a
century
ago

but
they
were
in
no
hurry

cylinder
followed
cylinder
on
its
interplanetary
flight
every
twentyfour
hours
brought
them
reinforcement

and
meanwhile
the
military
and
naval
authorities
now
fully
alive
to
the
tremendous
power
of
their
antagonists
worked
with
furious
energy

every
minute
a
fresh
gun
came
into
position
until
before
twilight
every
copse
every
row
of
suburban
villas
on
the
hilly
slopes
about
kingston
and
richmond
masked
an
expectant
black
muzzle

and
through
the
charred
and
desolated
areaperhaps
twenty
square
miles
altogetherthat
encircled
the
martian
encampment
on
horsell
common
through
charred
and
ruined
villages
among
the
green
trees
through
the
blackened
and
smoking
arcades
that
had
been
but
a
day
ago
pine
spinneys
crawled
the
devoted
scouts
with
the
heliographs
that
were
presently
to
warn
the
gunners
of
the
martian
approach

but
the
martians
now
understood
our
command
of
artillery
and
the
danger
of
human
proximity
and
not
a
man
ventured
within
a
mile
of
either
cylinder
save
at
the
price
of
his
life

it
would
seem
that
these
giants
spent
the
earlier
part
of
the
afternoon
in
going
to
and
fro
transferring
everything
from
the
second
and
third
cylindersthe
second
in
addlestone
golf
links
and
the
third
at
pyrfordto
their
original
pit
on
horsell
common

over
that
above
the
blackened
heather
and
ruined
buildings
that
stretched
far
and
wide
stood
one
as
sentinel
while
the
rest
abandoned
their
vast
fightingmachines
and
descended
into
the
pit

they
were
hard
at
work
there
far
into
the
night
and
the
towering
pillar
of
dense
green
smoke
that
rose
therefrom
could
be
seen
from
the
hills
about
merrow
and
even
it
is
said
from
banstead
and
epsom
downs

and
while
the
martians
behind
me
were
thus
preparing
for
their
next
sally
and
in
front
of
me
humanity
gathered
for
the
battle
I
made
my
way
with
infinite
pains
and
labour
from
the
fire
and
smoke
of
burning
weybridge
towards
london

I
saw
an
abandoned
boat
very
small
and
remote
drifting
downstream
and
throwing
off
the
most
of
my
sodden
clothes
I
went
after
it
gained
it
and
so
escaped
out
of
that
destruction

there
were
no
oars
in
the
boat
but
I
contrived
to
paddle
as
well
as
my
parboiled
hands
would
allow
down
the
river
towards
halliford
and
walton
going
very
tediously
and
continually
looking
behind
me
as
you
may
well
understand

I
followed
the
river
because
I
considered
that
the
water
gave
me
my
best
chance
of
escape
should
these
giants
return

the
hot
water
from
the
martian's
overthrow
drifted
downstream
with
me
so
that
for
the
best
part
of
a
mile
I
could
see
little
of
either
bank

once
however
I
made
out
a
string
of
black
figures
hurrying
across
the
meadows
from
the
direction
of
weybridge

halliford
it
seemed
was
deserted
and
several
of
the
houses
facing
the
river
were
on
fire

it
was
strange
to
see
the
place
quite
tranquil
quite
desolate
under
the
hot
blue
sky
with
the
smoke
and
little
threads
of
flame
going
straight
up
into
the
heat
of
the
afternoon

never
before
had
I
seen
houses
burning
without
the
accompaniment
of
an
obstructive
crowd

a
little
farther
on
the
dry
reeds
up
the
bank
were
smoking
and
glowing
and
a
line
of
fire
inland
was
marching
steadily
across
a
late
field
of
hay

for
a
long
time
I
drifted
so
painful
and
weary
was
I
after
the
violence
I
had
been
through
and
so
intense
the
heat
upon
the
water
then
my
fears
got
the
better
of
me
again
and
I
resumed
my
paddling
the
sun
scorched
my
bare
back

at
last
as
the
bridge
at
walton
was
coming
into
sight
round
the
bend
my
fever
and
faintness
overcame
my
fears
and
I
landed
on
the
middlesex
bank
and
lay
down
deadly
sick
amid
the
long
grass

I
suppose
the
time
was
then
about
four
or
five
o'clock

I
got
up
presently
walked
perhaps
half
a
mile
without
meeting
a
soul
and
then
lay
down
again
in
the
shadow
of
a
hedge

I
seem
to
remember
talking
wanderingly
to
myself
during
that
last
spurt

I
was
also
very
thirsty
and
bitterly
regretful
I
had
drunk
no
more
water

it
is
a
curious
thing
that
I
felt
angry
with
my
wife
I
cannot
account
for
it
but
my
impotent
desire
to
reach
leatherhead
worried
me
excessively

I
do
not
clearly
remember
the
arrival
of
the
curate
so
that
probably
I
dozed

I
became
aware
of
him
as
a
seated
figure
in
sootsmudged
shirt
sleeves
and
with
his
upturned
cleanshaven
face
staring
at
a
faint
flickering
that
danced
over
the
sky

the
sky
was
what
is
called
a
mackerel
skyrows
and
rows
of
faint
downplumes
of
cloud
just
tinted
with
the
midsummer
sunset

I
sat
up
and
at
the
rustle
of
my
motion
he
looked
at
me
quickly

have
you
any
water
I
asked
abruptly

he
shook
his
head

you
have
been
asking
for
water
for
the
last
hour
he
said

for
a
moment
we
were
silent
taking
stock
of
each
other

I
dare
say
he
found
me
a
strange
enough
figure
naked
save
for
my
watersoaked
trousers
and
socks
scalded
and
my
face
and
shoulders
blackened
by
the
smoke

his
face
was
a
fair
weakness
his
chin
retreated
and
his
hair
lay
in
crisp
almost
flaxen
curls
on
his
low
forehead
his
eyes
were
rather
large
pale
blue
and
blankly
staring
he
spoke
abruptly
looking
vacantly
away
from
me

what
does
it
mean
he
said

what
do
these
things
mean

I
stared
at
him
and
made
no
answer

he
extended
a
thin
white
hand
and
spoke
in
almost
a
complaining
tone

why
are
these
things
permitted

what
sins
have
we
done

the
morning
service
was
over
I
was
walking
through
the
roads
to
clear
my
brain
for
the
afternoon
and
thenfire
earthquake
death

as
if
it
were
sodom
and
gomorrah

all
our
work
undone
all
the
work
what
are
these
martians

what
are
we
I
answered
clearing
my
throat

he
gripped
his
knees
and
turned
to
look
at
me
again

for
half
a
minute
perhaps
he
stared
silently

I
was
walking
through
the
roads
to
clear
my
brain
he
said

and
suddenlyfire
earthquake
death

he
relapsed
into
silence
with
his
chin
now
sunken
almost
to
his
knees

presently
he
began
waving
his
hand

all
the
workall
the
sunday
schoolswhat
have
we
donewhat
has
weybridge
done

everything
goneeverything
destroyed

the
church
we
rebuilt
it
only
three
years
ago

gone

swept
out
of
existence
why

another
pause
and
he
broke
out
again
like
one
demented

the
smoke
of
her
burning
goeth
up
for
ever
and
ever
he
shouted

his
eyes
flamed
and
he
pointed
a
lean
finger
in
the
direction
of
weybridge

by
this
time
I
was
beginning
to
take
his
measure

the
tremendous
tragedy
in
which
he
had
been
involvedit
was
evident
he
was
a
fugitive
from
weybridgehad
driven
him
to
the
very
verge
of
his
reason

are
we
far
from
sunbury
I
said
in
a
matteroffact
tone

what
are
we
to
do
he
asked

are
these
creatures
everywhere
has
the
earth
been
given
over
to
them

are
we
far
from
sunbury

only
this
morning
I
officiated
at
early
celebration

things
have
changed
I
said
quietly

you
must
keep
your
head
there
is
still
hope

hope

yes

plentiful
hopefor
all
this
destruction

I
began
to
explain
my
view
of
our
position

he
listened
at
first
but
as
I
went
on
the
interest
dawning
in
his
eyes
gave
place
to
their
former
stare
and
his
regard
wandered
from
me

this
must
be
the
beginning
of
the
end
he
said
interrupting
me
the
end

the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord

when
men
shall
call
upon
the
mountains
and
the
rocks
to
fall
upon
them
and
hide
themhide
them
from
the
face
of
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne

I
began
to
understand
the
position

I
ceased
my
laboured
reasoning
struggled
to
my
feet
and
standing
over
him
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder

be
a
man
said
I

you
are
scared
out
of
your
wits

what
good
is
religion
if
it
collapses
under
calamity

think
of
what
earthquakes
and
floods
wars
and
volcanoes
have
done
before
to
men

did
you
think
god
had
exempted
weybridge

he
is
not
an
insurance
agent

for
a
time
he
sat
in
blank
silence

but
how
can
we
escape
he
asked
suddenly

they
are
invulnerable
they
are
pitiless

neither
the
one
nor
perhaps
the
other
I
answered
and
the
mightier
they
are
the
more
sane
and
wary
should
we
be

one
of
them
was
killed
yonder
not
three
hours
ago

killed
he
said
staring
about
him

how
can
god's
ministers
be
killed

I
saw
it
happen
I
proceeded
to
tell
him

we
have
chanced
to
come
in
for
the
thick
of
it
said
I
and
that
is
all

what
is
that
flicker
in
the
sky
he
asked
abruptly

I
told
him
it
was
the
heliograph
signallingthat
it
was
the
sign
of
human
help
and
effort
in
the
sky

we
are
in
the
midst
of
it
I
said
quiet
as
it
is

that
flicker
in
the
sky
tells
of
the
gathering
storm

yonder
I
take
it
are
the
martians
and
londonward
where
those
hills
rise
about
richmond
and
kingston
and
the
trees
give
cover
earthworks
are
being
thrown
up
and
guns
are
being
placed

presently
the
martians
will
be
coming
this
way
again

and
even
as
I
spoke
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stopped
me
by
a
gesture

listen
he
said

from
beyond
the
low
hills
across
the
water
came
the
dull
resonance
of
distant
guns
and
a
remote
weird
crying

then
everything
was
still
a
cockchafer
came
droning
over
the
hedge
and
past
us

high
in
the
west
the
crescent
moon
hung
faint
and
pale
above
the
smoke
of
weybridge
and
shepperton
and
the
hot
still
splendour
of
the
sunset

we
had
better
follow
this
path
I
said
northward



chapter
fourteen

in
london


my
younger
brother
was
in
london
when
the
martians
fell
at
woking
he
was
a
medical
student
working
for
an
imminent
examination
and
he
heard
nothing
of
the
arrival
until
saturday
morning

the
morning
papers
on
saturday
contained
in
addition
to
lengthy
special
articles
on
the
planet
mars
on
life
in
the
planets
and
so
forth
a
brief
and
vaguely
worded
telegram
all
the
more
striking
for
its
brevity

the
martians
alarmed
by
the
approach
of
a
crowd
had
killed
a
number
of
people
with
a
quickfiring
gun
so
the
story
ran

the
telegram
concluded
with
the
words
formidable
as
they
seem
to
be
the
martians
have
not
moved
from
the
pit
into
which
they
have
fallen
and
indeed
seem
incapable
of
doing
so

probably
this
is
due
to
the
relative
strength
of
the
earth's
gravitational
energy

on
that
last
text
their
leaderwriter
expanded
very
comfortingly

of
course
all
the
students
in
the
crammer's
biology
class
to
which
my
brother
went
that
day
were
intensely
interested
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
unusual
excitement
in
the
streets

the
afternoon
papers
puffed
scraps
of
news
under
big
headlines

they
had
nothing
to
tell
beyond
the
movements
of
troops
about
the
common
and
the
burning
of
the
pine
woods
between
woking
and
weybridge
until
eight

then
the
st
james's
gazette
in
an
extraspecial
edition
announced
the
bare
fact
of
the
interruption
of
telegraphic
communication

this
was
thought
to
be
due
to
the
falling
of
burning
pine
trees
across
the
line

nothing
more
of
the
fighting
was
known
that
night
the
night
of
my
drive
to
leatherhead
and
back

my
brother
felt
no
anxiety
about
us
as
he
knew
from
the
description
in
the
papers
that
the
cylinder
was
a
good
two
miles
from
my
house

he
made
up
his
mind
to
run
down
that
night
to
me
in
order
as
he
says
to
see
the
things
before
they
were
killed

he
dispatched
a
telegram
which
never
reached
me
about
four
o'clock
and
spent
the
evening
at
a
music
hall

in
london
also
on
saturday
night
there
was
a
thunderstorm
and
my
brother
reached
waterloo
in
a
cab

on
the
platform
from
which
the
midnight
train
usually
starts
he
learned
after
some
waiting
that
an
accident
prevented
trains
from
reaching
woking
that
night

the
nature
of
the
accident
he
could
not
ascertain
indeed
the
railway
authorities
did
not
clearly
know
at
that
time

there
was
very
little
excitement
in
the
station
as
the
officials
failing
to
realise
that
anything
further
than
a
breakdown
between
byfleet
and
woking
junction
had
occurred
were
running
the
theatre
trains
which
usually
passed
through
woking
round
by
virginia
water
or
guildford

they
were
busy
making
the
necessary
arrangements
to
alter
the
route
of
the
southampton
and
portsmouth
sunday
league
excursions

a
nocturnal
newspaper
reporter
mistaking
my
brother
for
the
traffic
manager
to
whom
he
bears
a
slight
resemblance
waylaid
and
tried
to
interview
him

few
people
excepting
the
railway
officials
connected
the
breakdown
with
the
martians

I
have
read
in
another
account
of
these
events
that
on
sunday
morning
all
london
was
electrified
by
the
news
from
woking

as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
nothing
to
justify
that
very
extravagant
phrase

plenty
of
londoners
did
not
hear
of
the
martians
until
the
panic
of
monday
morning

those
who
did
took
some
time
to
realise
all
that
the
hastily
worded
telegrams
in
the
sunday
papers
conveyed

the
majority
of
people
in
london
do
not
read
sunday
papers

the
habit
of
personal
security
moreover
is
so
deeply
fixed
in
the
londoner's
mind
and
startling
intelligence
so
much
a
matter
of
course
in
the
papers
that
they
could
read
without
any
personal
tremors
about
seven
o'clock
last
night
the
martians
came
out
of
the
cylinder
and
moving
about
under
an
armour
of
metallic
shields
have
completely
wrecked
woking
station
with
the
adjacent
houses
and
massacred
an
entire
battalion
of
the
cardigan
regiment

no
details
are
known
maxims
have
been
absolutely
useless
against
their
armour
the
field
guns
have
been
disabled
by
them

flying
hussars
have
been
galloping
into
chertsey

the
martians
appear
to
be
moving
slowly
towards
chertsey
or
windsor

great
anxiety
prevails
in
west
surrey
and
earthworks
are
being
thrown
up
to
check
the
advance
londonward

that
was
how
the
sunday
sun
put
it
and
a
clever
and
remarkably
prompt
handbook
article
in
the
referee
compared
the
affair
to
a
menagerie
suddenly
let
loose
in
a
village

no
one
in
london
knew
positively
of
the
nature
of
the
armoured
martians
and
there
was
still
a
fixed
idea
that
these
monsters
must
be
sluggish
crawling
creeping
painfullysuch
expressions
occurred
in
almost
all
the
earlier
reports

none
of
the
telegrams
could
have
been
written
by
an
eyewitness
of
their
advance

the
sunday
papers
printed
separate
editions
as
further
news
came
to
hand
some
even
in
default
of
it

but
there
was
practically
nothing
more
to
tell
people
until
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
authorities
gave
the
press
agencies
the
news
in
their
possession

it
was
stated
that
the
people
of
walton
and
weybridge
and
all
the
district
were
pouring
along
the
roads
londonward
and
that
was
all

my
brother
went
to
church
at
the
foundling
hospital
in
the
morning
still
in
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
on
the
previous
night

there
he
heard
allusions
made
to
the
invasion
and
a
special
prayer
for
peace

coming
out
he
bought
a
referee

he
became
alarmed
at
the
news
in
this
and
went
again
to
waterloo
station
to
find
out
if
communication
were
restored

the
omnibuses
carriages
cyclists
and
innumerable
people
walking
in
their
best
clothes
seemed
scarcely
affected
by
the
strange
intelligence
that
the
news
venders
were
disseminating

people
were
interested
or
if
alarmed
alarmed
only
on
account
of
the
local
residents

at
the
station
he
heard
for
the
first
time
that
the
windsor
and
chertsey
lines
were
now
interrupted
the
porters
told
him
that
several
remarkable
telegrams
had
been
received
in
the
morning
from
byfleet
and
chertsey
stations
but
that
these
had
abruptly
ceased

my
brother
could
get
very
little
precise
detail
out
of
them

there's
fighting
going
on
about
weybridge
was
the
extent
of
their
information

the
train
service
was
now
very
much
disorganised

quite
a
number
of
people
who
had
been
expecting
friends
from
places
on
the
southwestern
network
were
standing
about
the
station

one
greyheaded
old
gentleman
came
and
abused
the
southwestern
company
bitterly
to
my
brother

it
wants
showing
up
he
said

one
or
two
trains
came
in
from
richmond
putney
and
kingston
containing
people
who
had
gone
out
for
a
day's
boating
and
found
the
locks
closed
and
a
feeling
of
panic
in
the
air

a
man
in
a
blue
and
white
blazer
addressed
my
brother
full
of
strange
tidings

there's
hosts
of
people
driving
into
kingston
in
traps
and
carts
and
things
with
boxes
of
valuables
and
all
that
he
said

they
come
from
molesey
and
weybridge
and
walton
and
they
say
there's
been
guns
heard
at
chertsey
heavy
firing
and
that
mounted
soldiers
have
told
them
to
get
off
at
once
because
the
martians
are
coming

we
heard
guns
firing
at
hampton
court
station
but
we
thought
it
was
thunder

what
the
dickens
does
it
all
mean

the
martians
can't
get
out
of
their
pit
can
they

my
brother
could
not
tell
him

afterwards
he
found
that
the
vague
feeling
of
alarm
had
spread
to
the
clients
of
the
underground
railway
and
that
the
sunday
excursionists
began
to
return
from
all
over
the
southwestern
lungbarnes
wimbledon
richmond
park
kew
and
so
forthat
unnaturally
early
hours
but
not
a
soul
had
anything
more
than
vague
hearsay
to
tell
of

everyone
connected
with
the
terminus
seemed
illtempered

about
five
o'clock
the
gathering
crowd
in
the
station
was
immensely
excited
by
the
opening
of
the
line
of
communication
which
is
almost
invariably
closed
between
the
southeastern
and
the
southwestern
stations
and
the
passage
of
carriage
trucks
bearing
huge
guns
and
carriages
crammed
with
soldiers

these
were
the
guns
that
were
brought
up
from
woolwich
and
chatham
to
cover
kingston

there
was
an
exchange
of
pleasantries
you'll
get
eaten

we're
the
beasttamers
and
so
forth

a
little
while
after
that
a
squad
of
police
came
into
the
station
and
began
to
clear
the
public
off
the
platforms
and
my
brother
went
out
into
the
street
again

the
church
bells
were
ringing
for
evensong
and
a
squad
of
salvation
army
lassies
came
singing
down
waterloo
road

on
the
bridge
a
number
of
loafers
were
watching
a
curious
brown
scum
that
came
drifting
down
the
stream
in
patches

the
sun
was
just
setting
and
the
clock
tower
and
the
houses
of
parliament
rose
against
one
of
the
most
peaceful
skies
it
is
possible
to
imagine
a
sky
of
gold
barred
with
long
transverse
stripes
of
reddishpurple
cloud

there
was
talk
of
a
floating
body

one
of
the
men
there
a
reservist
he
said
he
was
told
my
brother
he
had
seen
the
heliograph
flickering
in
the
west

in
wellington
street
my
brother
met
a
couple
of
sturdy
roughs
who
had
just
been
rushed
out
of
fleet
street
with
stillwet
newspapers
and
staring
placards

dreadful
catastrophe
they
bawled
one
to
the
other
down
wellington
street

fighting
at
weybridge

full
description

repulse
of
the
martians
london
in
danger

he
had
to
give
threepence
for
a
copy
of
that
paper

then
it
was
and
then
only
that
he
realised
something
of
the
full
power
and
terror
of
these
monsters

he
learned
that
they
were
not
merely
a
handful
of
small
sluggish
creatures
but
that
they
were
minds
swaying
vast
mechanical
bodies
and
that
they
could
move
swiftly
and
smite
with
such
power
that
even
the
mightiest
guns
could
not
stand
against
them

they
were
described
as
vast
spiderlike
machines
nearly
a
hundred
feet
high
capable
of
the
speed
of
an
express
train
and
able
to
shoot
out
a
beam
of
intense
heat

masked
batteries
chiefly
of
field
guns
had
been
planted
in
the
country
about
horsell
common
and
especially
between
the
woking
district
and
london

five
of
the
machines
had
been
seen
moving
towards
the
thames
and
one
by
a
happy
chance
had
been
destroyed

in
the
other
cases
the
shells
had
missed
and
the
batteries
had
been
at
once
annihilated
by
the
heatrays

heavy
losses
of
soldiers
were
mentioned
but
the
tone
of
the
dispatch
was
optimistic

the
martians
had
been
repulsed
they
were
not
invulnerable

they
had
retreated
to
their
triangle
of
cylinders
again
in
the
circle
about
woking

signallers
with
heliographs
were
pushing
forward
upon
them
from
all
sides

guns
were
in
rapid
transit
from
windsor
portsmouth
aldershot
woolwicheven
from
the
north
among
others
long
wireguns
of
ninetyfive
tons
from
woolwich

altogether
one
hundred
and
sixteen
were
in
position
or
being
hastily
placed
chiefly
covering
london

never
before
in
england
had
there
been
such
a
vast
or
rapid
concentration
of
military
material

any
further
cylinders
that
fell
it
was
hoped
could
be
destroyed
at
once
by
high
explosives
which
were
being
rapidly
manufactured
and
distributed

no
doubt
ran
the
report
the
situation
was
of
the
strangest
and
gravest
description
but
the
public
was
exhorted
to
avoid
and
discourage
panic

no
doubt
the
martians
were
strange
and
terrible
in
the
extreme
but
at
the
outside
there
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
of
them
against
our
millions

the
authorities
had
reason
to
suppose
from
the
size
of
the
cylinders
that
at
the
outside
there
could
not
be
more
than
five
in
each
cylinderfifteen
altogether

and
one
at
least
was
disposed
ofperhaps
more

the
public
would
be
fairly
warned
of
the
approach
of
danger
and
elaborate
measures
were
being
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
people
in
the
threatened
southwestern
suburbs

and
so
with
reiterated
assurances
of
the
safety
of
london
and
the
ability
of
the
authorities
to
cope
with
the
difficulty
this
quasiproclamation
closed

this
was
printed
in
enormous
type
on
paper
so
fresh
that
it
was
still
wet
and
there
had
been
no
time
to
add
a
word
of
comment

it
was
curious
my
brother
said
to
see
how
ruthlessly
the
usual
contents
of
the
paper
had
been
hacked
and
taken
out
to
give
this
place

all
down
wellington
street
people
could
be
seen
fluttering
out
the
pink
sheets
and
reading
and
the
strand
was
suddenly
noisy
with
the
voices
of
an
army
of
hawkers
following
these
pioneers

men
came
scrambling
off
buses
to
secure
copies

certainly
this
news
excited
people
intensely
whatever
their
previous
apathy

the
shutters
of
a
map
shop
in
the
strand
were
being
taken
down
my
brother
said
and
a
man
in
his
sunday
raiment
lemonyellow
gloves
even
was
visible
inside
the
window
hastily
fastening
maps
of
surrey
to
the
glass

going
on
along
the
strand
to
trafalgar
square
the
paper
in
his
hand
my
brother
saw
some
of
the
fugitives
from
west
surrey

there
was
a
man
with
his
wife
and
two
boys
and
some
articles
of
furniture
in
a
cart
such
as
greengrocers
use

he
was
driving
from
the
direction
of
westminster
bridge
and
close
behind
him
came
a
hay
waggon
with
five
or
six
respectablelooking
people
in
it
and
some
boxes
and
bundles
the
faces
of
these
people
were
haggard
and
their
entire
appearance
contrasted
conspicuously
with
the
sabbathbest
appearance
of
the
people
on
the
omnibuses

people
in
fashionable
clothing
peeped
at
them
out
of
cabs

they
stopped
at
the
square
as
if
undecided
which
way
to
take
and
finally
turned
eastward
along
the
strand

some
way
behind
these
came
a
man
in
workday
clothes
riding
one
of
those
oldfashioned
tricycles
with
a
small
front
wheel

he
was
dirty
and
white
in
the
face

my
brother
turned
down
towards
victoria
and
met
a
number
of
such
people

he
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
might
see
something
of
me

he
noticed
an
unusual
number
of
police
regulating
the
traffic

some
of
the
refugees
were
exchanging
news
with
the
people
on
the
omnibuses
one
was
professing
to
have
seen
the
martians

boilers
on
stilts
I
tell
you
striding
along
like
men

most
of
them
were
excited
and
animated
by
their
strange
experience

beyond
victoria
the
publichouses
were
doing
a
lively
trade
with
these
arrivals

at
all
the
street
corners
groups
of
people
were
reading
papers
talking
excitedly
or
staring
at
these
unusual
sunday
visitors

they
seemed
to
increase
as
night
drew
on
until
at
last
the
roads
my
brother
said
were
like
epsom
high
street
on
a
derby
day

my
brother
addressed
several
of
these
fugitives
and
got
unsatisfactory
answers
from
most

none
of
them
could
tell
him
any
news
of
woking
except
one
man
who
assured
him
that
woking
had
been
entirely
destroyed
on
the
previous
night

I
come
from
byfleet
he
said
man
on
a
bicycle
came
through
the
place
in
the
early
morning
and
ran
from
door
to
door
warning
us
to
come
away

then
came
soldiers

we
went
out
to
look
and
there
were
clouds
of
smoke
to
the
southnothing
but
smoke
and
not
a
soul
coming
that
way

then
we
heard
the
guns
at
chertsey
and
folks
coming
from
weybridge

so
i've
locked
up
my
house
and
come
on

at
the
time
there
was
a
strong
feeling
in
the
streets
that
the
authorities
were
to
blame
for
their
incapacity
to
dispose
of
the
invaders
without
all
this
inconvenience

about
eight
o'clock
a
noise
of
heavy
firing
was
distinctly
audible
all
over
the
south
of
london

my
brother
could
not
hear
it
for
the
traffic
in
the
main
thoroughfares
but
by
striking
through
the
quiet
back
streets
to
the
river
he
was
able
to
distinguish
it
quite
plainly

he
walked
from
westminster
to
his
apartments
near
regent's
park
about
two

he
was
now
very
anxious
on
my
account
and
disturbed
at
the
evident
magnitude
of
the
trouble

his
mind
was
inclined
to
run
even
as
mine
had
run
on
saturday
on
military
details

he
thought
of
all
those
silent
expectant
guns
of
the
suddenly
nomadic
countryside
he
tried
to
imagine
boilers
on
stilts
a
hundred
feet
high

there
were
one
or
two
cartloads
of
refugees
passing
along
oxford
street
and
several
in
the
marylebone
road
but
so
slowly
was
the
news
spreading
that
regent
street
and
portland
place
were
full
of
their
usual
sundaynight
promenaders
albeit
they
talked
in
groups
and
along
the
edge
of
regent's
park
there
were
as
many
silent
couples
walking
out
together
under
the
scattered
gas
lamps
as
ever
there
had
been

the
night
was
warm
and
still
and
a
little
oppressive
the
sound
of
guns
continued
intermittently
and
after
midnight
there
seemed
to
be
sheet
lightning
in
the
south

he
read
and
reread
the
paper
fearing
the
worst
had
happened
to
me
he
was
restless
and
after
supper
prowled
out
again
aimlessly

he
returned
and
tried
in
vain
to
divert
his
attention
to
his
examination
notes

he
went
to
bed
a
little
after
midnight
and
was
awakened
from
lurid
dreams
in
the
small
hours
of
monday
by
the
sound
of
door
knockers
feet
running
in
the
street
distant
drumming
and
a
clamour
of
bells

red
reflections
danced
on
the
ceiling

for
a
moment
he
lay
astonished
wondering
whether
day
had
come
or
the
world
gone
mad
then
he
jumped
out
of
bed
and
ran
to
the
window

his
room
was
an
attic
and
as
he
thrust
his
head
out
up
and
down
the
street
there
were
a
dozen
echoes
to
the
noise
of
his
window
sash
and
heads
in
every
kind
of
night
disarray
appeared

enquiries
were
being
shouted

they
are
coming
bawled
a
policeman
hammering
at
the
door
the
martians
are
coming
and
hurried
to
the
next
door

the
sound
of
drumming
and
trumpeting
came
from
the
albany
street
barracks
and
every
church
within
earshot
was
hard
at
work
killing
sleep
with
a
vehement
disorderly
tocsin

there
was
a
noise
of
doors
opening
and
window
after
window
in
the
houses
opposite
flashed
from
darkness
into
yellow
illumination

up
the
street
came
galloping
a
closed
carriage
bursting
abruptly
into
noise
at
the
corner
rising
to
a
clattering
climax
under
the
window
and
dying
away
slowly
in
the
distance

close
on
the
rear
of
this
came
a
couple
of
cabs
the
forerunners
of
a
long
procession
of
flying
vehicles
going
for
the
most
part
to
chalk
farm
station
where
the
northwestern
special
trains
were
loading
up
instead
of
coming
down
the
gradient
into
euston

for
a
long
time
my
brother
stared
out
of
the
window
in
blank
astonishment
watching
the
policemen
hammering
at
door
after
door
and
delivering
their
incomprehensible
message

then
the
door
behind
him
opened
and
the
man
who
lodged
across
the
landing
came
in
dressed
only
in
shirt
trousers
and
slippers
his
braces
loose
about
his
waist
his
hair
disordered
from
his
pillow

what
the
devil
is
it
he
asked

a
fire

what
a
devil
of
a
row

they
both
craned
their
heads
out
of
the
window
straining
to
hear
what
the
policemen
were
shouting

people
were
coming
out
of
the
side
streets
and
standing
in
groups
at
the
corners
talking

what
the
devil
is
it
all
about
said
my
brother's
fellow
lodger

my
brother
answered
him
vaguely
and
began
to
dress
running
with
each
garment
to
the
window
in
order
to
miss
nothing
of
the
growing
excitement

and
presently
men
selling
unnaturally
early
newspapers
came
bawling
into
the
street

london
in
danger
of
suffocation

the
kingston
and
richmond
defences
forced

fearful
massacres
in
the
thames
valley

and
all
about
himin
the
rooms
below
in
the
houses
on
each
side
and
across
the
road
and
behind
in
the
park
terraces
and
in
the
hundred
other
streets
of
that
part
of
marylebone
and
the
westbourne
park
district
and
st
pancras
and
westward
and
northward
in
kilburn
and
st
john's
wood
and
hampstead
and
eastward
in
shoreditch
and
highbury
and
haggerston
and
hoxton
and
indeed
through
all
the
vastness
of
london
from
ealing
to
east
hampeople
were
rubbing
their
eyes
and
opening
windows
to
stare
out
and
ask
aimless
questions
dressing
hastily
as
the
first
breath
of
the
coming
storm
of
fear
blew
through
the
streets

it
was
the
dawn
of
the
great
panic

london
which
had
gone
to
bed
on
sunday
night
oblivious
and
inert
was
awakened
in
the
small
hours
of
monday
morning
to
a
vivid
sense
of
danger

unable
from
his
window
to
learn
what
was
happening
my
brother
went
down
and
out
into
the
street
just
as
the
sky
between
the
parapets
of
the
houses
grew
pink
with
the
early
dawn

the
flying
people
on
foot
and
in
vehicles
grew
more
numerous
every
moment

black
smoke
he
heard
people
crying
and
again
black
smoke

the
contagion
of
such
a
unanimous
fear
was
inevitable

as
my
brother
hesitated
on
the
doorstep
he
saw
another
news
vender
approaching
and
got
a
paper
forthwith

the
man
was
running
away
with
the
rest
and
selling
his
papers
for
a
shilling
each
as
he
rana
grotesque
mingling
of
profit
and
panic

and
from
this
paper
my
brother
read
that
catastrophic
dispatch
of
the
commanderinchief

the
martians
are
able
to
discharge
enormous
clouds
of
a
black
and
poisonous
vapour
by
means
of
rockets

they
have
smothered
our
batteries
destroyed
richmond
kingston
and
wimbledon
and
are
advancing
slowly
towards
london
destroying
everything
on
the
way

it
is
impossible
to
stop
them

there
is
no
safety
from
the
black
smoke
but
in
instant
flight

that
was
all
but
it
was
enough

the
whole
population
of
the
great
sixmillion
city
was
stirring
slipping
running
presently
it
would
be
pouring
en
masse
northward

black
smoke
the
voices
cried

fire

the
bells
of
the
neighbouring
church
made
a
jangling
tumult
a
cart
carelessly
driven
smashed
amid
shrieks
and
curses
against
the
water
trough
up
the
street

sickly
yellow
lights
went
to
and
fro
in
the
houses
and
some
of
the
passing
cabs
flaunted
unextinguished
lamps
and
overhead
the
dawn
was
growing
brighter
clear
and
steady
and
calm

he
heard
footsteps
running
to
and
fro
in
the
rooms
and
up
and
down
stairs
behind
him

his
landlady
came
to
the
door
loosely
wrapped
in
dressing
gown
and
shawl
her
husband
followed
ejaculating

as
my
brother
began
to
realise
the
import
of
all
these
things
he
turned
hastily
to
his
own
room
put
all
his
available
moneysome
ten
pounds
altogetherinto
his
pockets
and
went
out
again
into
the
streets



chapter
fifteen

what
had
happened
in
surrey


it
was
while
the
curate
had
sat
and
talked
so
wildly
to
me
under
the
hedge
in
the
flat
meadows
near
halliford
and
while
my
brother
was
watching
the
fugitives
stream
over
westminster
bridge
that
the
martians
had
resumed
the
offensive

so
far
as
one
can
ascertain
from
the
conflicting
accounts
that
have
been
put
forth
the
majority
of
them
remained
busied
with
preparations
in
the
horsell
pit
until
nine
that
night
hurrying
on
some
operation
that
disengaged
huge
volumes
of
green
smoke

but
three
certainly
came
out
about
eight
o'clock
and
advancing
slowly
and
cautiously
made
their
way
through
byfleet
and
pyrford
towards
ripley
and
weybridge
and
so
came
in
sight
of
the
expectant
batteries
against
the
setting
sun

these
martians
did
not
advance
in
a
body
but
in
a
line
each
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
from
his
nearest
fellow

they
communicated
with
one
another
by
means
of
sirenlike
howls
running
up
and
down
the
scale
from
one
note
to
another

it
was
this
howling
and
firing
of
the
guns
at
ripley
and
st
george's
hill
that
we
had
heard
at
upper
halliford

the
ripley
gunners
unseasoned
artillery
volunteers
who
ought
never
to
have
been
placed
in
such
a
position
fired
one
wild
premature
ineffectual
volley
and
bolted
on
horse
and
foot
through
the
deserted
village
while
the
martian
without
using
his
heatray
walked
serenely
over
their
guns
stepped
gingerly
among
them
passed
in
front
of
them
and
so
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
guns
in
painshill
park
which
he
destroyed

the
st
george's
hill
men
however
were
better
led
or
of
a
better
mettle

hidden
by
a
pine
wood
as
they
were
they
seem
to
have
been
quite
unsuspected
by
the
martian
nearest
to
them

they
laid
their
guns
as
deliberately
as
if
they
had
been
on
parade
and
fired
at
about
a
thousand
yards'
range

the
shells
flashed
all
round
him
and
he
was
seen
to
advance
a
few
paces
stagger
and
go
down

everybody
yelled
together
and
the
guns
were
reloaded
in
frantic
haste

the
overthrown
martian
set
up
a
prolonged
ululation
and
immediately
a
second
glittering
giant
answering
him
appeared
over
the
trees
to
the
south

it
would
seem
that
a
leg
of
the
tripod
had
been
smashed
by
one
of
the
shells

the
whole
of
the
second
volley
flew
wide
of
the
martian
on
the
ground
and
simultaneously
both
his
companions
brought
their
heatrays
to
bear
on
the
battery

the
ammunition
blew
up
the
pine
trees
all
about
the
guns
flashed
into
fire
and
only
one
or
two
of
the
men
who
were
already
running
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
escaped

after
this
it
would
seem
that
the
three
took
counsel
together
and
halted
and
the
scouts
who
were
watching
them
report
that
they
remained
absolutely
stationary
for
the
next
half
hour

the
martian
who
had
been
overthrown
crawled
tediously
out
of
his
hood
a
small
brown
figure
oddly
suggestive
from
that
distance
of
a
speck
of
blight
and
apparently
engaged
in
the
repair
of
his
support

about
nine
he
had
finished
for
his
cowl
was
then
seen
above
the
trees
again

it
was
a
few
minutes
past
nine
that
night
when
these
three
sentinels
were
joined
by
four
other
martians
each
carrying
a
thick
black
tube

a
similar
tube
was
handed
to
each
of
the
three
and
the
seven
proceeded
to
distribute
themselves
at
equal
distances
along
a
curved
line
between
st
george's
hill
weybridge
and
the
village
of
send
southwest
of
ripley

a
dozen
rockets
sprang
out
of
the
hills
before
them
so
soon
as
they
began
to
move
and
warned
the
waiting
batteries
about
ditton
and
esher

at
the
same
time
four
of
their
fighting
machines
similarly
armed
with
tubes
crossed
the
river
and
two
of
them
black
against
the
western
sky
came
into
sight
of
myself
and
the
curate
as
we
hurried
wearily
and
painfully
along
the
road
that
runs
northward
out
of
halliford

they
moved
as
it
seemed
to
us
upon
a
cloud
for
a
milky
mist
covered
the
fields
and
rose
to
a
third
of
their
height

at
this
sight
the
curate
cried
faintly
in
his
throat
and
began
running
but
I
knew
it
was
no
good
running
from
a
martian
and
I
turned
aside
and
crawled
through
dewy
nettles
and
brambles
into
the
broad
ditch
by
the
side
of
the
road

he
looked
back
saw
what
I
was
doing
and
turned
to
join
me

the
two
halted
the
nearer
to
us
standing
and
facing
sunbury
the
remoter
being
a
grey
indistinctness
towards
the
evening
star
away
towards
staines

the
occasional
howling
of
the
martians
had
ceased
they
took
up
their
positions
in
the
huge
crescent
about
their
cylinders
in
absolute
silence

it
was
a
crescent
with
twelve
miles
between
its
horns

never
since
the
devising
of
gunpowder
was
the
beginning
of
a
battle
so
still

to
us
and
to
an
observer
about
ripley
it
would
have
had
precisely
the
same
effectthe
martians
seemed
in
solitary
possession
of
the
darkling
night
lit
only
as
it
was
by
the
slender
moon
the
stars
the
afterglow
of
the
daylight
and
the
ruddy
glare
from
st
george's
hill
and
the
woods
of
painshill

but
facing
that
crescent
everywhereat
staines
hounslow
ditton
esher
ockham
behind
hills
and
woods
south
of
the
river
and
across
the
flat
grass
meadows
to
the
north
of
it
wherever
a
cluster
of
trees
or
village
houses
gave
sufficient
coverthe
guns
were
waiting

the
signal
rockets
burst
and
rained
their
sparks
through
the
night
and
vanished
and
the
spirit
of
all
those
watching
batteries
rose
to
a
tense
expectation

the
martians
had
but
to
advance
into
the
line
of
fire
and
instantly
those
motionless
black
forms
of
men
those
guns
glittering
so
darkly
in
the
early
night
would
explode
into
a
thunderous
fury
of
battle

no
doubt
the
thought
that
was
uppermost
in
a
thousand
of
those
vigilant
minds
even
as
it
was
uppermost
in
mine
was
the
riddlehow
much
they
understood
of
us

did
they
grasp
that
we
in
our
millions
were
organized
disciplined
working
together

or
did
they
interpret
our
spurts
of
fire
the
sudden
stinging
of
our
shells
our
steady
investment
of
their
encampment
as
we
should
the
furious
unanimity
of
onslaught
in
a
disturbed
hive
of
bees

did
they
dream
they
might
exterminate
us

at
that
time
no
one
knew
what
food
they
needed

a
hundred
such
questions
struggled
together
in
my
mind
as
I
watched
that
vast
sentinel
shape

and
in
the
back
of
my
mind
was
the
sense
of
all
the
huge
unknown
and
hidden
forces
londonward

had
they
prepared
pitfalls
were
the
powder
mills
at
hounslow
ready
as
a
snare

would
the
londoners
have
the
heart
and
courage
to
make
a
greater
moscow
of
their
mighty
province
of
houses

then
after
an
interminable
time
as
it
seemed
to
us
crouching
and
peering
through
the
hedge
came
a
sound
like
the
distant
concussion
of
a
gun

another
nearer
and
then
another

and
then
the
martian
beside
us
raised
his
tube
on
high
and
discharged
it
gunwise
with
a
heavy
report
that
made
the
ground
heave

the
one
towards
staines
answered
him

there
was
no
flash
no
smoke
simply
that
loaded
detonation

I
was
so
excited
by
these
heavy
minuteguns
following
one
another
that
I
so
far
forgot
my
personal
safety
and
my
scalded
hands
as
to
clamber
up
into
the
hedge
and
stare
towards
sunbury

as
I
did
so
a
second
report
followed
and
a
big
projectile
hurtled
overhead
towards
hounslow

I
expected
at
least
to
see
smoke
or
fire
or
some
such
evidence
of
its
work

but
all
I
saw
was
the
deep
blue
sky
above
with
one
solitary
star
and
the
white
mist
spreading
wide
and
low
beneath
and
there
had
been
no
crash
no
answering
explosion

the
silence
was
restored
the
minute
lengthened
to
three

what
has
happened
said
the
curate
standing
up
beside
me

heaven
knows
said
I

a
bat
flickered
by
and
vanished

a
distant
tumult
of
shouting
began
and
ceased

I
looked
again
at
the
martian
and
saw
he
was
now
moving
eastward
along
the
riverbank
with
a
swift
rolling
motion

every
moment
I
expected
the
fire
of
some
hidden
battery
to
spring
upon
him
but
the
evening
calm
was
unbroken

the
figure
of
the
martian
grew
smaller
as
he
receded
and
presently
the
mist
and
the
gathering
night
had
swallowed
him
up

by
a
common
impulse
we
clambered
higher
towards
sunbury
was
a
dark
appearance
as
though
a
conical
hill
had
suddenly
come
into
being
there
hiding
our
view
of
the
farther
country
and
then
remoter
across
the
river
over
walton
we
saw
another
such
summit

these
hilllike
forms
grew
lower
and
broader
even
as
we
stared

moved
by
a
sudden
thought
I
looked
northward
and
there
I
perceived
a
third
of
these
cloudy
black
kopjes
had
risen

everything
had
suddenly
become
very
still

far
away
to
the
southeast
marking
the
quiet
we
heard
the
martians
hooting
to
one
another
and
then
the
air
quivered
again
with
the
distant
thud
of
their
guns

but
the
earthly
artillery
made
no
reply

now
at
the
time
we
could
not
understand
these
things
but
later
I
was
to
learn
the
meaning
of
these
ominous
kopjes
that
gathered
in
the
twilight

each
of
the
martians
standing
in
the
great
crescent
I
have
described
had
discharged
by
means
of
the
gunlike
tube
he
carried
a
huge
canister
over
whatever
hill
copse
cluster
of
houses
or
other
possible
cover
for
guns
chanced
to
be
in
front
of
him

some
fired
only
one
of
these
some
twoas
in
the
case
of
the
one
we
had
seen
the
one
at
ripley
is
said
to
have
discharged
no
fewer
than
five
at
that
time

these
canisters
smashed
on
striking
the
groundthey
did
not
explodeand
incontinently
disengaged
an
enormous
volume
of
heavy
inky
vapour
coiling
and
pouring
upward
in
a
huge
and
ebony
cumulus
cloud
a
gaseous
hill
that
sank
and
spread
itself
slowly
over
the
surrounding
country

and
the
touch
of
that
vapour
the
inhaling
of
its
pungent
wisps
was
death
to
all
that
breathes

it
was
heavy
this
vapour
heavier
than
the
densest
smoke
so
that
after
the
first
tumultuous
uprush
and
outflow
of
its
impact
it
sank
down
through
the
air
and
poured
over
the
ground
in
a
manner
rather
liquid
than
gaseous
abandoning
the
hills
and
streaming
into
the
valleys
and
ditches
and
watercourses
even
as
I
have
heard
the
carbonicacid
gas
that
pours
from
volcanic
clefts
is
wont
to
do

and
where
it
came
upon
water
some
chemical
action
occurred
and
the
surface
would
be
instantly
covered
with
a
powdery
scum
that
sank
slowly
and
made
way
for
more

the
scum
was
absolutely
insoluble
and
it
is
a
strange
thing
seeing
the
instant
effect
of
the
gas
that
one
could
drink
without
hurt
the
water
from
which
it
had
been
strained
the
vapour
did
not
diffuse
as
a
true
gas
would
do

it
hung
together
in
banks
flowing
sluggishly
down
the
slope
of
the
land
and
driving
reluctantly
before
the
wind
and
very
slowly
it
combined
with
the
mist
and
moisture
of
the
air
and
sank
to
the
earth
in
the
form
of
dust
save
that
an
unknown
element
giving
a
group
of
four
lines
in
the
blue
of
the
spectrum
is
concerned
we
are
still
entirely
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
this
substance

once
the
tumultuous
upheaval
of
its
dispersion
was
over
the
black
smoke
clung
so
closely
to
the
ground
even
before
its
precipitation
that
fifty
feet
up
in
the
air
on
the
roofs
and
upper
stories
of
high
houses
and
on
great
trees
there
was
a
chance
of
escaping
its
poison
altogether
as
was
proved
even
that
night
at
street
cobham
and
ditton

the
man
who
escaped
at
the
former
place
tells
a
wonderful
story
of
the
strangeness
of
its
coiling
flow
and
how
he
looked
down
from
the
church
spire
and
saw
the
houses
of
the
village
rising
like
ghosts
out
of
its
inky
nothingness

for
a
day
and
a
half
he
remained
there
weary
starving
and
sunscorched
the
earth
under
the
blue
sky
and
against
the
prospect
of
the
distant
hills
a
velvetblack
expanse
with
red
roofs
green
trees
and
later
blackveiled
shrubs
and
gates
barns
outhouses
and
walls
rising
here
and
there
into
the
sunlight

but
that
was
at
street
cobham
where
the
black
vapour
was
allowed
to
remain
until
it
sank
of
its
own
accord
into
the
ground

as
a
rule
the
martians
when
it
had
served
its
purpose
cleared
the
air
of
it
again
by
wading
into
it
and
directing
a
jet
of
steam
upon
it

this
they
did
with
the
vapour
banks
near
us
as
we
saw
in
the
starlight
from
the
window
of
a
deserted
house
at
upper
halliford
whither
we
had
returned

from
there
we
could
see
the
searchlights
on
richmond
hill
and
kingston
hill
going
to
and
fro
and
about
eleven
the
windows
rattled
and
we
heard
the
sound
of
the
huge
siege
guns
that
had
been
put
in
position
there

these
continued
intermittently
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sending
chance
shots
at
the
invisible
martians
at
hampton
and
ditton
and
then
the
pale
beams
of
the
electric
light
vanished
and
were
replaced
by
a
bright
red
glow

then
the
fourth
cylinder
fella
brilliant
green
meteoras
I
learned
afterwards
in
bushey
park

before
the
guns
on
the
richmond
and
kingston
line
of
hills
began
there
was
a
fitful
cannonade
far
away
in
the
southwest
due
I
believe
to
guns
being
fired
haphazard
before
the
black
vapour
could
overwhelm
the
gunners

so
setting
about
it
as
methodically
as
men
might
smoke
out
a
wasps'
nest
the
martians
spread
this
strange
stifling
vapour
over
the
londonward
country

the
horns
of
the
crescent
slowly
moved
apart
until
at
last
they
formed
a
line
from
hanwell
to
coombe
and
malden
all
night
through
their
destructive
tubes
advanced

never
once
after
the
martian
at
st
george's
hill
was
brought
down
did
they
give
the
artillery
the
ghost
of
a
chance
against
them

wherever
there
was
a
possibility
of
guns
being
laid
for
them
unseen
a
fresh
canister
of
the
black
vapour
was
discharged
and
where
the
guns
were
openly
displayed
the
heatray
was
brought
to
bear

by
midnight
the
blazing
trees
along
the
slopes
of
richmond
park
and
the
glare
of
kingston
hill
threw
their
light
upon
a
network
of
black
smoke
blotting
out
the
whole
valley
of
the
thames
and
extending
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach

and
through
this
two
martians
slowly
waded
and
turned
their
hissing
steam
jets
this
way
and
that

they
were
sparing
of
the
heatray
that
night
either
because
they
had
but
a
limited
supply
of
material
for
its
production
or
because
they
did
not
wish
to
destroy
the
country
but
only
to
crush
and
overawe
the
opposition
they
had
aroused

in
the
latter
aim
they
certainly
succeeded

sunday
night
was
the
end
of
the
organised
opposition
to
their
movements

after
that
no
body
of
men
would
stand
against
them
so
hopeless
was
the
enterprise

even
the
crews
of
the
torpedoboats
and
destroyers
that
had
brought
their
quickfirers
up
the
thames
refused
to
stop
mutinied
and
went
down
again

the
only
offensive
operation
men
ventured
upon
after
that
night
was
the
preparation
of
mines
and
pitfalls
and
even
in
that
their
energies
were
frantic
and
spasmodic

one
has
to
imagine
as
well
as
one
may
the
fate
of
those
batteries
towards
esher
waiting
so
tensely
in
the
twilight

survivors
there
were
none

one
may
picture
the
orderly
expectation
the
officers
alert
and
watchful
the
gunners
ready
the
ammunition
piled
to
hand
the
limber
gunners
with
their
horses
and
waggons
the
groups
of
civilian
spectators
standing
as
near
as
they
were
permitted
the
evening
stillness
the
ambulances
and
hospital
tents
with
the
burned
and
wounded
from
weybridge
then
the
dull
resonance
of
the
shots
the
martians
fired
and
the
clumsy
projectile
whirling
over
the
trees
and
houses
and
smashing
amid
the
neighbouring
fields

one
may
picture
too
the
sudden
shifting
of
the
attention
the
swiftly
spreading
coils
and
bellyings
of
that
blackness
advancing
headlong
towering
heavenward
turning
the
twilight
to
a
palpable
darkness
a
strange
and
horrible
antagonist
of
vapour
striding
upon
its
victims
men
and
horses
near
it
seen
dimly
running
shrieking
falling
headlong
shouts
of
dismay
the
guns
suddenly
abandoned
men
choking
and
writhing
on
the
ground
and
the
swift
broadeningout
of
the
opaque
cone
of
smoke

and
then
night
and
extinctionnothing
but
a
silent
mass
of
impenetrable
vapour
hiding
its
dead

before
dawn
the
black
vapour
was
pouring
through
the
streets
of
richmond
and
the
disintegrating
organism
of
government
was
with
a
last
expiring
effort
rousing
the
population
of
london
to
the
necessity
of
flight



chapter
sixteen

the
exodus
from
london


so
you
understand
the
roaring
wave
of
fear
that
swept
through
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
just
as
monday
was
dawningthe
stream
of
flight
rising
swiftly
to
a
torrent
lashing
in
a
foaming
tumult
round
the
railway
stations
banked
up
into
a
horrible
struggle
about
the
shipping
in
the
thames
and
hurrying
by
every
available
channel
northward
and
eastward

by
ten
o'clock
the
police
organisation
and
by
midday
even
the
railway
organisations
were
losing
coherency
losing
shape
and
efficiency
guttering
softening
running
at
last
in
that
swift
liquefaction
of
the
social
body

all
the
railway
lines
north
of
the
thames
and
the
southeastern
people
at
cannon
street
had
been
warned
by
midnight
on
sunday
and
trains
were
being
filled

people
were
fighting
savagely
for
standingroom
in
the
carriages
even
at
two
o'clock

by
three
people
were
being
trampled
and
crushed
even
in
bishopsgate
street
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
or
more
from
liverpool
street
station
revolvers
were
fired
people
stabbed
and
the
policemen
who
had
been
sent
to
direct
the
traffic
exhausted
and
infuriated
were
breaking
the
heads
of
the
people
they
were
called
out
to
protect

and
as
the
day
advanced
and
the
engine
drivers
and
stokers
refused
to
return
to
london
the
pressure
of
the
flight
drove
the
people
in
an
everthickening
multitude
away
from
the
stations
and
along
the
northwardrunning
roads

by
midday
a
martian
had
been
seen
at
barnes
and
a
cloud
of
slowly
sinking
black
vapour
drove
along
the
thames
and
across
the
flats
of
lambeth
cutting
off
all
escape
over
the
bridges
in
its
sluggish
advance

another
bank
drove
over
ealing
and
surrounded
a
little
island
of
survivors
on
castle
hill
alive
but
unable
to
escape

after
a
fruitless
struggle
to
get
aboard
a
northwestern
train
at
chalk
farmthe
engines
of
the
trains
that
had
loaded
in
the
goods
yard
there
ploughed
through
shrieking
people
and
a
dozen
stalwart
men
fought
to
keep
the
crowd
from
crushing
the
driver
against
his
furnacemy
brother
emerged
upon
the
chalk
farm
road
dodged
across
through
a
hurrying
swarm
of
vehicles
and
had
the
luck
to
be
foremost
in
the
sack
of
a
cycle
shop

the
front
tire
of
the
machine
he
got
was
punctured
in
dragging
it
through
the
window
but
he
got
up
and
off
notwithstanding
with
no
further
injury
than
a
cut
wrist

the
steep
foot
of
haverstock
hill
was
impassable
owing
to
several
overturned
horses
and
my
brother
struck
into
belsize
road

so
he
got
out
of
the
fury
of
the
panic
and
skirting
the
edgware
road
reached
edgware
about
seven
fasting
and
wearied
but
well
ahead
of
the
crowd

along
the
road
people
were
standing
in
the
roadway
curious
wondering

he
was
passed
by
a
number
of
cyclists
some
horsemen
and
two
motor
cars

a
mile
from
edgware
the
rim
of
the
wheel
broke
and
the
machine
became
unridable

he
left
it
by
the
roadside
and
trudged
through
the
village

there
were
shops
half
opened
in
the
main
street
of
the
place
and
people
crowded
on
the
pavement
and
in
the
doorways
and
windows
staring
astonished
at
this
extraordinary
procession
of
fugitives
that
was
beginning

he
succeeded
in
getting
some
food
at
an
inn

for
a
time
he
remained
in
edgware
not
knowing
what
next
to
do

the
flying
people
increased
in
number

many
of
them
like
my
brother
seemed
inclined
to
loiter
in
the
place

there
was
no
fresh
news
of
the
invaders
from
mars

at
that
time
the
road
was
crowded
but
as
yet
far
from
congested
most
of
the
fugitives
at
that
hour
were
mounted
on
cycles
but
there
were
soon
motor
cars
hansom
cabs
and
carriages
hurrying
along
and
the
dust
hung
in
heavy
clouds
along
the
road
to
st
albans

it
was
perhaps
a
vague
idea
of
making
his
way
to
chelmsford
where
some
friends
of
his
lived
that
at
last
induced
my
brother
to
strike
into
a
quiet
lane
running
eastward

presently
he
came
upon
a
stile
and
crossing
it
followed
a
footpath
northeastward

he
passed
near
several
farmhouses
and
some
little
places
whose
names
he
did
not
learn

he
saw
few
fugitives
until
in
a
grass
lane
towards
high
barnet
he
happened
upon
two
ladies
who
became
his
fellow
travellers
he
came
upon
them
just
in
time
to
save
them

he
heard
their
screams
and
hurrying
round
the
corner
saw
a
couple
of
men
struggling
to
drag
them
out
of
the
little
ponychaise
in
which
they
had
been
driving
while
a
third
with
difficulty
held
the
frightened
pony's
head

one
of
the
ladies
a
short
woman
dressed
in
white
was
simply
screaming
the
other
a
dark
slender
figure
slashed
at
the
man
who
gripped
her
arm
with
a
whip
she
held
in
her
disengaged
hand

my
brother
immediately
grasped
the
situation
shouted
and
hurried
towards
the
struggle

one
of
the
men
desisted
and
turned
towards
him
and
my
brother
realising
from
his
antagonist's
face
that
a
fight
was
unavoidable
and
being
an
expert
boxer
went
into
him
forthwith
and
sent
him
down
against
the
wheel
of
the
chaise

it
was
no
time
for
pugilistic
chivalry
and
my
brother
laid
him
quiet
with
a
kick
and
gripped
the
collar
of
the
man
who
pulled
at
the
slender
lady's
arm

he
heard
the
clatter
of
hoofs
the
whip
stung
across
his
face
a
third
antagonist
struck
him
between
the
eyes
and
the
man
he
held
wrenched
himself
free
and
made
off
down
the
lane
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come

partly
stunned
he
found
himself
facing
the
man
who
had
held
the
horse's
head
and
became
aware
of
the
chaise
receding
from
him
down
the
lane
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
with
the
women
in
it
looking
back

the
man
before
him
a
burly
rough
tried
to
close
and
he
stopped
him
with
a
blow
in
the
face

then
realising
that
he
was
deserted
he
dodged
round
and
made
off
down
the
lane
after
the
chaise
with
the
sturdy
man
close
behind
him
and
the
fugitive
who
had
turned
now
following
remotely

suddenly
he
stumbled
and
fell
his
immediate
pursuer
went
headlong
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
to
find
himself
with
a
couple
of
antagonists
again

he
would
have
had
little
chance
against
them
had
not
the
slender
lady
very
pluckily
pulled
up
and
returned
to
his
help

it
seems
she
had
had
a
revolver
all
this
time
but
it
had
been
under
the
seat
when
she
and
her
companion
were
attacked

she
fired
at
six
yards'
distance
narrowly
missing
my
brother

the
less
courageous
of
the
robbers
made
off
and
his
companion
followed
him
cursing
his
cowardice

they
both
stopped
in
sight
down
the
lane
where
the
third
man
lay
insensible

take
this
said
the
slender
lady
and
she
gave
my
brother
her
revolver

go
back
to
the
chaise
said
my
brother
wiping
the
blood
from
his
split
lip

she
turned
without
a
wordthey
were
both
pantingand
they
went
back
to
where
the
lady
in
white
struggled
to
hold
back
the
frightened
pony

the
robbers
had
evidently
had
enough
of
it

when
my
brother
looked
again
they
were
retreating

i'll
sit
here
said
my
brother
if
I
may
and
he
got
upon
the
empty
front
seat

the
lady
looked
over
her
shoulder

give
me
the
reins
she
said
and
laid
the
whip
along
the
pony's
side

in
another
moment
a
bend
in
the
road
hid
the
three
men
from
my
brother's
eyes

so
quite
unexpectedly
my
brother
found
himself
panting
with
a
cut
mouth
a
bruised
jaw
and
bloodstained
knuckles
driving
along
an
unknown
lane
with
these
two
women

he
learned
they
were
the
wife
and
the
younger
sister
of
a
surgeon
living
at
stanmore
who
had
come
in
the
small
hours
from
a
dangerous
case
at
pinner
and
heard
at
some
railway
station
on
his
way
of
the
martian
advance

he
had
hurried
home
roused
the
womentheir
servant
had
left
them
two
days
beforepacked
some
provisions
put
his
revolver
under
the
seatluckily
for
my
brotherand
told
them
to
drive
on
to
edgware
with
the
idea
of
getting
a
train
there

he
stopped
behind
to
tell
the
neighbours

he
would
overtake
them
he
said
at
about
half
past
four
in
the
morning
and
now
it
was
nearly
nine
and
they
had
seen
nothing
of
him

they
could
not
stop
in
edgware
because
of
the
growing
traffic
through
the
place
and
so
they
had
come
into
this
side
lane

that
was
the
story
they
told
my
brother
in
fragments
when
presently
they
stopped
again
nearer
to
new
barnet

he
promised
to
stay
with
them
at
least
until
they
could
determine
what
to
do
or
until
the
missing
man
arrived
and
professed
to
be
an
expert
shot
with
the
revolvera
weapon
strange
to
himin
order
to
give
them
confidence

they
made
a
sort
of
encampment
by
the
wayside
and
the
pony
became
happy
in
the
hedge

he
told
them
of
his
own
escape
out
of
london
and
all
that
he
knew
of
these
martians
and
their
ways

the
sun
crept
higher
in
the
sky
and
after
a
time
their
talk
died
out
and
gave
place
to
an
uneasy
state
of
anticipation

several
wayfarers
came
along
the
lane
and
of
these
my
brother
gathered
such
news
as
he
could

every
broken
answer
he
had
deepened
his
impression
of
the
great
disaster
that
had
come
on
humanity
deepened
his
persuasion
of
the
immediate
necessity
for
prosecuting
this
flight

he
urged
the
matter
upon
them

we
have
money
said
the
slender
woman
and
hesitated

her
eyes
met
my
brother's
and
her
hesitation
ended

so
have
I
said
my
brother

she
explained
that
they
had
as
much
as
thirty
pounds
in
gold
besides
a
fivepound
note
and
suggested
that
with
that
they
might
get
upon
a
train
at
st
albans
or
new
barnet

my
brother
thought
that
was
hopeless
seeing
the
fury
of
the
londoners
to
crowd
upon
the
trains
and
broached
his
own
idea
of
striking
across
essex
towards
harwich
and
thence
escaping
from
the
country
altogether

mrs
elphinstonethat
was
the
name
of
the
woman
in
whitewould
listen
to
no
reasoning
and
kept
calling
upon
george
but
her
sisterinlaw
was
astonishingly
quiet
and
deliberate
and
at
last
agreed
to
my
brother's
suggestion

so
designing
to
cross
the
great
north
road
they
went
on
towards
barnet
my
brother
leading
the
pony
to
save
it
as
much
as
possible

as
the
sun
crept
up
the
sky
the
day
became
excessively
hot
and
under
foot
a
thick
whitish
sand
grew
burning
and
blinding
so
that
they
travelled
only
very
slowly

the
hedges
were
grey
with
dust

and
as
they
advanced
towards
barnet
a
tumultuous
murmuring
grew
stronger

they
began
to
meet
more
people

for
the
most
part
these
were
staring
before
them
murmuring
indistinct
questions
jaded
haggard
unclean

one
man
in
evening
dress
passed
them
on
foot
his
eyes
on
the
ground

they
heard
his
voice
and
looking
back
at
him
saw
one
hand
clutched
in
his
hair
and
the
other
beating
invisible
things

his
paroxysm
of
rage
over
he
went
on
his
way
without
once
looking
back

as
my
brother's
party
went
on
towards
the
crossroads
to
the
south
of
barnet
they
saw
a
woman
approaching
the
road
across
some
fields
on
their
left
carrying
a
child
and
with
two
other
children
and
then
passed
a
man
in
dirty
black
with
a
thick
stick
in
one
hand
and
a
small
portmanteau
in
the
other

then
round
the
corner
of
the
lane
from
between
the
villas
that
guarded
it
at
its
confluence
with
the
high
road
came
a
little
cart
drawn
by
a
sweating
black
pony
and
driven
by
a
sallow
youth
in
a
bowler
hat
grey
with
dust

there
were
three
girls
east
end
factory
girls
and
a
couple
of
little
children
crowded
in
the
cart

this'll
tike
us
rahnd
edgware
asked
the
driver
wildeyed
whitefaced
and
when
my
brother
told
him
it
would
if
he
turned
to
the
left
he
whipped
up
at
once
without
the
formality
of
thanks

my
brother
noticed
a
pale
grey
smoke
or
haze
rising
among
the
houses
in
front
of
them
and
veiling
the
white
facade
of
a
terrace
beyond
the
road
that
appeared
between
the
backs
of
the
villas

mrs
elphinstone
suddenly
cried
out
at
a
number
of
tongues
of
smoky
red
flame
leaping
up
above
the
houses
in
front
of
them
against
the
hot
blue
sky

the
tumultuous
noise
resolved
itself
now
into
the
disorderly
mingling
of
many
voices
the
gride
of
many
wheels
the
creaking
of
waggons
and
the
staccato
of
hoofs

the
lane
came
round
sharply
not
fifty
yards
from
the
crossroads

good
heavens
cried
mrs
elphinstone

what
is
this
you
are
driving
us
into

my
brother
stopped

for
the
main
road
was
a
boiling
stream
of
people
a
torrent
of
human
beings
rushing
northward
one
pressing
on
another

a
great
bank
of
dust
white
and
luminous
in
the
blaze
of
the
sun
made
everything
within
twenty
feet
of
the
ground
grey
and
indistinct
and
was
perpetually
renewed
by
the
hurrying
feet
of
a
dense
crowd
of
horses
and
of
men
and
women
on
foot
and
by
the
wheels
of
vehicles
of
every
description

way
my
brother
heard
voices
crying

make
way

it
was
like
riding
into
the
smoke
of
a
fire
to
approach
the
meeting
point
of
the
lane
and
road
the
crowd
roared
like
a
fire
and
the
dust
was
hot
and
pungent

and
indeed
a
little
way
up
the
road
a
villa
was
burning
and
sending
rolling
masses
of
black
smoke
across
the
road
to
add
to
the
confusion

two
men
came
past
them

then
a
dirty
woman
carrying
a
heavy
bundle
and
weeping

a
lost
retriever
dog
with
hanging
tongue
circled
dubiously
round
them
scared
and
wretched
and
fled
at
my
brother's
threat

so
much
as
they
could
see
of
the
road
londonward
between
the
houses
to
the
right
was
a
tumultuous
stream
of
dirty
hurrying
people
pent
in
between
the
villas
on
either
side
the
black
heads
the
crowded
forms
grew
into
distinctness
as
they
rushed
towards
the
corner
hurried
past
and
merged
their
individuality
again
in
a
receding
multitude
that
was
swallowed
up
at
last
in
a
cloud
of
dust

go
on

go
on
cried
the
voices

way

way

one
man's
hands
pressed
on
the
back
of
another

my
brother
stood
at
the
pony's
head

irresistibly
attracted
he
advanced
slowly
pace
by
pace
down
the
lane

edgware
had
been
a
scene
of
confusion
chalk
farm
a
riotous
tumult
but
this
was
a
whole
population
in
movement

it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
host

it
had
no
character
of
its
own

the
figures
poured
out
past
the
corner
and
receded
with
their
backs
to
the
group
in
the
lane

along
the
margin
came
those
who
were
on
foot
threatened
by
the
wheels
stumbling
in
the
ditches
blundering
into
one
another

the
carts
and
carriages
crowded
close
upon
one
another
making
little
way
for
those
swifter
and
more
impatient
vehicles
that
darted
forward
every
now
and
then
when
an
opportunity
showed
itself
of
doing
so
sending
the
people
scattering
against
the
fences
and
gates
of
the
villas

push
on
was
the
cry

push
on

they
are
coming

in
one
cart
stood
a
blind
man
in
the
uniform
of
the
salvation
army
gesticulating
with
his
crooked
fingers
and
bawling
eternity
eternity

his
voice
was
hoarse
and
very
loud
so
that
my
brother
could
hear
him
long
after
he
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
dust

some
of
the
people
who
crowded
in
the
carts
whipped
stupidly
at
their
horses
and
quarrelled
with
other
drivers
some
sat
motionless
staring
at
nothing
with
miserable
eyes
some
gnawed
their
hands
with
thirst
or
lay
prostrate
in
the
bottoms
of
their
conveyances

the
horses'
bits
were
covered
with
foam
their
eyes
bloodshot

there
were
cabs
carriages
shop
cars
waggons
beyond
counting
a
mail
cart
a
roadcleaner's
cart
marked
vestry
of
st
pancras
a
huge
timber
waggon
crowded
with
roughs

a
brewer's
dray
rumbled
by
with
its
two
near
wheels
splashed
with
fresh
blood

clear
the
way
cried
the
voices

clear
the
way

eternity

eternity
came
echoing
down
the
road

there
were
sad
haggard
women
tramping
by
well
dressed
with
children
that
cried
and
stumbled
their
dainty
clothes
smothered
in
dust
their
weary
faces
smeared
with
tears

with
many
of
these
came
men
sometimes
helpful
sometimes
lowering
and
savage

fighting
side
by
side
with
them
pushed
some
weary
street
outcast
in
faded
black
rags
wideeyed
loudvoiced
and
foulmouthed

there
were
sturdy
workmen
thrusting
their
way
along
wretched
unkempt
men
clothed
like
clerks
or
shopmen
struggling
spasmodically
a
wounded
soldier
my
brother
noticed
men
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
railway
porters
one
wretched
creature
in
a
nightshirt
with
a
coat
thrown
over
it

but
varied
as
its
composition
was
certain
things
all
that
host
had
in
common

there
were
fear
and
pain
on
their
faces
and
fear
behind
them

a
tumult
up
the
road
a
quarrel
for
a
place
in
a
waggon
sent
the
whole
host
of
them
quickening
their
pace
even
a
man
so
scared
and
broken
that
his
knees
bent
under
him
was
galvanised
for
a
moment
into
renewed
activity

the
heat
and
dust
had
already
been
at
work
upon
this
multitude

their
skins
were
dry
their
lips
black
and
cracked
they
were
all
thirsty
weary
and
footsore

and
amid
the
various
cries
one
heard
disputes
reproaches
groans
of
weariness
and
fatigue
the
voices
of
most
of
them
were
hoarse
and
weak

through
it
all
ran
a
refrain

way

way

the
martians
are
coming

few
stopped
and
came
aside
from
that
flood

the
lane
opened
slantingly
into
the
main
road
with
a
narrow
opening
and
had
a
delusive
appearance
of
coming
from
the
direction
of
london

yet
a
kind
of
eddy
of
people
drove
into
its
mouth
weaklings
elbowed
out
of
the
stream
who
for
the
most
part
rested
but
a
moment
before
plunging
into
it
again

a
little
way
down
the
lane
with
two
friends
bending
over
him
lay
a
man
with
a
bare
leg
wrapped
about
with
bloody
rags
he
was
a
lucky
man
to
have
friends

a
little
old
man
with
a
grey
military
moustache
and
a
filthy
black
frock
coat
limped
out
and
sat
down
beside
the
trap
removed
his
boothis
sock
was
bloodstainedshook
out
a
pebble
and
hobbled
on
again
and
then
a
little
girl
of
eight
or
nine
all
alone
threw
herself
under
the
hedge
close
by
my
brother
weeping

I
can't
go
on

I
can't
go
on

my
brother
woke
from
his
torpor
of
astonishment
and
lifted
her
up
speaking
gently
to
her
and
carried
her
to
miss
elphinstone

so
soon
as
my
brother
touched
her
she
became
quite
still
as
if
frightened

ellen
shrieked
a
woman
in
the
crowd
with
tears
in
her
voiceellen

and
the
child
suddenly
darted
away
from
my
brother
crying
mother

they
are
coming
said
a
man
on
horseback
riding
past
along
the
lane

out
of
the
way
there
bawled
a
coachman
towering
high
and
my
brother
saw
a
closed
carriage
turning
into
the
lane

the
people
crushed
back
on
one
another
to
avoid
the
horse

my
brother
pushed
the
pony
and
chaise
back
into
the
hedge
and
the
man
drove
by
and
stopped
at
the
turn
of
the
way

it
was
a
carriage
with
a
pole
for
a
pair
of
horses
but
only
one
was
in
the
traces

my
brother
saw
dimly
through
the
dust
that
two
men
lifted
out
something
on
a
white
stretcher
and
put
it
gently
on
the
grass
beneath
the
privet
hedge

one
of
the
men
came
running
to
my
brother

where
is
there
any
water
he
said

he
is
dying
fast
and
very
thirsty

it
is
lord
garrick

lord
garrick
said
my
brother
the
chief
justice

the
water
he
said

there
may
be
a
tap
said
my
brother
in
some
of
the
houses

we
have
no
water

I
dare
not
leave
my
people

the
man
pushed
against
the
crowd
towards
the
gate
of
the
corner
house

go
on
said
the
people
thrusting
at
him

they
are
coming

go
on

then
my
brother's
attention
was
distracted
by
a
bearded
eaglefaced
man
lugging
a
small
handbag
which
split
even
as
my
brother's
eyes
rested
on
it
and
disgorged
a
mass
of
sovereigns
that
seemed
to
break
up
into
separate
coins
as
it
struck
the
ground

they
rolled
hither
and
thither
among
the
struggling
feet
of
men
and
horses

the
man
stopped
and
looked
stupidly
at
the
heap
and
the
shaft
of
a
cab
struck
his
shoulder
and
sent
him
reeling

he
gave
a
shriek
and
dodged
back
and
a
cartwheel
shaved
him
narrowly

way
cried
the
men
all
about
him

make
way

so
soon
as
the
cab
had
passed
he
flung
himself
with
both
hands
open
upon
the
heap
of
coins
and
began
thrusting
handfuls
in
his
pocket

a
horse
rose
close
upon
him
and
in
another
moment
half
rising
he
had
been
borne
down
under
the
horse's
hoofs

stop
screamed
my
brother
and
pushing
a
woman
out
of
his
way
tried
to
clutch
the
bit
of
the
horse

before
he
could
get
to
it
he
heard
a
scream
under
the
wheels
and
saw
through
the
dust
the
rim
passing
over
the
poor
wretch's
back

the
driver
of
the
cart
slashed
his
whip
at
my
brother
who
ran
round
behind
the
cart

the
multitudinous
shouting
confused
his
ears

the
man
was
writhing
in
the
dust
among
his
scattered
money
unable
to
rise
for
the
wheel
had
broken
his
back
and
his
lower
limbs
lay
limp
and
dead

my
brother
stood
up
and
yelled
at
the
next
driver
and
a
man
on
a
black
horse
came
to
his
assistance

get
him
out
of
the
road
said
he
and
clutching
the
man's
collar
with
his
free
hand
my
brother
lugged
him
sideways

but
he
still
clutched
after
his
money
and
regarded
my
brother
fiercely
hammering
at
his
arm
with
a
handful
of
gold

go
on

go
on
shouted
angry
voices
behind

way

way

there
was
a
smash
as
the
pole
of
a
carriage
crashed
into
the
cart
that
the
man
on
horseback
stopped

my
brother
looked
up
and
the
man
with
the
gold
twisted
his
head
round
and
bit
the
wrist
that
held
his
collar

there
was
a
concussion
and
the
black
horse
came
staggering
sideways
and
the
carthorse
pushed
beside
it

a
hoof
missed
my
brother's
foot
by
a
hair's
breadth

he
released
his
grip
on
the
fallen
man
and
jumped
back

he
saw
anger
change
to
terror
on
the
face
of
the
poor
wretch
on
the
ground
and
in
a
moment
he
was
hidden
and
my
brother
was
borne
backward
and
carried
past
the
entrance
of
the
lane
and
had
to
fight
hard
in
the
torrent
to
recover
it

he
saw
miss
elphinstone
covering
her
eyes
and
a
little
child
with
all
a
child's
want
of
sympathetic
imagination
staring
with
dilated
eyes
at
a
dusty
something
that
lay
black
and
still
ground
and
crushed
under
the
rolling
wheels

let
us
go
back
he
shouted
and
began
turning
the
pony
round
we
cannot
cross
thishell
he
said
and
they
went
back
a
hundred
yards
the
way
they
had
come
until
the
fighting
crowd
was
hidden

as
they
passed
the
bend
in
the
lane
my
brother
saw
the
face
of
the
dying
man
in
the
ditch
under
the
privet
deadly
white
and
drawn
and
shining
with
perspiration

the
two
women
sat
silent
crouching
in
their
seat
and
shivering

then
beyond
the
bend
my
brother
stopped
again

miss
elphinstone
was
white
and
pale
and
her
sisterinlaw
sat
weeping
too
wretched
even
to
call
upon
george

my
brother
was
horrified
and
perplexed
so
soon
as
they
had
retreated
he
realised
how
urgent
and
unavoidable
it
was
to
attempt
this
crossing

he
turned
to
miss
elphinstone
suddenly
resolute

we
must
go
that
way
he
said
and
led
the
pony
round
again

for
the
second
time
that
day
this
girl
proved
her
quality

to
force
their
way
into
the
torrent
of
people
my
brother
plunged
into
the
traffic
and
held
back
a
cab
horse
while
she
drove
the
pony
across
its
head

a
waggon
locked
wheels
for
a
moment
and
ripped
a
long
splinter
from
the
chaise

in
another
moment
they
were
caught
and
swept
forward
by
the
stream

my
brother
with
the
cabman's
whip
marks
red
across
his
face
and
hands
scrambled
into
the
chaise
and
took
the
reins
from
her

point
the
revolver
at
the
man
behind
he
said
giving
it
to
her
if
he
presses
us
too
hard

nopoint
it
at
his
horse

then
he
began
to
look
out
for
a
chance
of
edging
to
the
right
across
the
road

but
once
in
the
stream
he
seemed
to
lose
volition
to
become
a
part
of
that
dusty
rout

they
swept
through
chipping
barnet
with
the
torrent
they
were
nearly
a
mile
beyond
the
centre
of
the
town
before
they
had
fought
across
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
way

it
was
din
and
confusion
indescribable
but
in
and
beyond
the
town
the
road
forks
repeatedly
and
this
to
some
extent
relieved
the
stress

they
struck
eastward
through
hadley
and
there
on
either
side
of
the
road
and
at
another
place
farther
on
they
came
upon
a
great
multitude
of
people
drinking
at
the
stream
some
fighting
to
come
at
the
water

and
farther
on
from
a
lull
near
east
barnet
they
saw
two
trains
running
slowly
one
after
the
other
without
signal
or
ordertrains
swarming
with
people
with
men
even
among
the
coals
behind
the
enginesgoing
northward
along
the
great
northern
railway
my
brother
supposes
they
must
have
filled
outside
london
for
at
that
time
the
furious
terror
of
the
people
had
rendered
the
central
termini
impossible

near
this
place
they
halted
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
for
the
violence
of
the
day
had
already
utterly
exhausted
all
three
of
them
they
began
to
suffer
the
beginnings
of
hunger
the
night
was
cold
and
none
of
them
dared
to
sleep

and
in
the
evening
many
people
came
hurrying
along
the
road
nearby
their
stopping
place
fleeing
from
unknown
dangers
before
them
and
going
in
the
direction
from
which
my
brother
had
come



chapter
seventeen

the
thunder
child


had
the
martians
aimed
only
at
destruction
they
might
on
monday
have
annihilated
the
entire
population
of
london
as
it
spread
itself
slowly
through
the
home
counties

not
only
along
the
road
through
barnet
but
also
through
edgware
and
waltham
abbey
and
along
the
roads
eastward
to
southend
and
shoeburyness
and
south
of
the
thames
to
deal
and
broadstairs
poured
the
same
frantic
rout

if
one
could
have
hung
that
june
morning
in
a
balloon
in
the
blazing
blue
above
london
every
northward
and
eastward
road
running
out
of
the
tangled
maze
of
streets
would
have
seemed
stippled
black
with
the
streaming
fugitives
each
dot
a
human
agony
of
terror
and
physical
distress

I
have
set
forth
at
length
in
the
last
chapter
my
brother's
account
of
the
road
through
chipping
barnet
in
order
that
my
readers
may
realise
how
that
swarming
of
black
dots
appeared
to
one
of
those
concerned
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
such
a
mass
of
human
beings
moved
and
suffered
together

the
legendary
hosts
of
goths
and
huns
the
hugest
armies
asia
has
ever
seen
would
have
been
but
a
drop
in
that
current

and
this
was
no
disciplined
march
it
was
a
stampedea
stampede
gigantic
and
terriblewithout
order
and
without
a
goal
six
million
people
unarmed
and
unprovisioned
driving
headlong

it
was
the
beginning
of
the
rout
of
civilisation
of
the
massacre
of
mankind

directly
below
him
the
balloonist
would
have
seen
the
network
of
streets
far
and
wide
houses
churches
squares
crescents
gardensalready
derelictspread
out
like
a
huge
map
and
in
the
southward
blotted

over
ealing
richmond
wimbledon
it
would
have
seemed
as
if
some
monstrous
pen
had
flung
ink
upon
the
chart
steadily
incessantly
each
black
splash
grew
and
spread
shooting
out
ramifications
this
way
and
that
now
banking
itself
against
rising
ground
now
pouring
swiftly
over
a
crest
into
a
newfound
valley
exactly
as
a
gout
of
ink
would
spread
itself
upon
blotting
paper

and
beyond
over
the
blue
hills
that
rise
southward
of
the
river
the
glittering
martians
went
to
and
fro
calmly
and
methodically
spreading
their
poison
cloud
over
this
patch
of
country
and
then
over
that
laying
it
again
with
their
steam
jets
when
it
had
served
its
purpose
and
taking
possession
of
the
conquered
country

they
do
not
seem
to
have
aimed
at
extermination
so
much
as
at
complete
demoralisation
and
the
destruction
of
any
opposition

they
exploded
any
stores
of
powder
they
came
upon
cut
every
telegraph
and
wrecked
the
railways
here
and
there

they
were
hamstringing
mankind

they
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
extend
the
field
of
their
operations
and
did
not
come
beyond
the
central
part
of
london
all
that
day

it
is
possible
that
a
very
considerable
number
of
people
in
london
stuck
to
their
houses
through
monday
morning

certain
it
is
that
many
died
at
home
suffocated
by
the
black
smoke

until
about
midday
the
pool
of
london
was
an
astonishing
scene
steamboats
and
shipping
of
all
sorts
lay
there
tempted
by
the
enormous
sums
of
money
offered
by
fugitives
and
it
is
said
that
many
who
swam
out
to
these
vessels
were
thrust
off
with
boathooks
and
drowned

about
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
thinning
remnant
of
a
cloud
of
the
black
vapour
appeared
between
the
arches
of
blackfriars
bridge

at
that
the
pool
became
a
scene
of
mad
confusion
fighting
and
collision
and
for
some
time
a
multitude
of
boats
and
barges
jammed
in
the
northern
arch
of
the
tower
bridge
and
the
sailors
and
lightermen
had
to
fight
savagely
against
the
people
who
swarmed
upon
them
from
the
riverfront

people
were
actually
clambering
down
the
piers
of
the
bridge
from
above

when
an
hour
later
a
martian
appeared
beyond
the
clock
tower
and
waded
down
the
river
nothing
but
wreckage
floated
above
limehouse

of
the
falling
of
the
fifth
cylinder
I
have
presently
to
tell

the
sixth
star
fell
at
wimbledon

my
brother
keeping
watch
beside
the
women
in
the
chaise
in
a
meadow
saw
the
green
flash
of
it
far
beyond
the
hills

on
tuesday
the
little
party
still
set
upon
getting
across
the
sea
made
its
way
through
the
swarming
country
towards
colchester
the
news
that
the
martians
were
now
in
possession
of
the
whole
of
london
was
confirmed

they
had
been
seen
at
highgate
and
even
it
was
said
at
neasden

but
they
did
not
come
into
my
brother's
view
until
the
morrow

that
day
the
scattered
multitudes
began
to
realise
the
urgent
need
of
provisions

as
they
grew
hungry
the
rights
of
property
ceased
to
be
regarded

farmers
were
out
to
defend
their
cattlesheds
granaries
and
ripening
root
crops
with
arms
in
their
hands

a
number
of
people
now
like
my
brother
had
their
faces
eastward
and
there
were
some
desperate
souls
even
going
back
towards
london
to
get
food
these
were
chiefly
people
from
the
northern
suburbs
whose
knowledge
of
the
black
smoke
came
by
hearsay

he
heard
that
about
half
the
members
of
the
government
had
gathered
at
birmingham
and
that
enormous
quantities
of
high
explosives
were
being
prepared
to
be
used
in
automatic
mines
across
the
midland
counties

he
was
also
told
that
the
midland
railway
company
had
replaced
the
desertions
of
the
first
day's
panic
had
resumed
traffic
and
was
running
northward
trains
from
st
albans
to
relieve
the
congestion
of
the
home
counties

there
was
also
a
placard
in
chipping
ongar
announcing
that
large
stores
of
flour
were
available
in
the
northern
towns
and
that
within
twentyfour
hours
bread
would
be
distributed
among
the
starving
people
in
the
neighbourhood

but
this
intelligence
did
not
deter
him
from
the
plan
of
escape
he
had
formed
and
the
three
pressed
eastward
all
day
and
heard
no
more
of
the
bread
distribution
than
this
promise

nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
anyone
else
hear
more
of
it

that
night
fell
the
seventh
star
falling
upon
primrose
hill

it
fell
while
miss
elphinstone
was
watching
for
she
took
that
duty
alternately
with
my
brother

she
saw
it

on
wednesday
the
three
fugitivesthey
had
passed
the
night
in
a
field
of
unripe
wheatreached
chelmsford
and
there
a
body
of
the
inhabitants
calling
itself
the
committee
of
public
supply
seized
the
pony
as
provisions
and
would
give
nothing
in
exchange
for
it
but
the
promise
of
a
share
in
it
the
next
day

here
there
were
rumours
of
martians
at
epping
and
news
of
the
destruction
of
waltham
abbey
powder
mills
in
a
vain
attempt
to
blow
up
one
of
the
invaders

people
were
watching
for
martians
here
from
the
church
towers

my
brother
very
luckily
for
him
as
it
chanced
preferred
to
push
on
at
once
to
the
coast
rather
than
wait
for
food
although
all
three
of
them
were
very
hungry

by
midday
they
passed
through
tillingham
which
strangely
enough
seemed
to
be
quite
silent
and
deserted
save
for
a
few
furtive
plunderers
hunting
for
food

near
tillingham
they
suddenly
came
in
sight
of
the
sea
and
the
most
amazing
crowd
of
shipping
of
all
sorts
that
it
is
possible
to
imagine

for
after
the
sailors
could
no
longer
come
up
the
thames
they
came
on
to
the
essex
coast
to
harwich
and
walton
and
clacton
and
afterwards
to
foulness
and
shoebury
to
bring
off
the
people

they
lay
in
a
huge
sickleshaped
curve
that
vanished
into
mist
at
last
towards
the
naze

close
inshore
was
a
multitude
of
fishing
smacksenglish
scotch
french
dutch
and
swedish
steam
launches
from
the
thames
yachts
electric
boats
and
beyond
were
ships
of
large
burden
a
multitude
of
filthy
colliers
trim
merchantmen
cattle
ships
passenger
boats
petroleum
tanks
ocean
tramps
an
old
white
transport
even
neat
white
and
grey
liners
from
southampton
and
hamburg
and
along
the
blue
coast
across
the
blackwater
my
brother
could
make
out
dimly
a
dense
swarm
of
boats
chaffering
with
the
people
on
the
beach
a
swarm
which
also
extended
up
the
blackwater
almost
to
maldon

about
a
couple
of
miles
out
lay
an
ironclad
very
low
in
the
water
almost
to
my
brother's
perception
like
a
waterlogged
ship

this
was
the
ram
thunder
child

it
was
the
only
warship
in
sight
but
far
away
to
the
right
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
seafor
that
day
there
was
a
dead
calmlay
a
serpent
of
black
smoke
to
mark
the
next
ironclads
of
the
channel
fleet
which
hovered
in
an
extended
line
steam
up
and
ready
for
action
across
the
thames
estuary
during
the
course
of
the
martian
conquest
vigilant
and
yet
powerless
to
prevent
it

at
the
sight
of
the
sea
mrs
elphinstone
in
spite
of
the
assurances
of
her
sisterinlaw
gave
way
to
panic

she
had
never
been
out
of
england
before
she
would
rather
die
than
trust
herself
friendless
in
a
foreign
country
and
so
forth

she
seemed
poor
woman
to
imagine
that
the
french
and
the
martians
might
prove
very
similar
she
had
been
growing
increasingly
hysterical
fearful
and
depressed
during
the
two
days'
journeyings

her
great
idea
was
to
return
to
stanmore

things
had
been
always
well
and
safe
at
stanmore

they
would
find
george
at
stanmore

it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
they
could
get
her
down
to
the
beach
where
presently
my
brother
succeeded
in
attracting
the
attention
of
some
men
on
a
paddle
steamer
from
the
thames

they
sent
a
boat
and
drove
a
bargain
for
thirtysix
pounds
for
the
three

the
steamer
was
going
these
men
said
to
ostend

it
was
about
two
o'clock
when
my
brother
having
paid
their
fares
at
the
gangway
found
himself
safely
aboard
the
steamboat
with
his
charges

there
was
food
aboard
albeit
at
exorbitant
prices
and
the
three
of
them
contrived
to
eat
a
meal
on
one
of
the
seats
forward

there
were
already
a
couple
of
score
of
passengers
aboard
some
of
whom
had
expended
their
last
money
in
securing
a
passage
but
the
captain
lay
off
the
blackwater
until
five
in
the
afternoon
picking
up
passengers
until
the
seated
decks
were
even
dangerously
crowded

he
would
probably
have
remained
longer
had
it
not
been
for
the
sound
of
guns
that
began
about
that
hour
in
the
south

as
if
in
answer
the
ironclad
seaward
fired
a
small
gun
and
hoisted
a
string
of
flags

a
jet
of
smoke
sprang
out
of
her
funnels

some
of
the
passengers
were
of
opinion
that
this
firing
came
from
shoeburyness
until
it
was
noticed
that
it
was
growing
louder

at
the
same
time
far
away
in
the
southeast
the
masts
and
upperworks
of
three
ironclads
rose
one
after
the
other
out
of
the
sea
beneath
clouds
of
black
smoke

but
my
brother's
attention
speedily
reverted
to
the
distant
firing
in
the
south

he
fancied
he
saw
a
column
of
smoke
rising
out
of
the
distant
grey
haze

the
little
steamer
was
already
flapping
her
way
eastward
of
the
big
crescent
of
shipping
and
the
low
essex
coast
was
growing
blue
and
hazy
when
a
martian
appeared
small
and
faint
in
the
remote
distance
advancing
along
the
muddy
coast
from
the
direction
of
foulness

at
that
the
captain
on
the
bridge
swore
at
the
top
of
his
voice
with
fear
and
anger
at
his
own
delay
and
the
paddles
seemed
infected
with
his
terror

every
soul
aboard
stood
at
the
bulwarks
or
on
the
seats
of
the
steamer
and
stared
at
that
distant
shape
higher
than
the
trees
or
church
towers
inland
and
advancing
with
a
leisurely
parody
of
a
human
stride

it
was
the
first
martian
my
brother
had
seen
and
he
stood
more
amazed
than
terrified
watching
this
titan
advancing
deliberately
towards
the
shipping
wading
farther
and
farther
into
the
water
as
the
coast
fell
away

then
far
away
beyond
the
crouch
came
another
striding
over
some
stunted
trees
and
then
yet
another
still
farther
off
wading
deeply
through
a
shiny
mudflat
that
seemed
to
hang
halfway
up
between
sea
and
sky

they
were
all
stalking
seaward
as
if
to
intercept
the
escape
of
the
multitudinous
vessels
that
were
crowded
between
foulness
and
the
naze

in
spite
of
the
throbbing
exertions
of
the
engines
of
the
little
paddleboat
and
the
pouring
foam
that
her
wheels
flung
behind
her
she
receded
with
terrifying
slowness
from
this
ominous
advance

glancing
northwestward
my
brother
saw
the
large
crescent
of
shipping
already
writhing
with
the
approaching
terror
one
ship
passing
behind
another
another
coming
round
from
broadside
to
end
on
steamships
whistling
and
giving
off
volumes
of
steam
sails
being
let
out
launches
rushing
hither
and
thither

he
was
so
fascinated
by
this
and
by
the
creeping
danger
away
to
the
left
that
he
had
no
eyes
for
anything
seaward

and
then
a
swift
movement
of
the
steamboat
she
had
suddenly
come
round
to
avoid
being
run
down
flung
him
headlong
from
the
seat
upon
which
he
was
standing

there
was
a
shouting
all
about
him
a
trampling
of
feet
and
a
cheer
that
seemed
to
be
answered
faintly

the
steamboat
lurched
and
rolled
him
over
upon
his
hands

he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
saw
to
starboard
and
not
a
hundred
yards
from
their
heeling
pitching
boat
a
vast
iron
bulk
like
the
blade
of
a
plough
tearing
through
the
water
tossing
it
on
either
side
in
huge
waves
of
foam
that
leaped
towards
the
steamer
flinging
her
paddles
helplessly
in
the
air
and
then
sucking
her
deck
down
almost
to
the
waterline

a
douche
of
spray
blinded
my
brother
for
a
moment

when
his
eyes
were
clear
again
he
saw
the
monster
had
passed
and
was
rushing
landward

big
iron
upperworks
rose
out
of
this
headlong
structure
and
from
that
twin
funnels
projected
and
spat
a
smoking
blast
shot
with
fire

it
was
the
torpedo
ram
thunder
child
steaming
headlong
coming
to
the
rescue
of
the
threatened
shipping

keeping
his
footing
on
the
heaving
deck
by
clutching
the
bulwarks
my
brother
looked
past
this
charging
leviathan
at
the
martians
again
and
he
saw
the
three
of
them
now
close
together
and
standing
so
far
out
to
sea
that
their
tripod
supports
were
almost
entirely
submerged
thus
sunken
and
seen
in
remote
perspective
they
appeared
far
less
formidable
than
the
huge
iron
bulk
in
whose
wake
the
steamer
was
pitching
so
helplessly

it
would
seem
they
were
regarding
this
new
antagonist
with
astonishment

to
their
intelligence
it
may
be
the
giant
was
even
such
another
as
themselves

the
thunder
child
fired
no
gun
but
simply
drove
full
speed
towards
them

it
was
probably
her
not
firing
that
enabled
her
to
get
so
near
the
enemy
as
she
did

they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
her

one
shell
and
they
would
have
sent
her
to
the
bottom
forthwith
with
the
heatray

she
was
steaming
at
such
a
pace
that
in
a
minute
she
seemed
halfway
between
the
steamboat
and
the
martiansa
diminishing
black
bulk
against
the
receding
horizontal
expanse
of
the
essex
coast

suddenly
the
foremost
martian
lowered
his
tube
and
discharged
a
canister
of
the
black
gas
at
the
ironclad

it
hit
her
larboard
side
and
glanced
off
in
an
inky
jet
that
rolled
away
to
seaward
an
unfolding
torrent
of
black
smoke
from
which
the
ironclad
drove
clear
to
the
watchers
from
the
steamer
low
in
the
water
and
with
the
sun
in
their
eyes
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
already
among
the
martians

they
saw
the
gaunt
figures
separating
and
rising
out
of
the
water
as
they
retreated
shoreward
and
one
of
them
raised
the
cameralike
generator
of
the
heatray

he
held
it
pointing
obliquely
downward
and
a
bank
of
steam
sprang
from
the
water
at
its
touch

it
must
have
driven
through
the
iron
of
the
ship's
side
like
a
whitehot
iron
rod
through
paper

a
flicker
of
flame
went
up
through
the
rising
steam
and
then
the
martian
reeled
and
staggered

in
another
moment
he
was
cut
down
and
a
great
body
of
water
and
steam
shot
high
in
the
air

the
guns
of
the
thunder
child
sounded
through
the
reek
going
off
one
after
the
other
and
one
shot
splashed
the
water
high
close
by
the
steamer
ricocheted
towards
the
other
flying
ships
to
the
north
and
smashed
a
smack
to
matchwood

but
no
one
heeded
that
very
much

at
the
sight
of
the
martian's
collapse
the
captain
on
the
bridge
yelled
inarticulately
and
all
the
crowding
passengers
on
the
steamer's
stern
shouted
together

and
then
they
yelled
again

for
surging
out
beyond
the
white
tumult
drove
something
long
and
black
the
flames
streaming
from
its
middle
parts
its
ventilators
and
funnels
spouting
fire

she
was
alive
still
the
steering
gear
it
seems
was
intact
and
her
engines
working

she
headed
straight
for
a
second
martian
and
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
when
the
heatray
came
to
bear

then
with
a
violent
thud
a
blinding
flash
her
decks
her
funnels
leaped
upward

the
martian
staggered
with
the
violence
of
her
explosion
and
in
another
moment
the
flaming
wreckage
still
driving
forward
with
the
impetus
of
its
pace
had
struck
him
and
crumpled
him
up
like
a
thing
of
cardboard

my
brother
shouted
involuntarily

a
boiling
tumult
of
steam
hid
everything
again

two
yelled
the
captain

everyone
was
shouting

the
whole
steamer
from
end
to
end
rang
with
frantic
cheering
that
was
taken
up
first
by
one
and
then
by
all
in
the
crowding
multitude
of
ships
and
boats
that
was
driving
out
to
sea

the
steam
hung
upon
the
water
for
many
minutes
hiding
the
third
martian
and
the
coast
altogether

and
all
this
time
the
boat
was
paddling
steadily
out
to
sea
and
away
from
the
fight
and
when
at
last
the
confusion
cleared
the
drifting
bank
of
black
vapour
intervened
and
nothing
of
the
thunder
child
could
be
made
out
nor
could
the
third
martian
be
seen

but
the
ironclads
to
seaward
were
now
quite
close
and
standing
in
towards
shore
past
the
steamboat

the
little
vessel
continued
to
beat
its
way
seaward
and
the
ironclads
receded
slowly
towards
the
coast
which
was
hidden
still
by
a
marbled
bank
of
vapour
part
steam
part
black
gas
eddying
and
combining
in
the
strangest
way

the
fleet
of
refugees
was
scattering
to
the
northeast
several
smacks
were
sailing
between
the
ironclads
and
the
steamboat

after
a
time
and
before
they
reached
the
sinking
cloud
bank
the
warships
turned
northward
and
then
abruptly
went
about
and
passed
into
the
thickening
haze
of
evening
southward

the
coast
grew
faint
and
at
last
indistinguishable
amid
the
low
banks
of
clouds
that
were
gathering
about
the
sinking
sun

then
suddenly
out
of
the
golden
haze
of
the
sunset
came
the
vibration
of
guns
and
a
form
of
black
shadows
moving

everyone
struggled
to
the
rail
of
the
steamer
and
peered
into
the
blinding
furnace
of
the
west
but
nothing
was
to
be
distinguished
clearly

a
mass
of
smoke
rose
slanting
and
barred
the
face
of
the
sun

the
steamboat
throbbed
on
its
way
through
an
interminable
suspense

the
sun
sank
into
grey
clouds
the
sky
flushed
and
darkened
the
evening
star
trembled
into
sight

it
was
deep
twilight
when
the
captain
cried
out
and
pointed

my
brother
strained
his
eyes
something
rushed
up
into
the
sky
out
of
the
greynessrushed
slantingly
upward
and
very
swiftly
into
the
luminous
clearness
above
the
clouds
in
the
western
sky
something
flat
and
broad
and
very
large
that
swept
round
in
a
vast
curve
grew
smaller
sank
slowly
and
vanished
again
into
the
grey
mystery
of
the
night

and
as
it
flew
it
rained
down
darkness
upon
the
land



book
two

the
earth
under
the
martians



chapter
one

under
foot


in
the
first
book
I
have
wandered
so
much
from
my
own
adventures
to
tell
of
the
experiences
of
my
brother
that
all
through
the
last
two
chapters
I
and
the
curate
have
been
lurking
in
the
empty
house
at
halliford
whither
we
fled
to
escape
the
black
smoke

there
I
will
resume

we
stopped
there
all
sunday
night
and
all
the
next
daythe
day
of
the
panicin
a
little
island
of
daylight
cut
off
by
the
black
smoke
from
the
rest
of
the
world

we
could
do
nothing
but
wait
in
aching
inactivity
during
those
two
weary
days

my
mind
was
occupied
by
anxiety
for
my
wife

I
figured
her
at
leatherhead
terrified
in
danger
mourning
me
already
as
a
dead
man
I
paced
the
rooms
and
cried
aloud
when
I
thought
of
how
I
was
cut
off
from
her
of
all
that
might
happen
to
her
in
my
absence

my
cousin
I
knew
was
brave
enough
for
any
emergency
but
he
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
realise
danger
quickly
to
rise
promptly

what
was
needed
now
was
not
bravery
but
circumspection

my
only
consolation
was
to
believe
that
the
martians
were
moving
londonward
and
away
from
her
such
vague
anxieties
keep
the
mind
sensitive
and
painful

I
grew
very
weary
and
irritable
with
the
curate's
perpetual
ejaculations
I
tired
of
the
sight
of
his
selfish
despair

after
some
ineffectual
remonstrance
I
kept
away
from
him
staying
in
a
roomevidently
a
children's
schoolroomcontaining
globes
forms
and
copybooks

when
he
followed
me
thither
I
went
to
a
box
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
in
order
to
be
alone
with
my
aching
miseries
locked
myself
in

we
were
hopelessly
hemmed
in
by
the
black
smoke
all
that
day
and
the
morning
of
the
next

there
were
signs
of
people
in
the
next
house
on
sunday
eveninga
face
at
a
window
and
moving
lights
and
later
the
slamming
of
a
door

but
I
do
not
know
who
these
people
were
nor
what
became
of
them

we
saw
nothing
of
them
next
day

the
black
smoke
drifted
slowly
riverward
all
through
monday
morning
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
to
us
driving
at
last
along
the
roadway
outside
the
house
that
hid
us

a
martian
came
across
the
fields
about
midday
laying
the
stuff
with
a
jet
of
superheated
steam
that
hissed
against
the
walls
smashed
all
the
windows
it
touched
and
scalded
the
curate's
hand
as
he
fled
out
of
the
front
room

when
at
last
we
crept
across
the
sodden
rooms
and
looked
out
again
the
country
northward
was
as
though
a
black
snowstorm
had
passed
over
it

looking
towards
the
river
we
were
astonished
to
see
an
unaccountable
redness
mingling
with
the
black
of
the
scorched
meadows

for
a
time
we
did
not
see
how
this
change
affected
our
position
save
that
we
were
relieved
of
our
fear
of
the
black
smoke

but
later
I
perceived
that
we
were
no
longer
hemmed
in
that
now
we
might
get
away

so
soon
as
I
realised
that
the
way
of
escape
was
open
my
dream
of
action
returned

but
the
curate
was
lethargic
unreasonable

we
are
safe
here
he
repeated
safe
here

I
resolved
to
leave
himwould
that
I
had

wiser
now
for
the
artilleryman's
teaching
I
sought
out
food
and
drink

I
had
found
oil
and
rags
for
my
burns
and
I
also
took
a
hat
and
a
flannel
shirt
that
I
found
in
one
of
the
bedrooms

when
it
was
clear
to
him
that
I
meant
to
go
alonehad
reconciled
myself
to
going
alonehe
suddenly
roused
himself
to
come

and
all
being
quiet
throughout
the
afternoon
we
started
about
five
o'clock
as
I
should
judge
along
the
blackened
road
to
sunbury

in
sunbury
and
at
intervals
along
the
road
were
dead
bodies
lying
in
contorted
attitudes
horses
as
well
as
men
overturned
carts
and
luggage
all
covered
thickly
with
black
dust

that
pall
of
cindery
powder
made
me
think
of
what
I
had
read
of
the
destruction
of
pompeii
we
got
to
hampton
court
without
misadventure
our
minds
full
of
strange
and
unfamiliar
appearances
and
at
hampton
court
our
eyes
were
relieved
to
find
a
patch
of
green
that
had
escaped
the
suffocating
drift

we
went
through
bushey
park
with
its
deer
going
to
and
fro
under
the
chestnuts
and
some
men
and
women
hurrying
in
the
distance
towards
hampton
and
so
we
came
to
twickenham

these
were
the
first
people
we
saw

away
across
the
road
the
woods
beyond
ham
and
petersham
were
still
afire

twickenham
was
uninjured
by
either
heatray
or
black
smoke
and
there
were
more
people
about
here
though
none
could
give
us
news
for
the
most
part
they
were
like
ourselves
taking
advantage
of
a
lull
to
shift
their
quarters

I
have
an
impression
that
many
of
the
houses
here
were
still
occupied
by
scared
inhabitants
too
frightened
even
for
flight

here
too
the
evidence
of
a
hasty
rout
was
abundant
along
the
road

I
remember
most
vividly
three
smashed
bicycles
in
a
heap
pounded
into
the
road
by
the
wheels
of
subsequent
carts

we
crossed
richmond
bridge
about
half
past
eight

we
hurried
across
the
exposed
bridge
of
course
but
I
noticed
floating
down
the
stream
a
number
of
red
masses
some
many
feet
across

I
did
not
know
what
these
werethere
was
no
time
for
scrutinyand
I
put
a
more
horrible
interpretation
on
them
than
they
deserved

here
again
on
the
surrey
side
were
black
dust
that
had
once
been
smoke
and
dead
bodiesa
heap
near
the
approach
to
the
station
but
we
had
no
glimpse
of
the
martians
until
we
were
some
way
towards
barnes

we
saw
in
the
blackened
distance
a
group
of
three
people
running
down
a
side
street
towards
the
river
but
otherwise
it
seemed
deserted

up
the
hill
richmond
town
was
burning
briskly
outside
the
town
of
richmond
there
was
no
trace
of
the
black
smoke

then
suddenly
as
we
approached
kew
came
a
number
of
people
running
and
the
upperworks
of
a
martian
fightingmachine
loomed
in
sight
over
the
housetops
not
a
hundred
yards
away
from
us

we
stood
aghast
at
our
danger
and
had
the
martian
looked
down
we
must
immediately
have
perished

we
were
so
terrified
that
we
dared
not
go
on
but
turned
aside
and
hid
in
a
shed
in
a
garden

there
the
curate
crouched
weeping
silently
and
refusing
to
stir
again

but
my
fixed
idea
of
reaching
leatherhead
would
not
let
me
rest
and
in
the
twilight
I
ventured
out
again

I
went
through
a
shrubbery
and
along
a
passage
beside
a
big
house
standing
in
its
own
grounds
and
so
emerged
upon
the
road
towards
kew

the
curate
I
left
in
the
shed
but
he
came
hurrying
after
me

that
second
start
was
the
most
foolhardy
thing
I
ever
did

for
it
was
manifest
the
martians
were
about
us

no
sooner
had
the
curate
overtaken
me
than
we
saw
either
the
fightingmachine
we
had
seen
before
or
another
far
away
across
the
meadows
in
the
direction
of
kew
lodge

four
or
five
little
black
figures
hurried
before
it
across
the
greengrey
of
the
field
and
in
a
moment
it
was
evident
this
martian
pursued
them

in
three
strides
he
was
among
them
and
they
ran
radiating
from
his
feet
in
all
directions

he
used
no
heatray
to
destroy
them
but
picked
them
up
one
by
one

apparently
he
tossed
them
into
the
great
metallic
carrier
which
projected
behind
him
much
as
a
workman's
basket
hangs
over
his
shoulder

it
was
the
first
time
I
realised
that
the
martians
might
have
any
other
purpose
than
destruction
with
defeated
humanity

we
stood
for
a
moment
petrified
then
turned
and
fled
through
a
gate
behind
us
into
a
walled
garden
fell
into
rather
than
found
a
fortunate
ditch
and
lay
there
scarce
daring
to
whisper
to
each
other
until
the
stars
were
out

I
suppose
it
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
before
we
gathered
courage
to
start
again
no
longer
venturing
into
the
road
but
sneaking
along
hedgerows
and
through
plantations
and
watching
keenly
through
the
darkness
he
on
the
right
and
I
on
the
left
for
the
martians
who
seemed
to
be
all
about
us

in
one
place
we
blundered
upon
a
scorched
and
blackened
area
now
cooling
and
ashen
and
a
number
of
scattered
dead
bodies
of
men
burned
horribly
about
the
heads
and
trunks
but
with
their
legs
and
boots
mostly
intact
and
of
dead
horses
fifty
feet
perhaps
behind
a
line
of
four
ripped
guns
and
smashed
gun
carriages

sheen
it
seemed
had
escaped
destruction
but
the
place
was
silent
and
deserted

here
we
happened
on
no
dead
though
the
night
was
too
dark
for
us
to
see
into
the
side
roads
of
the
place

in
sheen
my
companion
suddenly
complained
of
faintness
and
thirst
and
we
decided
to
try
one
of
the
houses

the
first
house
we
entered
after
a
little
difficulty
with
the
window
was
a
small
semidetached
villa
and
I
found
nothing
eatable
left
in
the
place
but
some
mouldy
cheese

there
was
however
water
to
drink
and
I
took
a
hatchet
which
promised
to
be
useful
in
our
next
housebreaking

we
then
crossed
to
a
place
where
the
road
turns
towards
mortlake
here
there
stood
a
white
house
within
a
walled
garden
and
in
the
pantry
of
this
domicile
we
found
a
store
of
foodtwo
loaves
of
bread
in
a
pan
an
uncooked
steak
and
the
half
of
a
ham

I
give
this
catalogue
so
precisely
because
as
it
happened
we
were
destined
to
subsist
upon
this
store
for
the
next
fortnight

bottled
beer
stood
under
a
shelf
and
there
were
two
bags
of
haricot
beans
and
some
limp
lettuces

this
pantry
opened
into
a
kind
of
washup
kitchen
and
in
this
was
firewood
there
was
also
a
cupboard
in
which
we
found
nearly
a
dozen
of
burgundy
tinned
soups
and
salmon
and
two
tins
of
biscuits

we
sat
in
the
adjacent
kitchen
in
the
darkfor
we
dared
not
strike
a
lightand
ate
bread
and
ham
and
drank
beer
out
of
the
same
bottle
the
curate
who
was
still
timorous
and
restless
was
now
oddly
enough
for
pushing
on
and
I
was
urging
him
to
keep
up
his
strength
by
eating
when
the
thing
happened
that
was
to
imprison
us

it
can't
be
midnight
yet
I
said
and
then
came
a
blinding
glare
of
vivid
green
light

everything
in
the
kitchen
leaped
out
clearly
visible
in
green
and
black
and
vanished
again

and
then
followed
such
a
concussion
as
I
have
never
heard
before
or
since

so
close
on
the
heels
of
this
as
to
seem
instantaneous
came
a
thud
behind
me
a
clash
of
glass
a
crash
and
rattle
of
falling
masonry
all
about
us
and
the
plaster
of
the
ceiling
came
down
upon
us
smashing
into
a
multitude
of
fragments
upon
our
heads

I
was
knocked
headlong
across
the
floor
against
the
oven
handle
and
stunned

I
was
insensible
for
a
long
time
the
curate
told
me
and
when
I
came
to
we
were
in
darkness
again
and
he
with
a
face
wet
as
I
found
afterwards
with
blood
from
a
cut
forehead
was
dabbing
water
over
me

for
some
time
I
could
not
recollect
what
had
happened

then
things
came
to
me
slowly

a
bruise
on
my
temple
asserted
itself

are
you
better
asked
the
curate
in
a
whisper

at
last
I
answered
him

I
sat
up

don't
move
he
said

the
floor
is
covered
with
smashed
crockery
from
the
dresser

you
can't
possibly
move
without
making
a
noise
and
I
fancy
they
are
outside

we
both
sat
quite
silent
so
that
we
could
scarcely
hear
each
other
breathing

everything
seemed
deadly
still
but
once
something
near
us
some
plaster
or
broken
brickwork
slid
down
with
a
rumbling
sound
outside
and
very
near
was
an
intermittent
metallic
rattle

that
said
the
curate
when
presently
it
happened
again

yes
I
said

but
what
is
it

a
martian
said
the
curate

I
listened
again

it
was
not
like
the
heatray
I
said
and
for
a
time
I
was
inclined
to
think
one
of
the
great
fightingmachines
had
stumbled
against
the
house
as
I
had
seen
one
stumble
against
the
tower
of
shepperton
church

our
situation
was
so
strange
and
incomprehensible
that
for
three
or
four
hours
until
the
dawn
came
we
scarcely
moved

and
then
the
light
filtered
in
not
through
the
window
which
remained
black
but
through
a
triangular
aperture
between
a
beam
and
a
heap
of
broken
bricks
in
the
wall
behind
us

the
interior
of
the
kitchen
we
now
saw
greyly
for
the
first
time

the
window
had
been
burst
in
by
a
mass
of
garden
mould
which
flowed
over
the
table
upon
which
we
had
been
sitting
and
lay
about
our
feet

outside
the
soil
was
banked
high
against
the
house

at
the
top
of
the
window
frame
we
could
see
an
uprooted
drainpipe

the
floor
was
littered
with
smashed
hardware
the
end
of
the
kitchen
towards
the
house
was
broken
into
and
since
the
daylight
shone
in
there
it
was
evident
the
greater
part
of
the
house
had
collapsed

contrasting
vividly
with
this
ruin
was
the
neat
dresser
stained
in
the
fashion
pale
green
and
with
a
number
of
copper
and
tin
vessels
below
it
the
wallpaper
imitating
blue
and
white
tiles
and
a
couple
of
coloured
supplements
fluttering
from
the
walls
above
the
kitchen
range

as
the
dawn
grew
clearer
we
saw
through
the
gap
in
the
wall
the
body
of
a
martian
standing
sentinel
I
suppose
over
the
still
glowing
cylinder

at
the
sight
of
that
we
crawled
as
circumspectly
as
possible
out
of
the
twilight
of
the
kitchen
into
the
darkness
of
the
scullery

abruptly
the
right
interpretation
dawned
upon
my
mind

the
fifth
cylinder
I
whispered
the
fifth
shot
from
mars
has
struck
this
house
and
buried
us
under
the
ruins

for
a
time
the
curate
was
silent
and
then
he
whispered

god
have
mercy
upon
us

I
heard
him
presently
whimpering
to
himself

save
for
that
sound
we
lay
quite
still
in
the
scullery
I
for
my
part
scarce
dared
breathe
and
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
faint
light
of
the
kitchen
door

I
could
just
see
the
curate's
face
a
dim
oval
shape
and
his
collar
and
cuffs

outside
there
began
a
metallic
hammering
then
a
violent
hooting
and
then
again
after
a
quiet
interval
a
hissing
like
the
hissing
of
an
engine

these
noises
for
the
most
part
problematical
continued
intermittently
and
seemed
if
anything
to
increase
in
number
as
time
wore
on

presently
a
measured
thudding
and
a
vibration
that
made
everything
about
us
quiver
and
the
vessels
in
the
pantry
ring
and
shift
began
and
continued

once
the
light
was
eclipsed
and
the
ghostly
kitchen
doorway
became
absolutely
dark

for
many
hours
we
must
have
crouched
there
silent
and
shivering
until
our
tired
attention
failed




at
last
I
found
myself
awake
and
very
hungry

I
am
inclined
to
believe
we
must
have
spent
the
greater
portion
of
a
day
before
that
awakening

my
hunger
was
at
a
stride
so
insistent
that
it
moved
me
to
action

I
told
the
curate
I
was
going
to
seek
food
and
felt
my
way
towards
the
pantry

he
made
me
no
answer
but
so
soon
as
I
began
eating
the
faint
noise
I
made
stirred
him
up
and
I
heard
him
crawling
after
me



chapter
two

what
we
saw
from
the
ruined
house


after
eating
we
crept
back
to
the
scullery
and
there
I
must
have
dozed
again
for
when
presently
I
looked
round
I
was
alone

the
thudding
vibration
continued
with
wearisome
persistence

I
whispered
for
the
curate
several
times
and
at
last
felt
my
way
to
the
door
of
the
kitchen

it
was
still
daylight
and
I
perceived
him
across
the
room
lying
against
the
triangular
hole
that
looked
out
upon
the
martians

his
shoulders
were
hunched
so
that
his
head
was
hidden
from
me

I
could
hear
a
number
of
noises
almost
like
those
in
an
engine
shed
and
the
place
rocked
with
that
beating
thud

through
the
aperture
in
the
wall
I
could
see
the
top
of
a
tree
touched
with
gold
and
the
warm
blue
of
a
tranquil
evening
sky

for
a
minute
or
so
I
remained
watching
the
curate
and
then
I
advanced
crouching
and
stepping
with
extreme
care
amid
the
broken
crockery
that
littered
the
floor

I
touched
the
curate's
leg
and
he
started
so
violently
that
a
mass
of
plaster
went
sliding
down
outside
and
fell
with
a
loud
impact

I
gripped
his
arm
fearing
he
might
cry
out
and
for
a
long
time
we
crouched
motionless

then
I
turned
to
see
how
much
of
our
rampart
remained

the
detachment
of
the
plaster
had
left
a
vertical
slit
open
in
the
debris
and
by
raising
myself
cautiously
across
a
beam
I
was
able
to
see
out
of
this
gap
into
what
had
been
overnight
a
quiet
suburban
roadway

vast
indeed
was
the
change
that
we
beheld

the
fifth
cylinder
must
have
fallen
right
into
the
midst
of
the
house
we
had
first
visited

the
building
had
vanished
completely
smashed
pulverised
and
dispersed
by
the
blow

the
cylinder
lay
now
far
beneath
the
original
foundationsdeep
in
a
hole
already
vastly
larger
than
the
pit
I
had
looked
into
at
woking

the
earth
all
round
it
had
splashed
under
that
tremendous
impactsplashed
is
the
only
wordand
lay
in
heaped
piles
that
hid
the
masses
of
the
adjacent
houses

it
had
behaved
exactly
like
mud
under
the
violent
blow
of
a
hammer

our
house
had
collapsed
backward
the
front
portion
even
on
the
ground
floor
had
been
destroyed
completely
by
a
chance
the
kitchen
and
scullery
had
escaped
and
stood
buried
now
under
soil
and
ruins
closed
in
by
tons
of
earth
on
every
side
save
towards
the
cylinder

over
that
aspect
we
hung
now
on
the
very
edge
of
the
great
circular
pit
the
martians
were
engaged
in
making

the
heavy
beating
sound
was
evidently
just
behind
us
and
ever
and
again
a
bright
green
vapour
drove
up
like
a
veil
across
our
peephole

the
cylinder
was
already
opened
in
the
centre
of
the
pit
and
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
pit
amid
the
smashed
and
gravelheaped
shrubbery
one
of
the
great
fightingmachines
deserted
by
its
occupant
stood
stiff
and
tall
against
the
evening
sky

at
first
I
scarcely
noticed
the
pit
and
the
cylinder
although
it
has
been
convenient
to
describe
them
first
on
account
of
the
extraordinary
glittering
mechanism
I
saw
busy
in
the
excavation
and
on
account
of
the
strange
creatures
that
were
crawling
slowly
and
painfully
across
the
heaped
mould
near
it

the
mechanism
it
certainly
was
that
held
my
attention
first

it
was
one
of
those
complicated
fabrics
that
have
since
been
called
handlingmachines
and
the
study
of
which
has
already
given
such
an
enormous
impetus
to
terrestrial
invention

as
it
dawned
upon
me
first
it
presented
a
sort
of
metallic
spider
with
five
jointed
agile
legs
and
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
jointed
levers
bars
and
reaching
and
clutching
tentacles
about
its
body

most
of
its
arms
were
retracted
but
with
three
long
tentacles
it
was
fishing
out
a
number
of
rods
plates
and
bars
which
lined
the
covering
and
apparently
strengthened
the
walls
of
the
cylinder

these
as
it
extracted
them
were
lifted
out
and
deposited
upon
a
level
surface
of
earth
behind
it

its
motion
was
so
swift
complex
and
perfect
that
at
first
I
did
not
see
it
as
a
machine
in
spite
of
its
metallic
glitter

the
fightingmachines
were
coordinated
and
animated
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
but
nothing
to
compare
with
this

people
who
have
never
seen
these
structures
and
have
only
the
illimagined
efforts
of
artists
or
the
imperfect
descriptions
of
such
eyewitnesses
as
myself
to
go
upon
scarcely
realise
that
living
quality

I
recall
particularly
the
illustration
of
one
of
the
first
pamphlets
to
give
a
consecutive
account
of
the
war

the
artist
had
evidently
made
a
hasty
study
of
one
of
the
fightingmachines
and
there
his
knowledge
ended

he
presented
them
as
tilted
stiff
tripods
without
either
flexibility
or
subtlety
and
with
an
altogether
misleading
monotony
of
effect

the
pamphlet
containing
these
renderings
had
a
considerable
vogue
and
I
mention
them
here
simply
to
warn
the
reader
against
the
impression
they
may
have
created

they
were
no
more
like
the
martians
I
saw
in
action
than
a
dutch
doll
is
like
a
human
being

to
my
mind
the
pamphlet
would
have
been
much
better
without
them

at
first
I
say
the
handlingmachine
did
not
impress
me
as
a
machine
but
as
a
crablike
creature
with
a
glittering
integument
the
controlling
martian
whose
delicate
tentacles
actuated
its
movements
seeming
to
be
simply
the
equivalent
of
the
crab's
cerebral
portion
but
then
I
perceived
the
resemblance
of
its
greybrown
shiny
leathery
integument
to
that
of
the
other
sprawling
bodies
beyond
and
the
true
nature
of
this
dexterous
workman
dawned
upon
me

with
that
realisation
my
interest
shifted
to
those
other
creatures
the
real
martians

already
I
had
had
a
transient
impression
of
these
and
the
first
nausea
no
longer
obscured
my
observation

moreover
I
was
concealed
and
motionless
and
under
no
urgency
of
action

they
were
I
now
saw
the
most
unearthly
creatures
it
is
possible
to
conceive

they
were
huge
round
bodiesor
rather
headsabout
four
feet
in
diameter
each
body
having
in
front
of
it
a
face

this
face
had
no
nostrilsindeed
the
martians
do
not
seem
to
have
had
any
sense
of
smell
but
it
had
a
pair
of
very
large
darkcoloured
eyes
and
just
beneath
this
a
kind
of
fleshy
beak

in
the
back
of
this
head
or
bodyi
scarcely
know
how
to
speak
of
itwas
the
single
tight
tympanic
surface
since
known
to
be
anatomically
an
ear
though
it
must
have
been
almost
useless
in
our
dense
air

in
a
group
round
the
mouth
were
sixteen
slender
almost
whiplike
tentacles
arranged
in
two
bunches
of
eight
each

these
bunches
have
since
been
named
rather
aptly
by
that
distinguished
anatomist
professor
howes
the
hands
even
as
I
saw
these
martians
for
the
first
time
they
seemed
to
be
endeavouring
to
raise
themselves
on
these
hands
but
of
course
with
the
increased
weight
of
terrestrial
conditions
this
was
impossible
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
on
mars
they
may
have
progressed
upon
them
with
some
facility

the
internal
anatomy
I
may
remark
here
as
dissection
has
since
shown
was
almost
equally
simple

the
greater
part
of
the
structure
was
the
brain
sending
enormous
nerves
to
the
eyes
ear
and
tactile
tentacles

besides
this
were
the
bulky
lungs
into
which
the
mouth
opened
and
the
heart
and
its
vessels

the
pulmonary
distress
caused
by
the
denser
atmosphere
and
greater
gravitational
attraction
was
only
too
evident
in
the
convulsive
movements
of
the
outer
skin

and
this
was
the
sum
of
the
martian
organs

strange
as
it
may
seem
to
a
human
being
all
the
complex
apparatus
of
digestion
which
makes
up
the
bulk
of
our
bodies
did
not
exist
in
the
martians

they
were
headsmerely
heads

entrails
they
had
none

they
did
not
eat
much
less
digest

instead
they
took
the
fresh
living
blood
of
other
creatures
and
injected
it
into
their
own
veins

I
have
myself
seen
this
being
done
as
I
shall
mention
in
its
place

but
squeamish
as
I
may
seem
I
cannot
bring
myself
to
describe
what
I
could
not
endure
even
to
continue
watching

let
it
suffice
to
say
blood
obtained
from
a
still
living
animal
in
most
cases
from
a
human
being
was
run
directly
by
means
of
a
little
pipette
into
the
recipient
canal




the
bare
idea
of
this
is
no
doubt
horribly
repulsive
to
us
but
at
the
same
time
I
think
that
we
should
remember
how
repulsive
our
carnivorous
habits
would
seem
to
an
intelligent
rabbit

the
physiological
advantages
of
the
practice
of
injection
are
undeniable
if
one
thinks
of
the
tremendous
waste
of
human
time
and
energy
occasioned
by
eating
and
the
digestive
process

our
bodies
are
half
made
up
of
glands
and
tubes
and
organs
occupied
in
turning
heterogeneous
food
into
blood

the
digestive
processes
and
their
reaction
upon
the
nervous
system
sap
our
strength
and
colour
our
minds

men
go
happy
or
miserable
as
they
have
healthy
or
unhealthy
livers
or
sound
gastric
glands

but
the
martians
were
lifted
above
all
these
organic
fluctuations
of
mood
and
emotion

their
undeniable
preference
for
men
as
their
source
of
nourishment
is
partly
explained
by
the
nature
of
the
remains
of
the
victims
they
had
brought
with
them
as
provisions
from
mars

these
creatures
to
judge
from
the
shrivelled
remains
that
have
fallen
into
human
hands
were
bipeds
with
flimsy
silicious
skeletons
almost
like
those
of
the
silicious
sponges
and
feeble
musculature
standing
about
six
feet
high
and
having
round
erect
heads
and
large
eyes
in
flinty
sockets
two
or
three
of
these
seem
to
have
been
brought
in
each
cylinder
and
all
were
killed
before
earth
was
reached

it
was
just
as
well
for
them
for
the
mere
attempt
to
stand
upright
upon
our
planet
would
have
broken
every
bone
in
their
bodies

and
while
I
am
engaged
in
this
description
I
may
add
in
this
place
certain
further
details
which
although
they
were
not
all
evident
to
us
at
the
time
will
enable
the
reader
who
is
unacquainted
with
them
to
form
a
clearer
picture
of
these
offensive
creatures

in
three
other
points
their
physiology
differed
strangely
from
ours

their
organisms
did
not
sleep
any
more
than
the
heart
of
man
sleeps

since
they
had
no
extensive
muscular
mechanism
to
recuperate
that
periodical
extinction
was
unknown
to
them

they
had
little
or
no
sense
of
fatigue
it
would
seem

on
earth
they
could
never
have
moved
without
effort
yet
even
to
the
last
they
kept
in
action

in
twentyfour
hours
they
did
twentyfour
hours
of
work
as
even
on
earth
is
perhaps
the
case
with
the
ants

in
the
next
place
wonderful
as
it
seems
in
a
sexual
world
the
martians
were
absolutely
without
sex
and
therefore
without
any
of
the
tumultuous
emotions
that
arise
from
that
difference
among
men

a
young
martian
there
can
now
be
no
dispute
was
really
born
upon
earth
during
the
war
and
it
was
found
attached
to
its
parent
partially
budded
off
just
as
young
lilybulbs
bud
off
or
like
the
young
animals
in
the
freshwater
polyp

in
man
in
all
the
higher
terrestrial
animals
such
a
method
of
increase
has
disappeared
but
even
on
this
earth
it
was
certainly
the
primitive
method

among
the
lower
animals
up
even
to
those
first
cousins
of
the
vertebrated
animals
the
tunicates
the
two
processes
occur
side
by
side
but
finally
the
sexual
method
superseded
its
competitor
altogether

on
mars
however
just
the
reverse
has
apparently
been
the
case

it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
a
certain
speculative
writer
of
quasiscientific
repute
writing
long
before
the
martian
invasion
did
forecast
for
man
a
final
structure
not
unlike
the
actual
martian
condition

his
prophecy
I
remember
appeared
in
november
or
december
1893
in
a
longdefunct
publication
the
pall
mall
budget
and
I
recall
a
caricature
of
it
in
a
premartian
periodical
called
punch

he
pointed
outwriting
in
a
foolish
facetious
tonethat
the
perfection
of
mechanical
appliances
must
ultimately
supersede
limbs
the
perfection
of
chemical
devices
digestion
that
such
organs
as
hair
external
nose
teeth
ears
and
chin
were
no
longer
essential
parts
of
the
human
being
and
that
the
tendency
of
natural
selection
would
lie
in
the
direction
of
their
steady
diminution
through
the
coming
ages

the
brain
alone
remained
a
cardinal
necessity

only
one
other
part
of
the
body
had
a
strong
case
for
survival
and
that
was
the
hand
teacher
and
agent
of
the
brain

while
the
rest
of
the
body
dwindled
the
hands
would
grow
larger

there
is
many
a
true
word
written
in
jest
and
here
in
the
martians
we
have
beyond
dispute
the
actual
accomplishment
of
such
a
suppression
of
the
animal
side
of
the
organism
by
the
intelligence

to
me
it
is
quite
credible
that
the
martians
may
be
descended
from
beings
not
unlike
ourselves
by
a
gradual
development
of
brain
and
hands
the
latter
giving
rise
to
the
two
bunches
of
delicate
tentacles
at
last
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
of
the
body

without
the
body
the
brain
would
of
course
become
a
mere
selfish
intelligence
without
any
of
the
emotional
substratum
of
the
human
being

the
last
salient
point
in
which
the
systems
of
these
creatures
differed
from
ours
was
in
what
one
might
have
thought
a
very
trivial
particular

microorganisms
which
cause
so
much
disease
and
pain
on
earth
have
either
never
appeared
upon
mars
or
martian
sanitary
science
eliminated
them
ages
ago

a
hundred
diseases
all
the
fevers
and
contagions
of
human
life
consumption
cancers
tumours
and
such
morbidities
never
enter
the
scheme
of
their
life

and
speaking
of
the
differences
between
the
life
on
mars
and
terrestrial
life
I
may
allude
here
to
the
curious
suggestions
of
the
red
weed

apparently
the
vegetable
kingdom
in
mars
instead
of
having
green
for
a
dominant
colour
is
of
a
vivid
bloodred
tint

at
any
rate
the
seeds
which
the
martians
intentionally
or
accidentally
brought
with
them
gave
rise
in
all
cases
to
redcoloured
growths

only
that
known
popularly
as
the
red
weed
however
gained
any
footing
in
competition
with
terrestrial
forms

the
red
creeper
was
quite
a
transitory
growth
and
few
people
have
seen
it
growing

for
a
time
however
the
red
weed
grew
with
astonishing
vigour
and
luxuriance

it
spread
up
the
sides
of
the
pit
by
the
third
or
fourth
day
of
our
imprisonment
and
its
cactuslike
branches
formed
a
carmine
fringe
to
the
edges
of
our
triangular
window

and
afterwards
I
found
it
broadcast
throughout
the
country
and
especially
wherever
there
was
a
stream
of
water

the
martians
had
what
appears
to
have
been
an
auditory
organ
a
single
round
drum
at
the
back
of
the
headbody
and
eyes
with
a
visual
range
not
very
different
from
ours
except
that
according
to
philips
blue
and
violet
were
as
black
to
them

it
is
commonly
supposed
that
they
communicated
by
sounds
and
tentacular
gesticulations
this
is
asserted
for
instance
in
the
able
but
hastily
compiled
pamphlet
written
evidently
by
someone
not
an
eyewitness
of
martian
actions
to
which
I
have
already
alluded
and
which
so
far
has
been
the
chief
source
of
information
concerning
them

now
no
surviving
human
being
saw
so
much
of
the
martians
in
action
as
I
did

I
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
an
accident
but
the
fact
is
so

and
I
assert
that
I
watched
them
closely
time
after
time
and
that
I
have
seen
four
five
and
once
six
of
them
sluggishly
performing
the
most
elaborately
complicated
operations
together
without
either
sound
or
gesture

their
peculiar
hooting
invariably
preceded
feeding
it
had
no
modulation
and
was
I
believe
in
no
sense
a
signal
but
merely
the
expiration
of
air
preparatory
to
the
suctional
operation

I
have
a
certain
claim
to
at
least
an
elementary
knowledge
of
psychology
and
in
this
matter
I
am
convincedas
firmly
as
I
am
convinced
of
anythingthat
the
martians
interchanged
thoughts
without
any
physical
intermediation
and
I
have
been
convinced
of
this
in
spite
of
strong
preconceptions
before
the
martian
invasion
as
an
occasional
reader
here
or
there
may
remember
I
had
written
with
some
little
vehemence
against
the
telepathic
theory

the
martians
wore
no
clothing

their
conceptions
of
ornament
and
decorum
were
necessarily
different
from
ours
and
not
only
were
they
evidently
much
less
sensible
of
changes
of
temperature
than
we
are
but
changes
of
pressure
do
not
seem
to
have
affected
their
health
at
all
seriously

yet
though
they
wore
no
clothing
it
was
in
the
other
artificial
additions
to
their
bodily
resources
that
their
great
superiority
over
man
lay

we
men
with
our
bicycles
and
roadskates
our
lilienthal
soaringmachines
our
guns
and
sticks
and
so
forth
are
just
in
the
beginning
of
the
evolution
that
the
martians
have
worked
out

they
have
become
practically
mere
brains
wearing
different
bodies
according
to
their
needs
just
as
men
wear
suits
of
clothes
and
take
a
bicycle
in
a
hurry
or
an
umbrella
in
the
wet

and
of
their
appliances
perhaps
nothing
is
more
wonderful
to
a
man
than
the
curious
fact
that
what
is
the
dominant
feature
of
almost
all
human
devices
in
mechanism
is
absentthe
wheel
is
absent
among
all
the
things
they
brought
to
earth
there
is
no
trace
or
suggestion
of
their
use
of
wheels

one
would
have
at
least
expected
it
in
locomotion

and
in
this
connection
it
is
curious
to
remark
that
even
on
this
earth
nature
has
never
hit
upon
the
wheel
or
has
preferred
other
expedients
to
its
development

and
not
only
did
the
martians
either
not
know
of
which
is
incredible
or
abstain
from
the
wheel
but
in
their
apparatus
singularly
little
use
is
made
of
the
fixed
pivot
or
relatively
fixed
pivot
with
circular
motions
thereabout
confined
to
one
plane

almost
all
the
joints
of
the
machinery
present
a
complicated
system
of
sliding
parts
moving
over
small
but
beautifully
curved
friction
bearings

and
while
upon
this
matter
of
detail
it
is
remarkable
that
the
long
leverages
of
their
machines
are
in
most
cases
actuated
by
a
sort
of
sham
musculature
of
the
disks
in
an
elastic
sheath
these
disks
become
polarised
and
drawn
closely
and
powerfully
together
when
traversed
by
a
current
of
electricity

in
this
way
the
curious
parallelism
to
animal
motions
which
was
so
striking
and
disturbing
to
the
human
beholder
was
attained

such
quasimuscles
abounded
in
the
crablike
handlingmachine
which
on
my
first
peeping
out
of
the
slit
I
watched
unpacking
the
cylinder

it
seemed
infinitely
more
alive
than
the
actual
martians
lying
beyond
it
in
the
sunset
light
panting
stirring
ineffectual
tentacles
and
moving
feebly
after
their
vast
journey
across
space

while
I
was
still
watching
their
sluggish
motions
in
the
sunlight
and
noting
each
strange
detail
of
their
form
the
curate
reminded
me
of
his
presence
by
pulling
violently
at
my
arm

I
turned
to
a
scowling
face
and
silent
eloquent
lips

he
wanted
the
slit
which
permitted
only
one
of
us
to
peep
through
and
so
I
had
to
forego
watching
them
for
a
time
while
he
enjoyed
that
privilege

when
I
looked
again
the
busy
handlingmachine
had
already
put
together
several
of
the
pieces
of
apparatus
it
had
taken
out
of
the
cylinder
into
a
shape
having
an
unmistakable
likeness
to
its
own
and
down
on
the
left
a
busy
little
digging
mechanism
had
come
into
view
emitting
jets
of
green
vapour
and
working
its
way
round
the
pit
excavating
and
embanking
in
a
methodical
and
discriminating
manner
this
it
was
which
had
caused
the
regular
beating
noise
and
the
rhythmic
shocks
that
had
kept
our
ruinous
refuge
quivering

it
piped
and
whistled
as
it
worked

so
far
as
I
could
see
the
thing
was
without
a
directing
martian
at
all



chapter
three

the
days
of
imprisonment


the
arrival
of
a
second
fightingmachine
drove
us
from
our
peephole
into
the
scullery
for
we
feared
that
from
his
elevation
the
martian
might
see
down
upon
us
behind
our
barrier

at
a
later
date
we
began
to
feel
less
in
danger
of
their
eyes
for
to
an
eye
in
the
dazzle
of
the
sunlight
outside
our
refuge
must
have
been
blank
blackness
but
at
first
the
slightest
suggestion
of
approach
drove
us
into
the
scullery
in
heartthrobbing
retreat

yet
terrible
as
was
the
danger
we
incurred
the
attraction
of
peeping
was
for
both
of
us
irresistible
and
I
recall
now
with
a
sort
of
wonder
that
in
spite
of
the
infinite
danger
in
which
we
were
between
starvation
and
a
still
more
terrible
death
we
could
yet
struggle
bitterly
for
that
horrible
privilege
of
sight

we
would
race
across
the
kitchen
in
a
grotesque
way
between
eagerness
and
the
dread
of
making
a
noise
and
strike
each
other
and
thrust
and
kick
within
a
few
inches
of
exposure

the
fact
is
that
we
had
absolutely
incompatible
dispositions
and
habits
of
thought
and
action
and
our
danger
and
isolation
only
accentuated
the
incompatibility

at
halliford
I
had
already
come
to
hate
the
curate's
trick
of
helpless
exclamation
his
stupid
rigidity
of
mind

his
endless
muttering
monologue
vitiated
every
effort
I
made
to
think
out
a
line
of
action
and
drove
me
at
times
thus
pent
up
and
intensified
almost
to
the
verge
of
craziness

he
was
as
lacking
in
restraint
as
a
silly
woman

he
would
weep
for
hours
together
and
I
verily
believe
that
to
the
very
end
this
spoiled
child
of
life
thought
his
weak
tears
in
some
way
efficacious

and
I
would
sit
in
the
darkness
unable
to
keep
my
mind
off
him
by
reason
of
his
importunities

he
ate
more
than
I
did
and
it
was
in
vain
I
pointed
out
that
our
only
chance
of
life
was
to
stop
in
the
house
until
the
martians
had
done
with
their
pit
that
in
that
long
patience
a
time
might
presently
come
when
we
should
need
food

he
ate
and
drank
impulsively
in
heavy
meals
at
long
intervals

he
slept
little

as
the
days
wore
on
his
utter
carelessness
of
any
consideration
so
intensified
our
distress
and
danger
that
I
had
much
as
I
loathed
doing
it
to
resort
to
threats
and
at
last
to
blows

that
brought
him
to
reason
for
a
time

but
he
was
one
of
those
weak
creatures
void
of
pride
timorous
anaemic
hateful
souls
full
of
shifty
cunning
who
face
neither
god
nor
man
who
face
not
even
themselves

it
is
disagreeable
for
me
to
recall
and
write
these
things
but
I
set
them
down
that
my
story
may
lack
nothing

those
who
have
escaped
the
dark
and
terrible
aspects
of
life
will
find
my
brutality
my
flash
of
rage
in
our
final
tragedy
easy
enough
to
blame
for
they
know
what
is
wrong
as
well
as
any
but
not
what
is
possible
to
tortured
men

but
those
who
have
been
under
the
shadow
who
have
gone
down
at
last
to
elemental
things
will
have
a
wider
charity

and
while
within
we
fought
out
our
dark
dim
contest
of
whispers
snatched
food
and
drink
and
gripping
hands
and
blows
without
in
the
pitiless
sunlight
of
that
terrible
june
was
the
strange
wonder
the
unfamiliar
routine
of
the
martians
in
the
pit

let
me
return
to
those
first
new
experiences
of
mine

after
a
long
time
I
ventured
back
to
the
peephole
to
find
that
the
newcomers
had
been
reinforced
by
the
occupants
of
no
fewer
than
three
of
the
fightingmachines

these
last
had
brought
with
them
certain
fresh
appliances
that
stood
in
an
orderly
manner
about
the
cylinder

the
second
handlingmachine
was
now
completed
and
was
busied
in
serving
one
of
the
novel
contrivances
the
big
machine
had
brought

this
was
a
body
resembling
a
milk
can
in
its
general
form
above
which
oscillated
a
pearshaped
receptacle
and
from
which
a
stream
of
white
powder
flowed
into
a
circular
basin
below

the
oscillatory
motion
was
imparted
to
this
by
one
tentacle
of
the
handlingmachine

with
two
spatulate
hands
the
handlingmachine
was
digging
out
and
flinging
masses
of
clay
into
the
pearshaped
receptacle
above
while
with
another
arm
it
periodically
opened
a
door
and
removed
rusty
and
blackened
clinkers
from
the
middle
part
of
the
machine

another
steely
tentacle
directed
the
powder
from
the
basin
along
a
ribbed
channel
towards
some
receiver
that
was
hidden
from
me
by
the
mound
of
bluish
dust

from
this
unseen
receiver
a
little
thread
of
green
smoke
rose
vertically
into
the
quiet
air

as
I
looked
the
handlingmachine
with
a
faint
and
musical
clinking
extended
telescopic
fashion
a
tentacle
that
had
been
a
moment
before
a
mere
blunt
projection
until
its
end
was
hidden
behind
the
mound
of
clay
in
another
second
it
had
lifted
a
bar
of
white
aluminium
into
sight
untarnished
as
yet
and
shining
dazzlingly
and
deposited
it
in
a
growing
stack
of
bars
that
stood
at
the
side
of
the
pit

between
sunset
and
starlight
this
dexterous
machine
must
have
made
more
than
a
hundred
such
bars
out
of
the
crude
clay
and
the
mound
of
bluish
dust
rose
steadily
until
it
topped
the
side
of
the
pit

the
contrast
between
the
swift
and
complex
movements
of
these
contrivances
and
the
inert
panting
clumsiness
of
their
masters
was
acute
and
for
days
I
had
to
tell
myself
repeatedly
that
these
latter
were
indeed
the
living
of
the
two
things

the
curate
had
possession
of
the
slit
when
the
first
men
were
brought
to
the
pit

I
was
sitting
below
huddled
up
listening
with
all
my
ears

he
made
a
sudden
movement
backward
and
I
fearful
that
we
were
observed
crouched
in
a
spasm
of
terror

he
came
sliding
down
the
rubbish
and
crept
beside
me
in
the
darkness
inarticulate
gesticulating
and
for
a
moment
I
shared
his
panic

his
gesture
suggested
a
resignation
of
the
slit
and
after
a
little
while
my
curiosity
gave
me
courage
and
I
rose
up
stepped
across
him
and
clambered
up
to
it

at
first
I
could
see
no
reason
for
his
frantic
behaviour

the
twilight
had
now
come
the
stars
were
little
and
faint
but
the
pit
was
illuminated
by
the
flickering
green
fire
that
came
from
the
aluminiummaking

the
whole
picture
was
a
flickering
scheme
of
green
gleams
and
shifting
rusty
black
shadows
strangely
trying
to
the
eyes

over
and
through
it
all
went
the
bats
heeding
it
not
at
all

the
sprawling
martians
were
no
longer
to
be
seen
the
mound
of
bluegreen
powder
had
risen
to
cover
them
from
sight
and
a
fightingmachine
with
its
legs
contracted
crumpled
and
abbreviated
stood
across
the
corner
of
the
pit

and
then
amid
the
clangour
of
the
machinery
came
a
drifting
suspicion
of
human
voices
that
I
entertained
at
first
only
to
dismiss

I
crouched
watching
this
fightingmachine
closely
satisfying
myself
now
for
the
first
time
that
the
hood
did
indeed
contain
a
martian

as
the
green
flames
lifted
I
could
see
the
oily
gleam
of
his
integument
and
the
brightness
of
his
eyes

and
suddenly
I
heard
a
yell
and
saw
a
long
tentacle
reaching
over
the
shoulder
of
the
machine
to
the
little
cage
that
hunched
upon
its
back

then
somethingsomething
struggling
violentlywas
lifted
high
against
the
sky
a
black
vague
enigma
against
the
starlight
and
as
this
black
object
came
down
again
I
saw
by
the
green
brightness
that
it
was
a
man

for
an
instant
he
was
clearly
visible

he
was
a
stout
ruddy
middleaged
man
well
dressed
three
days
before
he
must
have
been
walking
the
world
a
man
of
considerable
consequence

I
could
see
his
staring
eyes
and
gleams
of
light
on
his
studs
and
watch
chain

he
vanished
behind
the
mound
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence

and
then
began
a
shrieking
and
a
sustained
and
cheerful
hooting
from
the
martians

I
slid
down
the
rubbish
struggled
to
my
feet
clapped
my
hands
over
my
ears
and
bolted
into
the
scullery

the
curate
who
had
been
crouching
silently
with
his
arms
over
his
head
looked
up
as
I
passed
cried
out
quite
loudly
at
my
desertion
of
him
and
came
running
after
me

that
night
as
we
lurked
in
the
scullery
balanced
between
our
horror
and
the
terrible
fascination
this
peeping
had
although
I
felt
an
urgent
need
of
action
I
tried
in
vain
to
conceive
some
plan
of
escape
but
afterwards
during
the
second
day
I
was
able
to
consider
our
position
with
great
clearness

the
curate
I
found
was
quite
incapable
of
discussion
this
new
and
culminating
atrocity
had
robbed
him
of
all
vestiges
of
reason
or
forethought

practically
he
had
already
sunk
to
the
level
of
an
animal

but
as
the
saying
goes
I
gripped
myself
with
both
hands

it
grew
upon
my
mind
once
I
could
face
the
facts
that
terrible
as
our
position
was
there
was
as
yet
no
justification
for
absolute
despair

our
chief
chance
lay
in
the
possibility
of
the
martians
making
the
pit
nothing
more
than
a
temporary
encampment

or
even
if
they
kept
it
permanently
they
might
not
consider
it
necessary
to
guard
it
and
a
chance
of
escape
might
be
afforded
us

I
also
weighed
very
carefully
the
possibility
of
our
digging
a
way
out
in
a
direction
away
from
the
pit
but
the
chances
of
our
emerging
within
sight
of
some
sentinel
fightingmachine
seemed
at
first
too
great

and
I
should
have
had
to
do
all
the
digging
myself
the
curate
would
certainly
have
failed
me

it
was
on
the
third
day
if
my
memory
serves
me
right
that
I
saw
the
lad
killed

it
was
the
only
occasion
on
which
I
actually
saw
the
martians
feed

after
that
experience
I
avoided
the
hole
in
the
wall
for
the
better
part
of
a
day

I
went
into
the
scullery
removed
the
door
and
spent
some
hours
digging
with
my
hatchet
as
silently
as
possible
but
when
I
had
made
a
hole
about
a
couple
of
feet
deep
the
loose
earth
collapsed
noisily
and
I
did
not
dare
continue

I
lost
heart
and
lay
down
on
the
scullery
floor
for
a
long
time
having
no
spirit
even
to
move

and
after
that
I
abandoned
altogether
the
idea
of
escaping
by
excavation

it
says
much
for
the
impression
the
martians
had
made
upon
me
that
at
first
I
entertained
little
or
no
hope
of
our
escape
being
brought
about
by
their
overthrow
through
any
human
effort

but
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
night
I
heard
a
sound
like
heavy
guns

it
was
very
late
in
the
night
and
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
the
martians
had
taken
away
the
excavatingmachine
and
save
for
a
fightingmachine
that
stood
in
the
remoter
bank
of
the
pit
and
a
handlingmachine
that
was
buried
out
of
my
sight
in
a
corner
of
the
pit
immediately
beneath
my
peephole
the
place
was
deserted
by
them
except
for
the
pale
glow
from
the
handlingmachine
and
the
bars
and
patches
of
white
moonlight
the
pit
was
in
darkness
and
except
for
the
clinking
of
the
handlingmachine
quite
still

that
night
was
a
beautiful
serenity
save
for
one
planet
the
moon
seemed
to
have
the
sky
to
herself

I
heard
a
dog
howling
and
that
familiar
sound
it
was
that
made
me
listen

then
I
heard
quite
distinctly
a
booming
exactly
like
the
sound
of
great
guns

six
distinct
reports
I
counted
and
after
a
long
interval
six
again

and
that
was
all



chapter
four

the
death
of
the
curate


it
was
on
the
sixth
day
of
our
imprisonment
that
I
peeped
for
the
last
time
and
presently
found
myself
alone

instead
of
keeping
close
to
me
and
trying
to
oust
me
from
the
slit
the
curate
had
gone
back
into
the
scullery

I
was
struck
by
a
sudden
thought

I
went
back
quickly
and
quietly
into
the
scullery

in
the
darkness
I
heard
the
curate
drinking

I
snatched
in
the
darkness
and
my
fingers
caught
a
bottle
of
burgundy

for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
tussle

the
bottle
struck
the
floor
and
broke
and
I
desisted
and
rose

we
stood
panting
and
threatening
each
other

in
the
end
I
planted
myself
between
him
and
the
food
and
told
him
of
my
determination
to
begin
a
discipline

I
divided
the
food
in
the
pantry
into
rations
to
last
us
ten
days

I
would
not
let
him
eat
any
more
that
day

in
the
afternoon
he
made
a
feeble
effort
to
get
at
the
food

I
had
been
dozing
but
in
an
instant
I
was
awake
all
day
and
all
night
we
sat
face
to
face
I
weary
but
resolute
and
he
weeping
and
complaining
of
his
immediate
hunger

it
was
I
know
a
night
and
a
day
but
to
me
it
seemedit
seems
nowan
interminable
length
of
time

and
so
our
widened
incompatibility
ended
at
last
in
open
conflict
for
two
vast
days
we
struggled
in
undertones
and
wrestling
contests
there
were
times
when
I
beat
and
kicked
him
madly
times
when
I
cajoled
and
persuaded
him
and
once
I
tried
to
bribe
him
with
the
last
bottle
of
burgundy
for
there
was
a
rainwater
pump
from
which
I
could
get
water

but
neither
force
nor
kindness
availed
he
was
indeed
beyond
reason

he
would
neither
desist
from
his
attacks
on
the
food
nor
from
his
noisy
babbling
to
himself

the
rudimentary
precautions
to
keep
our
imprisonment
endurable
he
would
not
observe

slowly
I
began
to
realise
the
complete
overthrow
of
his
intelligence
to
perceive
that
my
sole
companion
in
this
close
and
sickly
darkness
was
a
man
insane

from
certain
vague
memories
I
am
inclined
to
think
my
own
mind
wandered
at
times

I
had
strange
and
hideous
dreams
whenever
I
slept
it
sounds
paradoxical
but
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
weakness
and
insanity
of
the
curate
warned
me
braced
me
and
kept
me
a
sane
man

on
the
eighth
day
he
began
to
talk
aloud
instead
of
whispering
and
nothing
I
could
do
would
moderate
his
speech

it
is
just
o
god
he
would
say
over
and
over
again
it
is
just

on
me
and
mine
be
the
punishment
laid

we
have
sinned
we
have
fallen
short

there
was
poverty
sorrow
the
poor
were
trodden
in
the
dust
and
I
held
my
peace

I
preached
acceptable
follymy
god
what
follywhen
I
should
have
stood
up
though
I
died
for
it
and
called
upon
them
to
repentrepent




oppressors
of
the
poor
and
needy





the
wine
press
of
god

then
he
would
suddenly
revert
to
the
matter
of
the
food
I
withheld
from
him
praying
begging
weeping
at
last
threatening

he
began
to
raise
his
voicei
prayed
him
not
to

he
perceived
a
hold
on
mehe
threatened
he
would
shout
and
bring
the
martians
upon
us

for
a
time
that
scared
me
but
any
concession
would
have
shortened
our
chance
of
escape
beyond
estimating

I
defied
him
although
I
felt
no
assurance
that
he
might
not
do
this
thing

but
that
day
at
any
rate
he
did
not

he
talked
with
his
voice
rising
slowly
through
the
greater
part
of
the
eighth
and
ninth
daysthreats
entreaties
mingled
with
a
torrent
of
halfsane
and
always
frothy
repentance
for
his
vacant
sham
of
god's
service
such
as
made
me
pity
him

then
he
slept
awhile
and
began
again
with
renewed
strength
so
loudly
that
I
must
needs
make
him
desist

be
still
I
implored

he
rose
to
his
knees
for
he
had
been
sitting
in
the
darkness
near
the
copper

I
have
been
still
too
long
he
said
in
a
tone
that
must
have
reached
the
pit
and
now
I
must
bear
my
witness

woe
unto
this
unfaithful
city

woe

woe

woe

woe

woe
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
other
voices
of
the
trumpet

shut
up
I
said
rising
to
my
feet
and
in
a
terror
lest
the
martians
should
hear
us

for
god's
sake

nay
shouted
the
curate
at
the
top
of
his
voice
standing
likewise
and
extending
his
arms

speak

the
word
of
the
lord
is
upon
me

in
three
strides
he
was
at
the
door
leading
into
the
kitchen

I
must
bear
my
witness

I
go

it
has
already
been
too
long
delayed

I
put
out
my
hand
and
felt
the
meat
chopper
hanging
to
the
wall
in
a
flash
I
was
after
him

I
was
fierce
with
fear

before
he
was
halfway
across
the
kitchen
I
had
overtaken
him

with
one
last
touch
of
humanity
I
turned
the
blade
back
and
struck
him
with
the
butt

he
went
headlong
forward
and
lay
stretched
on
the
ground

I
stumbled
over
him
and
stood
panting

he
lay
still

suddenly
I
heard
a
noise
without
the
run
and
smash
of
slipping
plaster
and
the
triangular
aperture
in
the
wall
was
darkened

I
looked
up
and
saw
the
lower
surface
of
a
handlingmachine
coming
slowly
across
the
hole

one
of
its
gripping
limbs
curled
amid
the
debris
another
limb
appeared
feeling
its
way
over
the
fallen
beams
I
stood
petrified
staring

then
I
saw
through
a
sort
of
glass
plate
near
the
edge
of
the
body
the
face
as
we
may
call
it
and
the
large
dark
eyes
of
a
martian
peering
and
then
a
long
metallic
snake
of
tentacle
came
feeling
slowly
through
the
hole

I
turned
by
an
effort
stumbled
over
the
curate
and
stopped
at
the
scullery
door

the
tentacle
was
now
some
way
two
yards
or
more
in
the
room
and
twisting
and
turning
with
queer
sudden
movements
this
way
and
that

for
a
while
I
stood
fascinated
by
that
slow
fitful
advance

then
with
a
faint
hoarse
cry
I
forced
myself
across
the
scullery

I
trembled
violently
I
could
scarcely
stand
upright

I
opened
the
door
of
the
coal
cellar
and
stood
there
in
the
darkness
staring
at
the
faintly
lit
doorway
into
the
kitchen
and
listening
had
the
martian
seen
me

what
was
it
doing
now

something
was
moving
to
and
fro
there
very
quietly
every
now
and
then
it
tapped
against
the
wall
or
started
on
its
movements
with
a
faint
metallic
ringing
like
the
movements
of
keys
on
a
splitring
then
a
heavy
bodyi
knew
too
well
whatwas
dragged
across
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
towards
the
opening

irresistibly
attracted
I
crept
to
the
door
and
peeped
into
the
kitchen

in
the
triangle
of
bright
outer
sunlight
I
saw
the
martian
in
its
briareus
of
a
handlingmachine
scrutinizing
the
curate's
head

I
thought
at
once
that
it
would
infer
my
presence
from
the
mark
of
the
blow
I
had
given
him

I
crept
back
to
the
coal
cellar
shut
the
door
and
began
to
cover
myself
up
as
much
as
I
could
and
as
noiselessly
as
possible
in
the
darkness
among
the
firewood
and
coal
therein

every
now
and
then
I
paused
rigid
to
hear
if
the
martian
had
thrust
its
tentacles
through
the
opening
again

then
the
faint
metallic
jingle
returned

I
traced
it
slowly
feeling
over
the
kitchen

presently
I
heard
it
nearerin
the
scullery
as
I
judged

I
thought
that
its
length
might
be
insufficient
to
reach
me

I
prayed
copiously

it
passed
scraping
faintly
across
the
cellar
door

an
age
of
almost
intolerable
suspense
intervened
then
I
heard
it
fumbling
at
the
latch
it
had
found
the
door

the
martians
understood
doors

it
worried
at
the
catch
for
a
minute
perhaps
and
then
the
door
opened

in
the
darkness
I
could
just
see
the
thinglike
an
elephant's
trunk
more
than
anything
elsewaving
towards
me
and
touching
and
examining
the
wall
coals
wood
and
ceiling

it
was
like
a
black
worm
swaying
its
blind
head
to
and
fro

once
even
it
touched
the
heel
of
my
boot

I
was
on
the
verge
of
screaming
I
bit
my
hand

for
a
time
the
tentacle
was
silent

I
could
have
fancied
it
had
been
withdrawn

presently
with
an
abrupt
click
it
gripped
somethingi
thought
it
had
meand
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
cellar
again

for
a
minute
I
was
not
sure

apparently
it
had
taken
a
lump
of
coal
to
examine

I
seized
the
opportunity
of
slightly
shifting
my
position
which
had
become
cramped
and
then
listened

I
whispered
passionate
prayers
for
safety

then
I
heard
the
slow
deliberate
sound
creeping
towards
me
again
slowly
slowly
it
drew
near
scratching
against
the
walls
and
tapping
the
furniture

while
I
was
still
doubtful
it
rapped
smartly
against
the
cellar
door
and
closed
it

I
heard
it
go
into
the
pantry
and
the
biscuittins
rattled
and
a
bottle
smashed
and
then
came
a
heavy
bump
against
the
cellar
door

then
silence
that
passed
into
an
infinity
of
suspense

had
it
gone

at
last
I
decided
that
it
had

it
came
into
the
scullery
no
more
but
I
lay
all
the
tenth
day
in
the
close
darkness
buried
among
coals
and
firewood
not
daring
even
to
crawl
out
for
the
drink
for
which
I
craved

it
was
the
eleventh
day
before
I
ventured
so
far
from
my
security



chapter
five

the
stillness


my
first
act
before
I
went
into
the
pantry
was
to
fasten
the
door
between
the
kitchen
and
the
scullery

but
the
pantry
was
empty
every
scrap
of
food
had
gone

apparently
the
martian
had
taken
it
all
on
the
previous
day

at
that
discovery
I
despaired
for
the
first
time

I
took
no
food
or
no
drink
either
on
the
eleventh
or
the
twelfth
day

at
first
my
mouth
and
throat
were
parched
and
my
strength
ebbed
sensibly

I
sat
about
in
the
darkness
of
the
scullery
in
a
state
of
despondent
wretchedness

my
mind
ran
on
eating

I
thought
I
had
become
deaf
for
the
noises
of
movement
I
had
been
accustomed
to
hear
from
the
pit
had
ceased
absolutely

I
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
crawl
noiselessly
to
the
peephole
or
I
would
have
gone
there

on
the
twelfth
day
my
throat
was
so
painful
that
taking
the
chance
of
alarming
the
martians
I
attacked
the
creaking
rainwater
pump
that
stood
by
the
sink
and
got
a
couple
of
glassfuls
of
blackened
and
tainted
rain
water

I
was
greatly
refreshed
by
this
and
emboldened
by
the
fact
that
no
enquiring
tentacle
followed
the
noise
of
my
pumping

during
these
days
in
a
rambling
inconclusive
way
I
thought
much
of
the
curate
and
of
the
manner
of
his
death

on
the
thirteenth
day
I
drank
some
more
water
and
dozed
and
thought
disjointedly
of
eating
and
of
vague
impossible
plans
of
escape

whenever
I
dozed
I
dreamt
of
horrible
phantasms
of
the
death
of
the
curate
or
of
sumptuous
dinners
but
asleep
or
awake
I
felt
a
keen
pain
that
urged
me
to
drink
again
and
again

the
light
that
came
into
the
scullery
was
no
longer
grey
but
red

to
my
disordered
imagination
it
seemed
the
colour
of
blood

on
the
fourteenth
day
I
went
into
the
kitchen
and
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
fronds
of
the
red
weed
had
grown
right
across
the
hole
in
the
wall
turning
the
halflight
of
the
place
into
a
crimsoncoloured
obscurity

it
was
early
on
the
fifteenth
day
that
I
heard
a
curious
familiar
sequence
of
sounds
in
the
kitchen
and
listening
identified
it
as
the
snuffing
and
scratching
of
a
dog

going
into
the
kitchen
I
saw
a
dog's
nose
peering
in
through
a
break
among
the
ruddy
fronds

this
greatly
surprised
me

at
the
scent
of
me
he
barked
shortly

I
thought
if
I
could
induce
him
to
come
into
the
place
quietly
I
should
be
able
perhaps
to
kill
and
eat
him
and
in
any
case
it
would
be
advisable
to
kill
him
lest
his
actions
attracted
the
attention
of
the
martians

I
crept
forward
saying
good
dog
very
softly
but
he
suddenly
withdrew
his
head
and
disappeared

I
listenedi
was
not
deafbut
certainly
the
pit
was
still

I
heard
a
sound
like
the
flutter
of
a
bird's
wings
and
a
hoarse
croaking
but
that
was
all

for
a
long
while
I
lay
close
to
the
peephole
but
not
daring
to
move
aside
the
red
plants
that
obscured
it

once
or
twice
I
heard
a
faint
pitterpatter
like
the
feet
of
the
dog
going
hither
and
thither
on
the
sand
far
below
me
and
there
were
more
birdlike
sounds
but
that
was
all

at
length
encouraged
by
the
silence
I
looked
out

except
in
the
corner
where
a
multitude
of
crows
hopped
and
fought
over
the
skeletons
of
the
dead
the
martians
had
consumed
there
was
not
a
living
thing
in
the
pit

I
stared
about
me
scarcely
believing
my
eyes

all
the
machinery
had
gone

save
for
the
big
mound
of
greyishblue
powder
in
one
corner
certain
bars
of
aluminium
in
another
the
black
birds
and
the
skeletons
of
the
killed
the
place
was
merely
an
empty
circular
pit
in
the
sand

slowly
I
thrust
myself
out
through
the
red
weed
and
stood
upon
the
mound
of
rubble

I
could
see
in
any
direction
save
behind
me
to
the
north
and
neither
martians
nor
sign
of
martians
were
to
be
seen

the
pit
dropped
sheerly
from
my
feet
but
a
little
way
along
the
rubbish
afforded
a
practicable
slope
to
the
summit
of
the
ruins

my
chance
of
escape
had
come

I
began
to
tremble

I
hesitated
for
some
time
and
then
in
a
gust
of
desperate
resolution
and
with
a
heart
that
throbbed
violently
I
scrambled
to
the
top
of
the
mound
in
which
I
had
been
buried
so
long

I
looked
about
again

to
the
northward
too
no
martian
was
visible

when
I
had
last
seen
this
part
of
sheen
in
the
daylight
it
had
been
a
straggling
street
of
comfortable
white
and
red
houses
interspersed
with
abundant
shady
trees

now
I
stood
on
a
mound
of
smashed
brickwork
clay
and
gravel
over
which
spread
a
multitude
of
red
cactusshaped
plants
kneehigh
without
a
solitary
terrestrial
growth
to
dispute
their
footing

the
trees
near
me
were
dead
and
brown
but
further
a
network
of
red
thread
scaled
the
still
living
stems

the
neighbouring
houses
had
all
been
wrecked
but
none
had
been
burned
their
walls
stood
sometimes
to
the
second
story
with
smashed
windows
and
shattered
doors

the
red
weed
grew
tumultuously
in
their
roofless
rooms

below
me
was
the
great
pit
with
the
crows
struggling
for
its
refuse

a
number
of
other
birds
hopped
about
among
the
ruins
far
away
I
saw
a
gaunt
cat
slink
crouchingly
along
a
wall
but
traces
of
men
there
were
none

the
day
seemed
by
contrast
with
my
recent
confinement
dazzlingly
bright
the
sky
a
glowing
blue

a
gentle
breeze
kept
the
red
weed
that
covered
every
scrap
of
unoccupied
ground
gently
swaying

and
oh
the
sweetness
of
the
air



chapter
six

the
work
of
fifteen
days


for
some
time
I
stood
tottering
on
the
mound
regardless
of
my
safety

within
that
noisome
den
from
which
I
had
emerged
I
had
thought
with
a
narrow
intensity
only
of
our
immediate
security

I
had
not
realised
what
had
been
happening
to
the
world
had
not
anticipated
this
startling
vision
of
unfamiliar
things

I
had
expected
to
see
sheen
in
ruinsi
found
about
me
the
landscape
weird
and
lurid
of
another
planet

for
that
moment
I
touched
an
emotion
beyond
the
common
range
of
men
yet
one
that
the
poor
brutes
we
dominate
know
only
too
well

I
felt
as
a
rabbit
might
feel
returning
to
his
burrow
and
suddenly
confronted
by
the
work
of
a
dozen
busy
navvies
digging
the
foundations
of
a
house

I
felt
the
first
inkling
of
a
thing
that
presently
grew
quite
clear
in
my
mind
that
oppressed
me
for
many
days
a
sense
of
dethronement
a
persuasion
that
I
was
no
longer
a
master
but
an
animal
among
the
animals
under
the
martian
heel

with
us
it
would
be
as
with
them
to
lurk
and
watch
to
run
and
hide
the
fear
and
empire
of
man
had
passed
away

but
so
soon
as
this
strangeness
had
been
realised
it
passed
and
my
dominant
motive
became
the
hunger
of
my
long
and
dismal
fast

in
the
direction
away
from
the
pit
I
saw
beyond
a
redcovered
wall
a
patch
of
garden
ground
unburied

this
gave
me
a
hint
and
I
went
kneedeep
and
sometimes
neckdeep
in
the
red
weed

the
density
of
the
weed
gave
me
a
reassuring
sense
of
hiding

the
wall
was
some
six
feet
high
and
when
I
attempted
to
clamber
it
I
found
I
could
not
lift
my
feet
to
the
crest

so
I
went
along
by
the
side
of
it
and
came
to
a
corner
and
a
rockwork
that
enabled
me
to
get
to
the
top
and
tumble
into
the
garden
I
coveted

here
I
found
some
young
onions
a
couple
of
gladiolus
bulbs
and
a
quantity
of
immature
carrots
all
of
which
I
secured
and
scrambling
over
a
ruined
wall
went
on
my
way
through
scarlet
and
crimson
trees
towards
kewit
was
like
walking
through
an
avenue
of
gigantic
blood
dropspossessed
with
two
ideas
to
get
more
food
and
to
limp
as
soon
and
as
far
as
my
strength
permitted
out
of
this
accursed
unearthly
region
of
the
pit

some
way
farther
in
a
grassy
place
was
a
group
of
mushrooms
which
also
I
devoured
and
then
I
came
upon
a
brown
sheet
of
flowing
shallow
water
where
meadows
used
to
be

these
fragments
of
nourishment
served
only
to
whet
my
hunger

at
first
I
was
surprised
at
this
flood
in
a
hot
dry
summer
but
afterwards
I
discovered
that
it
was
caused
by
the
tropical
exuberance
of
the
red
weed

directly
this
extraordinary
growth
encountered
water
it
straightway
became
gigantic
and
of
unparalleled
fecundity

its
seeds
were
simply
poured
down
into
the
water
of
the
wey
and
thames
and
its
swiftly
growing
and
titanic
water
fronds
speedily
choked
both
those
rivers

at
putney
as
I
afterwards
saw
the
bridge
was
almost
lost
in
a
tangle
of
this
weed
and
at
richmond
too
the
thames
water
poured
in
a
broad
and
shallow
stream
across
the
meadows
of
hampton
and
twickenham

as
the
water
spread
the
weed
followed
them
until
the
ruined
villas
of
the
thames
valley
were
for
a
time
lost
in
this
red
swamp
whose
margin
I
explored
and
much
of
the
desolation
the
martians
had
caused
was
concealed

in
the
end
the
red
weed
succumbed
almost
as
quickly
as
it
had
spread

a
cankering
disease
due
it
is
believed
to
the
action
of
certain
bacteria
presently
seized
upon
it

now
by
the
action
of
natural
selection
all
terrestrial
plants
have
acquired
a
resisting
power
against
bacterial
diseasesthey
never
succumb
without
a
severe
struggle
but
the
red
weed
rotted
like
a
thing
already
dead

the
fronds
became
bleached
and
then
shrivelled
and
brittle

they
broke
off
at
the
least
touch
and
the
waters
that
had
stimulated
their
early
growth
carried
their
last
vestiges
out
to
sea

my
first
act
on
coming
to
this
water
was
of
course
to
slake
my
thirst

I
drank
a
great
deal
of
it
and
moved
by
an
impulse
gnawed
some
fronds
of
red
weed
but
they
were
watery
and
had
a
sickly
metallic
taste

I
found
the
water
was
sufficiently
shallow
for
me
to
wade
securely
although
the
red
weed
impeded
my
feet
a
little
but
the
flood
evidently
got
deeper
towards
the
river
and
I
turned
back
to
mortlake

I
managed
to
make
out
the
road
by
means
of
occasional
ruins
of
its
villas
and
fences
and
lamps
and
so
presently
I
got
out
of
this
spate
and
made
my
way
to
the
hill
going
up
towards
roehampton
and
came
out
on
putney
common

here
the
scenery
changed
from
the
strange
and
unfamiliar
to
the
wreckage
of
the
familiar
patches
of
ground
exhibited
the
devastation
of
a
cyclone
and
in
a
few
score
yards
I
would
come
upon
perfectly
undisturbed
spaces
houses
with
their
blinds
trimly
drawn
and
doors
closed
as
if
they
had
been
left
for
a
day
by
the
owners
or
as
if
their
inhabitants
slept
within

the
red
weed
was
less
abundant
the
tall
trees
along
the
lane
were
free
from
the
red
creeper

I
hunted
for
food
among
the
trees
finding
nothing
and
I
also
raided
a
couple
of
silent
houses
but
they
had
already
been
broken
into
and
ransacked
I
rested
for
the
remainder
of
the
daylight
in
a
shrubbery
being
in
my
enfeebled
condition
too
fatigued
to
push
on

all
this
time
I
saw
no
human
beings
and
no
signs
of
the
martians
I
encountered
a
couple
of
hungrylooking
dogs
but
both
hurried
circuitously
away
from
the
advances
I
made
them

near
roehampton
I
had
seen
two
human
skeletonsnot
bodies
but
skeletons
picked
cleanand
in
the
wood
by
me
I
found
the
crushed
and
scattered
bones
of
several
cats
and
rabbits
and
the
skull
of
a
sheep

but
though
I
gnawed
parts
of
these
in
my
mouth
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
from
them

after
sunset
I
struggled
on
along
the
road
towards
putney
where
I
think
the
heatray
must
have
been
used
for
some
reason

and
in
the
garden
beyond
roehampton
I
got
a
quantity
of
immature
potatoes
sufficient
to
stay
my
hunger

from
this
garden
one
looked
down
upon
putney
and
the
river

the
aspect
of
the
place
in
the
dusk
was
singularly
desolate
blackened
trees
blackened
desolate
ruins
and
down
the
hill
the
sheets
of
the
flooded
river
redtinged
with
the
weed

and
over
allsilence

it
filled
me
with
indescribable
terror
to
think
how
swiftly
that
desolating
change
had
come

for
a
time
I
believed
that
mankind
had
been
swept
out
of
existence
and
that
I
stood
there
alone
the
last
man
left
alive

hard
by
the
top
of
putney
hill
I
came
upon
another
skeleton
with
the
arms
dislocated
and
removed
several
yards
from
the
rest
of
the
body

as
I
proceeded
I
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
extermination
of
mankind
was
save
for
such
stragglers
as
myself
already
accomplished
in
this
part
of
the
world

the
martians
I
thought
had
gone
on
and
left
the
country
desolated
seeking
food
elsewhere

perhaps
even
now
they
were
destroying
berlin
or
paris
or
it
might
be
they
had
gone
northward



chapter
seven

the
man
on
putney
hill


I
spent
that
night
in
the
inn
that
stands
at
the
top
of
putney
hill
sleeping
in
a
made
bed
for
the
first
time
since
my
flight
to
leatherhead

I
will
not
tell
the
needless
trouble
I
had
breaking
into
that
houseafterwards
I
found
the
front
door
was
on
the
latchnor
how
I
ransacked
every
room
for
food
until
just
on
the
verge
of
despair
in
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
servant's
bedroom
I
found
a
ratgnawed
crust
and
two
tins
of
pineapple

the
place
had
been
already
searched
and
emptied

in
the
bar
I
afterwards
found
some
biscuits
and
sandwiches
that
had
been
overlooked

the
latter
I
could
not
eat
they
were
too
rotten
but
the
former
not
only
stayed
my
hunger
but
filled
my
pockets

I
lit
no
lamps
fearing
some
martian
might
come
beating
that
part
of
london
for
food
in
the
night

before
I
went
to
bed
I
had
an
interval
of
restlessness
and
prowled
from
window
to
window
peering
out
for
some
sign
of
these
monsters

I
slept
little

as
I
lay
in
bed
I
found
myself
thinking
consecutivelya
thing
I
do
not
remember
to
have
done
since
my
last
argument
with
the
curate

during
all
the
intervening
time
my
mental
condition
had
been
a
hurrying
succession
of
vague
emotional
states
or
a
sort
of
stupid
receptivity

but
in
the
night
my
brain
reinforced
I
suppose
by
the
food
I
had
eaten
grew
clear
again
and
I
thought

three
things
struggled
for
possession
of
my
mind
the
killing
of
the
curate
the
whereabouts
of
the
martians
and
the
possible
fate
of
my
wife

the
former
gave
me
no
sensation
of
horror
or
remorse
to
recall
I
saw
it
simply
as
a
thing
done
a
memory
infinitely
disagreeable
but
quite
without
the
quality
of
remorse

I
saw
myself
then
as
I
see
myself
now
driven
step
by
step
towards
that
hasty
blow
the
creature
of
a
sequence
of
accidents
leading
inevitably
to
that

I
felt
no
condemnation
yet
the
memory
static
unprogressive
haunted
me

in
the
silence
of
the
night
with
that
sense
of
the
nearness
of
god
that
sometimes
comes
into
the
stillness
and
the
darkness
I
stood
my
trial
my
only
trial
for
that
moment
of
wrath
and
fear

I
retraced
every
step
of
our
conversation
from
the
moment
when
I
had
found
him
crouching
beside
me
heedless
of
my
thirst
and
pointing
to
the
fire
and
smoke
that
streamed
up
from
the
ruins
of
weybridge

we
had
been
incapable
of
cooperationgrim
chance
had
taken
no
heed
of
that

had
I
foreseen
I
should
have
left
him
at
halliford

but
I
did
not
foresee
and
crime
is
to
foresee
and
do

and
I
set
this
down
as
I
have
set
all
this
story
down
as
it
was

there
were
no
witnessesall
these
things
I
might
have
concealed

but
I
set
it
down
and
the
reader
must
form
his
judgment
as
he
will

and
when
by
an
effort
I
had
set
aside
that
picture
of
a
prostrate
body
I
faced
the
problem
of
the
martians
and
the
fate
of
my
wife

for
the
former
I
had
no
data
I
could
imagine
a
hundred
things
and
so
unhappily
I
could
for
the
latter

and
suddenly
that
night
became
terrible

I
found
myself
sitting
up
in
bed
staring
at
the
dark

I
found
myself
praying
that
the
heatray
might
have
suddenly
and
painlessly
struck
her
out
of
being

since
the
night
of
my
return
from
leatherhead
I
had
not
prayed

I
had
uttered
prayers
fetish
prayers
had
prayed
as
heathens
mutter
charms
when
I
was
in
extremity
but
now
I
prayed
indeed
pleading
steadfastly
and
sanely
face
to
face
with
the
darkness
of
god

strange
night

strangest
in
this
that
so
soon
as
dawn
had
come
I
who
had
talked
with
god
crept
out
of
the
house
like
a
rat
leaving
its
hiding
placea
creature
scarcely
larger
an
inferior
animal
a
thing
that
for
any
passing
whim
of
our
masters
might
be
hunted
and
killed

perhaps
they
also
prayed
confidently
to
god

surely
if
we
have
learned
nothing
else
this
war
has
taught
us
pitypity
for
those
witless
souls
that
suffer
our
dominion

the
morning
was
bright
and
fine
and
the
eastern
sky
glowed
pink
and
was
fretted
with
little
golden
clouds

in
the
road
that
runs
from
the
top
of
putney
hill
to
wimbledon
was
a
number
of
poor
vestiges
of
the
panic
torrent
that
must
have
poured
londonward
on
the
sunday
night
after
the
fighting
began

there
was
a
little
twowheeled
cart
inscribed
with
the
name
of
thomas
lobb
greengrocer
new
malden
with
a
smashed
wheel
and
an
abandoned
tin
trunk
there
was
a
straw
hat
trampled
into
the
now
hardened
mud
and
at
the
top
of
west
hill
a
lot
of
bloodstained
glass
about
the
overturned
water
trough

my
movements
were
languid
my
plans
of
the
vaguest

I
had
an
idea
of
going
to
leatherhead
though
I
knew
that
there
I
had
the
poorest
chance
of
finding
my
wife

certainly
unless
death
had
overtaken
them
suddenly
my
cousins
and
she
would
have
fled
thence
but
it
seemed
to
me
I
might
find
or
learn
there
whither
the
surrey
people
had
fled

I
knew
I
wanted
to
find
my
wife
that
my
heart
ached
for
her
and
the
world
of
men
but
I
had
no
clear
idea
how
the
finding
might
be
done

I
was
also
sharply
aware
now
of
my
intense
loneliness

from
the
corner
I
went
under
cover
of
a
thicket
of
trees
and
bushes
to
the
edge
of
wimbledon
common
stretching
wide
and
far

that
dark
expanse
was
lit
in
patches
by
yellow
gorse
and
broom
there
was
no
red
weed
to
be
seen
and
as
I
prowled
hesitating
on
the
verge
of
the
open
the
sun
rose
flooding
it
all
with
light
and
vitality

I
came
upon
a
busy
swarm
of
little
frogs
in
a
swampy
place
among
the
trees

I
stopped
to
look
at
them
drawing
a
lesson
from
their
stout
resolve
to
live

and
presently
turning
suddenly
with
an
odd
feeling
of
being
watched
I
beheld
something
crouching
amid
a
clump
of
bushes

I
stood
regarding
this

I
made
a
step
towards
it
and
it
rose
up
and
became
a
man
armed
with
a
cutlass

I
approached
him
slowly

he
stood
silent
and
motionless
regarding
me

as
I
drew
nearer
I
perceived
he
was
dressed
in
clothes
as
dusty
and
filthy
as
my
own
he
looked
indeed
as
though
he
had
been
dragged
through
a
culvert

nearer
I
distinguished
the
green
slime
of
ditches
mixing
with
the
pale
drab
of
dried
clay
and
shiny
coaly
patches

his
black
hair
fell
over
his
eyes
and
his
face
was
dark
and
dirty
and
sunken
so
that
at
first
I
did
not
recognise
him

there
was
a
red
cut
across
the
lower
part
of
his
face

stop
he
cried
when
I
was
within
ten
yards
of
him
and
I
stopped

his
voice
was
hoarse

where
do
you
come
from
he
said

I
thought
surveying
him

I
come
from
mortlake
I
said

I
was
buried
near
the
pit
the
martians
made
about
their
cylinder

I
have
worked
my
way
out
and
escaped

there
is
no
food
about
here
he
said

this
is
my
country

all
this
hill
down
to
the
river
and
back
to
clapham
and
up
to
the
edge
of
the
common

there
is
only
food
for
one

which
way
are
you
going

I
answered
slowly

I
don't
know
I
said

I
have
been
buried
in
the
ruins
of
a
house
thirteen
or
fourteen
days

I
don't
know
what
has
happened

he
looked
at
me
doubtfully
then
started
and
looked
with
a
changed
expression

i've
no
wish
to
stop
about
here
said
I

I
think
I
shall
go
to
leatherhead
for
my
wife
was
there

he
shot
out
a
pointing
finger

it
is
you
said
he
the
man
from
woking

and
you
weren't
killed
at
weybridge

I
recognised
him
at
the
same
moment

you
are
the
artilleryman
who
came
into
my
garden

good
luck
he
said

we
are
lucky
ones

fancy
you

he
put
out
a
hand
and
I
took
it

I
crawled
up
a
drain
he
said
but
they
didn't
kill
everyone

and
after
they
went
away
I
got
off
towards
walton
across
the
fields

but
it's
not
sixteen
days
altogetherand
your
hair
is
grey

he
looked
over
his
shoulder
suddenly

only
a
rook
he
said

one
gets
to
know
that
birds
have
shadows
these
days

this
is
a
bit
open

let
us
crawl
under
those
bushes
and
talk

have
you
seen
any
martians
I
said

since
I
crawled
out

they've
gone
away
across
london
he
said

I
guess
they've
got
a
bigger
camp
there

of
a
night
all
over
there
hampstead
way
the
sky
is
alive
with
their
lights

it's
like
a
great
city
and
in
the
glare
you
can
just
see
them
moving

by
daylight
you
can't

but
neareri
haven't
seen
them
he
counted
on
his
fingers
five
days

then
I
saw
a
couple
across
hammersmith
way
carrying
something
big

and
the
night
before
lasthe
stopped
and
spoke
impressivelyit
was
just
a
matter
of
lights
but
it
was
something
up
in
the
air

I
believe
they've
built
a
flyingmachine
and
are
learning
to
fly

I
stopped
on
hands
and
knees
for
we
had
come
to
the
bushes

fly

yes
he
said
fly

I
went
on
into
a
little
bower
and
sat
down

it
is
all
over
with
humanity
I
said

if
they
can
do
that
they
will
simply
go
round
the
world

he
nodded

they
will

but
it
will
relieve
things
over
here
a
bit

and
besides

he
looked
at
me

aren't
you
satisfied
it
is
up
with
humanity

I
am

we're
down
we're
beat

I
stared

strange
as
it
may
seem
I
had
not
arrived
at
this
facta
fact
perfectly
obvious
so
soon
as
he
spoke

I
had
still
held
a
vague
hope
rather
I
had
kept
a
lifelong
habit
of
mind

he
repeated
his
words
we're
beat

they
carried
absolute
conviction

it's
all
over
he
said

they've
lost
onejust
one

and
they've
made
their
footing
good
and
crippled
the
greatest
power
in
the
world
they've
walked
over
us

the
death
of
that
one
at
weybridge
was
an
accident

and
these
are
only
pioneers

they
kept
on
coming

these
green
starsi've
seen
none
these
five
or
six
days
but
i've
no
doubt
they're
falling
somewhere
every
night

nothing's
to
be
done

we're
under
we're
beat

I
made
him
no
answer

I
sat
staring
before
me
trying
in
vain
to
devise
some
countervailing
thought

this
isn't
a
war
said
the
artilleryman

it
never
was
a
war
any
more
than
there's
war
between
man
and
ants

suddenly
I
recalled
the
night
in
the
observatory

after
the
tenth
shot
they
fired
no
moreat
least
until
the
first
cylinder
came

how
do
you
know
said
the
artilleryman

I
explained

he
thought
something
wrong
with
the
gun
he
said

but
what
if
there
is
they'll
get
it
right
again

and
even
if
there's
a
delay
how
can
it
alter
the
end

it's
just
men
and
ants

there's
the
ants
builds
their
cities
live
their
lives
have
wars
revolutions
until
the
men
want
them
out
of
the
way
and
then
they
go
out
of
the
way

that's
what
we
are
nowjust
ants

only

yes
I
said

we're
eatable
ants

we
sat
looking
at
each
other

and
what
will
they
do
with
us
I
said

that's
what
i've
been
thinking
he
said
that's
what
i've
been
thinking

after
weybridge
I
went
souththinking

I
saw
what
was
up
most
of
the
people
were
hard
at
it
squealing
and
exciting
themselves
but
i'm
not
so
fond
of
squealing

i've
been
in
sight
of
death
once
or
twice
i'm
not
an
ornamental
soldier
and
at
the
best
and
worst
deathit's
just
death

and
it's
the
man
that
keeps
on
thinking
comes
through

I
saw
everyone
tracking
away
south

says
I
'food
won't
last
this
way'
and
I
turned
right
back

I
went
for
the
martians
like
a
sparrow
goes
for
man

all
roundhe
waved
a
hand
to
the
horizonthey're
starving
in
heaps
bolting
treading
on
each
other




he
saw
my
face
and
halted
awkwardly

no
doubt
lots
who
had
money
have
gone
away
to
france
he
said

he
seemed
to
hesitate
whether
to
apologise
met
my
eyes
and
went
on
there's
food
all
about
here

canned
things
in
shops
wines
spirits
mineral
waters
and
the
water
mains
and
drains
are
empty

well
I
was
telling
you
what
I
was
thinking

'here's
intelligent
things'
I
said
'and
it
seems
they
want
us
for
food

first
they'll
smash
us
upships
machines
guns
cities
all
the
order
and
organisation

all
that
will
go

if
we
were
the
size
of
ants
we
might
pull
through

but
we're
not

it's
all
too
bulky
to
stop

that's
the
first
certainty'
eh

I
assented

it
is
i've
thought
it
out

very
well
thennext
at
present
we're
caught
as
we're
wanted

a
martian
has
only
to
go
a
few
miles
to
get
a
crowd
on
the
run

and
I
saw
one
one
day
out
by
wandsworth
picking
houses
to
pieces
and
routing
among
the
wreckage

but
they
won't
keep
on
doing
that

so
soon
as
they've
settled
all
our
guns
and
ships
and
smashed
our
railways
and
done
all
the
things
they
are
doing
over
there
they
will
begin
catching
us
systematic
picking
the
best
and
storing
us
in
cages
and
things

that's
what
they
will
start
doing
in
a
bit

lord

they
haven't
begun
on
us
yet

don't
you
see
that

not
begun
I
exclaimed

not
begun

all
that's
happened
so
far
is
through
our
not
having
the
sense
to
keep
quietworrying
them
with
guns
and
such
foolery

and
losing
our
heads
and
rushing
off
in
crowds
to
where
there
wasn't
any
more
safety
than
where
we
were

they
don't
want
to
bother
us
yet
they're
making
their
thingsmaking
all
the
things
they
couldn't
bring
with
them
getting
things
ready
for
the
rest
of
their
people

very
likely
that's
why
the
cylinders
have
stopped
for
a
bit
for
fear
of
hitting
those
who
are
here

and
instead
of
our
rushing
about
blind
on
the
howl
or
getting
dynamite
on
the
chance
of
busting
them
up
we've
got
to
fix
ourselves
up
according
to
the
new
state
of
affairs
that's
how
I
figure
it
out

it
isn't
quite
according
to
what
a
man
wants
for
his
species
but
it's
about
what
the
facts
point
to

and
that's
the
principle
I
acted
upon

cities
nations
civilisation
progressit's
all
over

that
game's
up

we're
beat

but
if
that
is
so
what
is
there
to
live
for

the
artilleryman
looked
at
me
for
a
moment

there
won't
be
any
more
blessed
concerts
for
a
million
years
or
so
there
won't
be
any
royal
academy
of
arts
and
no
nice
little
feeds
at
restaurants

if
it's
amusement
you're
after
I
reckon
the
game
is
up

if
you've
got
any
drawingroom
manners
or
a
dislike
to
eating
peas
with
a
knife
or
dropping
aitches
you'd
better
chuck
'em
away
they
ain't
no
further
use

you
mean

I
mean
that
men
like
me
are
going
on
livingfor
the
sake
of
the
breed

I
tell
you
i'm
grim
set
on
living

and
if
i'm
not
mistaken
you'll
show
what
insides
you've
got
too
before
long

we
aren't
going
to
be
exterminated

and
I
don't
mean
to
be
caught
either
and
tamed
and
fattened
and
bred
like
a
thundering
ox

ugh
fancy
those
brown
creepers

you
don't
mean
to
say

I
do

i'm
going
on
under
their
feet

i've
got
it
planned
i've
thought
it
out

we
men
are
beat

we
don't
know
enough

we've
got
to
learn
before
we've
got
a
chance

and
we've
got
to
live
and
keep
independent
while
we
learn

see
that's
what
has
to
be
done

I
stared
astonished
and
stirred
profoundly
by
the
man's
resolution

great
god
cried
I

but
you
are
a
man
indeed

and
suddenly
I
gripped
his
hand

eh
he
said
with
his
eyes
shining

i've
thought
it
out
eh

go
on
I
said

well
those
who
mean
to
escape
their
catching
must
get
ready

i'm
getting
ready

mind
you
it
isn't
all
of
us
that
are
made
for
wild
beasts
and
that's
what
it's
got
to
be

that's
why
I
watched
you

I
had
my
doubts

you're
slender

I
didn't
know
that
it
was
you
you
see
or
just
how
you'd
been
buried

all
thesethe
sort
of
people
that
lived
in
these
houses
and
all
those
damn
little
clerks
that
used
to
live
down
that
waythey'd
be
no
good

they
haven't
any
spirit
in
themno
proud
dreams
and
no
proud
lusts
and
a
man
who
hasn't
one
or
the
otherlord

what
is
he
but
funk
and
precautions

they
just
used
to
skedaddle
off
to
worki've
seen
hundreds
of
'em
bit
of
breakfast
in
hand
running
wild
and
shining
to
catch
their
little
seasonticket
train
for
fear
they'd
get
dismissed
if
they
didn't
working
at
businesses
they
were
afraid
to
take
the
trouble
to
understand
skedaddling
back
for
fear
they
wouldn't
be
in
time
for
dinner
keeping
indoors
after
dinner
for
fear
of
the
back
streets
and
sleeping
with
the
wives
they
married
not
because
they
wanted
them
but
because
they
had
a
bit
of
money
that
would
make
for
safety
in
their
one
little
miserable
skedaddle
through
the
world

lives
insured
and
a
bit
invested
for
fear
of
accidents

and
on
sundaysfear
of
the
hereafter

as
if
hell
was
built
for
rabbits

well
the
martians
will
just
be
a
godsend
to
these

nice
roomy
cages
fattening
food
careful
breeding
no
worry

after
a
week
or
so
chasing
about
the
fields
and
lands
on
empty
stomachs
they'll
come
and
be
caught
cheerful

they'll
be
quite
glad
after
a
bit

they'll
wonder
what
people
did
before
there
were
martians
to
take
care
of
them

and
the
bar
loafers
and
mashers
and
singersi
can
imagine
them

I
can
imagine
them
he
said
with
a
sort
of
sombre
gratification

there'll
be
any
amount
of
sentiment
and
religion
loose
among
them

there's
hundreds
of
things
I
saw
with
my
eyes
that
i've
only
begun
to
see
clearly
these
last
few
days

there's
lots
will
take
things
as
they
arefat
and
stupid
and
lots
will
be
worried
by
a
sort
of
feeling
that
it's
all
wrong
and
that
they
ought
to
be
doing
something

now
whenever
things
are
so
that
a
lot
of
people
feel
they
ought
to
be
doing
something
the
weak
and
those
who
go
weak
with
a
lot
of
complicated
thinking
always
make
for
a
sort
of
donothing
religion
very
pious
and
superior
and
submit
to
persecution
and
the
will
of
the
lord

very
likely
you've
seen
the
same
thing

it's
energy
in
a
gale
of
funk
and
turned
clean
inside
out

these
cages
will
be
full
of
psalms
and
hymns
and
piety
and
those
of
a
less
simple
sort
will
work
in
a
bit
ofwhat
is
iteroticism

he
paused

very
likely
these
martians
will
make
pets
of
some
of
them
train
them
to
do
trickswho
knowsget
sentimental
over
the
pet
boy
who
grew
up
and
had
to
be
killed

and
some
maybe
they
will
train
to
hunt
us

no
I
cried
that's
impossible

no
human
being

what's
the
good
of
going
on
with
such
lies
said
the
artilleryman

there's
men
who'd
do
it
cheerful

what
nonsense
to
pretend
there
isn't

and
I
succumbed
to
his
conviction

if
they
come
after
me
he
said
lord
if
they
come
after
me
and
subsided
into
a
grim
meditation

I
sat
contemplating
these
things

I
could
find
nothing
to
bring
against
this
man's
reasoning

in
the
days
before
the
invasion
no
one
would
have
questioned
my
intellectual
superiority
to
hisi
a
professed
and
recognised
writer
on
philosophical
themes
and
he
a
common
soldier
and
yet
he
had
already
formulated
a
situation
that
I
had
scarcely
realised

what
are
you
doing
I
said
presently

what
plans
have
you
made

he
hesitated

well
it's
like
this
he
said

what
have
we
to
do

we
have
to
invent
a
sort
of
life
where
men
can
live
and
breed
and
be
sufficiently
secure
to
bring
the
children
up

yeswait
a
bit
and
i'll
make
it
clearer
what
I
think
ought
to
be
done

the
tame
ones
will
go
like
all
tame
beasts
in
a
few
generations
they'll
be
big
beautiful
richblooded
stupidrubbish
the
risk
is
that
we
who
keep
wild
will
go
savagedegenerate
into
a
sort
of
big
savage
rat



you
see
how
I
mean
to
live
is
underground

i've
been
thinking
about
the
drains

of
course
those
who
don't
know
drains
think
horrible
things
but
under
this
london
are
miles
and
mileshundreds
of
milesand
a
few
days
rain
and
london
empty
will
leave
them
sweet
and
clean
the
main
drains
are
big
enough
and
airy
enough
for
anyone
then
there's
cellars
vaults
stores
from
which
bolting
passages
may
be
made
to
the
drains
and
the
railway
tunnels
and
subways

eh

you
begin
to
see

and
we
form
a
bandablebodied
cleanminded
men
we're
not
going
to
pick
up
any
rubbish
that
drifts
in

weaklings
go
out
again

as
you
meant
me
to
go

welli
parleyed
didn't
I

we
won't
quarrel
about
that

go
on

those
who
stop
obey
orders

ablebodied
cleanminded
women
we
want
alsomothers
and
teachers

no
lackadaisical
ladiesno
blasted
rolling
eyes

we
can't
have
any
weak
or
silly

life
is
real
again
and
the
useless
and
cumbersome
and
mischievous
have
to
die

they
ought
to
die

they
ought
to
be
willing
to
die

it's
a
sort
of
disloyalty
after
all
to
live
and
taint
the
race

and
they
can't
be
happy

moreover
dying's
none
so
dreadful
it's
the
funking
makes
it
bad

and
in
all
those
places
we
shall
gather

our
district
will
be
london

and
we
may
even
be
able
to
keep
a
watch
and
run
about
in
the
open
when
the
martians
keep
away

play
cricket
perhaps

that's
how
we
shall
save
the
race

eh

it's
a
possible
thing

but
saving
the
race
is
nothing
in
itself

as
I
say
that's
only
being
rats

it's
saving
our
knowledge
and
adding
to
it
is
the
thing

there
men
like
you
come
in

there's
books
there's
models

we
must
make
great
safe
places
down
deep
and
get
all
the
books
we
can
not
novels
and
poetry
swipes
but
ideas
science
books

that's
where
men
like
you
come
in
we
must
go
to
the
british
museum
and
pick
all
those
books
through
especially
we
must
keep
up
our
sciencelearn
more

we
must
watch
these
martians

some
of
us
must
go
as
spies

when
it's
all
working
perhaps
I
will

get
caught
I
mean

and
the
great
thing
is
we
must
leave
the
martians
alone

we
mustn't
even
steal

if
we
get
in
their
way
we
clear
out

we
must
show
them
we
mean
no
harm

yes
I
know
but
they're
intelligent
things
and
they
won't
hunt
us
down
if
they
have
all
they
want
and
think
we're
just
harmless
vermin

the
artilleryman
paused
and
laid
a
brown
hand
upon
my
arm

after
all
it
may
not
be
so
much
we
may
have
to
learn
beforejust
imagine
this
four
or
five
of
their
fighting
machines
suddenly
starting
offheatrays
right
and
left
and
not
a
martian
in
'em

not
a
martian
in
'em
but
menmen
who
have
learned
the
way
how

it
may
be
in
my
time
eventhose
men

fancy
having
one
of
them
lovely
things
with
its
heatray
wide
and
free

fancy
having
it
in
control
what
would
it
matter
if
you
smashed
to
smithereens
at
the
end
of
the
run
after
a
bust
like
that

I
reckon
the
martians'll
open
their
beautiful
eyes

can't
you
see
them
man

can't
you
see
them
hurrying
hurryingpuffing
and
blowing
and
hooting
to
their
other
mechanical
affairs

something
out
of
gear
in
every
case

and
swish
bang
rattle
swish

just
as
they
are
fumbling
over
it
swish
comes
the
heatray
and
behold
man
has
come
back
to
his
own

for
a
while
the
imaginative
daring
of
the
artilleryman
and
the
tone
of
assurance
and
courage
he
assumed
completely
dominated
my
mind

I
believed
unhesitatingly
both
in
his
forecast
of
human
destiny
and
in
the
practicability
of
his
astonishing
scheme
and
the
reader
who
thinks
me
susceptible
and
foolish
must
contrast
his
position
reading
steadily
with
all
his
thoughts
about
his
subject
and
mine
crouching
fearfully
in
the
bushes
and
listening
distracted
by
apprehension

we
talked
in
this
manner
through
the
early
morning
time
and
later
crept
out
of
the
bushes
and
after
scanning
the
sky
for
martians
hurried
precipitately
to
the
house
on
putney
hill
where
he
had
made
his
lair

it
was
the
coal
cellar
of
the
place
and
when
I
saw
the
work
he
had
spent
a
week
uponit
was
a
burrow
scarcely
ten
yards
long
which
he
designed
to
reach
to
the
main
drain
on
putney
hilli
had
my
first
inkling
of
the
gulf
between
his
dreams
and
his
powers

such
a
hole
I
could
have
dug
in
a
day

but
I
believed
in
him
sufficiently
to
work
with
him
all
that
morning
until
past
midday
at
his
digging

we
had
a
garden
barrow
and
shot
the
earth
we
removed
against
the
kitchen
range

we
refreshed
ourselves
with
a
tin
of
mockturtle
soup
and
wine
from
the
neighbouring
pantry

I
found
a
curious
relief
from
the
aching
strangeness
of
the
world
in
this
steady
labour
as
we
worked
I
turned
his
project
over
in
my
mind
and
presently
objections
and
doubts
began
to
arise
but
I
worked
there
all
the
morning
so
glad
was
I
to
find
myself
with
a
purpose
again

after
working
an
hour
I
began
to
speculate
on
the
distance
one
had
to
go
before
the
cloaca
was
reached
the
chances
we
had
of
missing
it
altogether

my
immediate
trouble
was
why
we
should
dig
this
long
tunnel
when
it
was
possible
to
get
into
the
drain
at
once
down
one
of
the
manholes
and
work
back
to
the
house

it
seemed
to
me
too
that
the
house
was
inconveniently
chosen
and
required
a
needless
length
of
tunnel

and
just
as
I
was
beginning
to
face
these
things
the
artilleryman
stopped
digging
and
looked
at
me

we're
working
well
he
said

he
put
down
his
spade
let
us
knock
off
a
bit
he
said

I
think
it's
time
we
reconnoitred
from
the
roof
of
the
house

I
was
for
going
on
and
after
a
little
hesitation
he
resumed
his
spade
and
then
suddenly
I
was
struck
by
a
thought

I
stopped
and
so
did
he
at
once

why
were
you
walking
about
the
common
I
said
instead
of
being
here

taking
the
air
he
said

I
was
coming
back

it's
safer
by
night

but
the
work

oh
one
can't
always
work
he
said
and
in
a
flash
I
saw
the
man
plain

he
hesitated
holding
his
spade

we
ought
to
reconnoitre
now
he
said
because
if
any
come
near
they
may
hear
the
spades
and
drop
upon
us
unawares

I
was
no
longer
disposed
to
object

we
went
together
to
the
roof
and
stood
on
a
ladder
peeping
out
of
the
roof
door

no
martians
were
to
be
seen
and
we
ventured
out
on
the
tiles
and
slipped
down
under
shelter
of
the
parapet

from
this
position
a
shrubbery
hid
the
greater
portion
of
putney
but
we
could
see
the
river
below
a
bubbly
mass
of
red
weed
and
the
low
parts
of
lambeth
flooded
and
red

the
red
creeper
swarmed
up
the
trees
about
the
old
palace
and
their
branches
stretched
gaunt
and
dead
and
set
with
shrivelled
leaves
from
amid
its
clusters

it
was
strange
how
entirely
dependent
both
these
things
were
upon
flowing
water
for
their
propagation

about
us
neither
had
gained
a
footing
laburnums
pink
mays
snowballs
and
trees
of
arborvitae
rose
out
of
laurels
and
hydrangeas
green
and
brilliant
into
the
sunlight

beyond
kensington
dense
smoke
was
rising
and
that
and
a
blue
haze
hid
the
northward
hills

the
artilleryman
began
to
tell
me
of
the
sort
of
people
who
still
remained
in
london

one
night
last
week
he
said
some
fools
got
the
electric
light
in
order
and
there
was
all
regent
street
and
the
circus
ablaze
crowded
with
painted
and
ragged
drunkards
men
and
women
dancing
and
shouting
till
dawn

a
man
who
was
there
told
me

and
as
the
day
came
they
became
aware
of
a
fightingmachine
standing
near
by
the
langham
and
looking
down
at
them

heaven
knows
how
long
he
had
been
there
it
must
have
given
some
of
them
a
nasty
turn

he
came
down
the
road
towards
them
and
picked
up
nearly
a
hundred
too
drunk
or
frightened
to
run
away

grotesque
gleam
of
a
time
no
history
will
ever
fully
describe

from
that
in
answer
to
my
questions
he
came
round
to
his
grandiose
plans
again

he
grew
enthusiastic

he
talked
so
eloquently
of
the
possibility
of
capturing
a
fightingmachine
that
I
more
than
half
believed
in
him
again

but
now
that
I
was
beginning
to
understand
something
of
his
quality
I
could
divine
the
stress
he
laid
on
doing
nothing
precipitately

and
I
noted
that
now
there
was
no
question
that
he
personally
was
to
capture
and
fight
the
great
machine

after
a
time
we
went
down
to
the
cellar

neither
of
us
seemed
disposed
to
resume
digging
and
when
he
suggested
a
meal
I
was
nothing
loath

he
became
suddenly
very
generous
and
when
we
had
eaten
he
went
away
and
returned
with
some
excellent
cigars

we
lit
these
and
his
optimism
glowed

he
was
inclined
to
regard
my
coming
as
a
great
occasion

there's
some
champagne
in
the
cellar
he
said

we
can
dig
better
on
this
thamesside
burgundy
said
I

no
said
he
I
am
host
today

champagne

great
god
we've
a
heavy
enough
task
before
us

let
us
take
a
rest
and
gather
strength
while
we
may

look
at
these
blistered
hands

and
pursuant
to
this
idea
of
a
holiday
he
insisted
upon
playing
cards
after
we
had
eaten

he
taught
me
euchre
and
after
dividing
london
between
us
I
taking
the
northern
side
and
he
the
southern
we
played
for
parish
points

grotesque
and
foolish
as
this
will
seem
to
the
sober
reader
it
is
absolutely
true
and
what
is
more
remarkable
I
found
the
card
game
and
several
others
we
played
extremely
interesting

strange
mind
of
man
that
with
our
species
upon
the
edge
of
extermination
or
appalling
degradation
with
no
clear
prospect
before
us
but
the
chance
of
a
horrible
death
we
could
sit
following
the
chance
of
this
painted
pasteboard
and
playing
the
joker
with
vivid
delight

afterwards
he
taught
me
poker
and
I
beat
him
at
three
tough
chess
games

when
dark
came
we
decided
to
take
the
risk
and
lit
a
lamp

after
an
interminable
string
of
games
we
supped
and
the
artilleryman
finished
the
champagne

we
went
on
smoking
the
cigars
he
was
no
longer
the
energetic
regenerator
of
his
species
I
had
encountered
in
the
morning

he
was
still
optimistic
but
it
was
a
less
kinetic
a
more
thoughtful
optimism

I
remember
he
wound
up
with
my
health
proposed
in
a
speech
of
small
variety
and
considerable
intermittence

I
took
a
cigar
and
went
upstairs
to
look
at
the
lights
of
which
he
had
spoken
that
blazed
so
greenly
along
the
highgate
hills

at
first
I
stared
unintelligently
across
the
london
valley

the
northern
hills
were
shrouded
in
darkness
the
fires
near
kensington
glowed
redly
and
now
and
then
an
orangered
tongue
of
flame
flashed
up
and
vanished
in
the
deep
blue
night

all
the
rest
of
london
was
black

then
nearer
I
perceived
a
strange
light
a
pale
violetpurple
fluorescent
glow
quivering
under
the
night
breeze

for
a
space
I
could
not
understand
it
and
then
I
knew
that
it
must
be
the
red
weed
from
which
this
faint
irradiation
proceeded

with
that
realisation
my
dormant
sense
of
wonder
my
sense
of
the
proportion
of
things
awoke
again

I
glanced
from
that
to
mars
red
and
clear
glowing
high
in
the
west
and
then
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
darkness
of
hampstead
and
highgate

I
remained
a
very
long
time
upon
the
roof
wondering
at
the
grotesque
changes
of
the
day

I
recalled
my
mental
states
from
the
midnight
prayer
to
the
foolish
cardplaying

I
had
a
violent
revulsion
of
feeling

I
remember
I
flung
away
the
cigar
with
a
certain
wasteful
symbolism

my
folly
came
to
me
with
glaring
exaggeration

I
seemed
a
traitor
to
my
wife
and
to
my
kind
I
was
filled
with
remorse

I
resolved
to
leave
this
strange
undisciplined
dreamer
of
great
things
to
his
drink
and
gluttony
and
to
go
on
into
london

there
it
seemed
to
me
I
had
the
best
chance
of
learning
what
the
martians
and
my
fellowmen
were
doing

I
was
still
upon
the
roof
when
the
late
moon
rose



chapter

dead
london


after
I
had
parted
from
the
artilleryman
I
went
down
the
hill
and
by
the
high
street
across
the
bridge
to
fulham

the
red
weed
was
tumultuous
at
that
time
and
nearly
choked
the
bridge
roadway
but
its
fronds
were
already
whitened
in
patches
by
the
spreading
disease
that
presently
removed
it
so
swiftly

at
the
corner
of
the
lane
that
runs
to
putney
bridge
station
I
found
a
man
lying

he
was
as
black
as
a
sweep
with
the
black
dust
alive
but
helplessly
and
speechlessly
drunk

I
could
get
nothing
from
him
but
curses
and
furious
lunges
at
my
head

I
think
I
should
have
stayed
by
him
but
for
the
brutal
expression
of
his
face

there
was
black
dust
along
the
roadway
from
the
bridge
onwards
and
it
grew
thicker
in
fulham

the
streets
were
horribly
quiet

I
got
foodsour
hard
and
mouldy
but
quite
eatablein
a
baker's
shop
here

some
way
towards
walham
green
the
streets
became
clear
of
powder
and
I
passed
a
white
terrace
of
houses
on
fire
the
noise
of
the
burning
was
an
absolute
relief

going
on
towards
brompton
the
streets
were
quiet
again

here
I
came
once
more
upon
the
black
powder
in
the
streets
and
upon
dead
bodies

I
saw
altogether
about
a
dozen
in
the
length
of
the
fulham
road

they
had
been
dead
many
days
so
that
I
hurried
quickly
past
them

the
black
powder
covered
them
over
and
softened
their
outlines

one
or
two
had
been
disturbed
by
dogs

where
there
was
no
black
powder
it
was
curiously
like
a
sunday
in
the
city
with
the
closed
shops
the
houses
locked
up
and
the
blinds
drawn
the
desertion
and
the
stillness

in
some
places
plunderers
had
been
at
work
but
rarely
at
other
than
the
provision
and
wine
shops

a
jeweller's
window
had
been
broken
open
in
one
place
but
apparently
the
thief
had
been
disturbed
and
a
number
of
gold
chains
and
a
watch
lay
scattered
on
the
pavement

I
did
not
trouble
to
touch
them

farther
on
was
a
tattered
woman
in
a
heap
on
a
doorstep
the
hand
that
hung
over
her
knee
was
gashed
and
bled
down
her
rusty
brown
dress
and
a
smashed
magnum
of
champagne
formed
a
pool
across
the
pavement

she
seemed
asleep
but
she
was
dead

the
farther
I
penetrated
into
london
the
profounder
grew
the
stillness

but
it
was
not
so
much
the
stillness
of
deathit
was
the
stillness
of
suspense
of
expectation

at
any
time
the
destruction
that
had
already
singed
the
northwestern
borders
of
the
metropolis
and
had
annihilated
ealing
and
kilburn
might
strike
among
these
houses
and
leave
them
smoking
ruins

it
was
a
city
condemned
and
derelict




in
south
kensington
the
streets
were
clear
of
dead
and
of
black
powder

it
was
near
south
kensington
that
I
first
heard
the
howling
it
crept
almost
imperceptibly
upon
my
senses

it
was
a
sobbing
alternation
of
two
notes
ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
keeping
on
perpetually

when
I
passed
streets
that
ran
northward
it
grew
in
volume
and
houses
and
buildings
seemed
to
deaden
and
cut
it
off
again

it
came
in
a
full
tide
down
exhibition
road

I
stopped
staring
towards
kensington
gardens
wondering
at
this
strange
remote
wailing

it
was
as
if
that
mighty
desert
of
houses
had
found
a
voice
for
its
fear
and
solitude

ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
wailed
that
superhuman
notegreat
waves
of
sound
sweeping
down
the
broad
sunlit
roadway
between
the
tall
buildings
on
each
side

I
turned
northwards
marvelling
towards
the
iron
gates
of
hyde
park

I
had
half
a
mind
to
break
into
the
natural
history
museum
and
find
my
way
up
to
the
summits
of
the
towers
in
order
to
see
across
the
park

but
I
decided
to
keep
to
the
ground
where
quick
hiding
was
possible
and
so
went
on
up
the
exhibition
road

all
the
large
mansions
on
each
side
of
the
road
were
empty
and
still
and
my
footsteps
echoed
against
the
sides
of
the
houses

at
the
top
near
the
park
gate
I
came
upon
a
strange
sighta
bus
overturned
and
the
skeleton
of
a
horse
picked
clean

I
puzzled
over
this
for
a
time
and
then
went
on
to
the
bridge
over
the
serpentine
the
voice
grew
stronger
and
stronger
though
I
could
see
nothing
above
the
housetops
on
the
north
side
of
the
park
save
a
haze
of
smoke
to
the
northwest

ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
cried
the
voice
coming
as
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
district
about
regent's
park

the
desolating
cry
worked
upon
my
mind

the
mood
that
had
sustained
me
passed

the
wailing
took
possession
of
me

I
found
I
was
intensely
weary
footsore
and
now
again
hungry
and
thirsty

it
was
already
past
noon

why
was
I
wandering
alone
in
this
city
of
the
dead

why
was
I
alone
when
all
london
was
lying
in
state
and
in
its
black
shroud

I
felt
intolerably
lonely

my
mind
ran
on
old
friends
that
I
had
forgotten
for
years

I
thought
of
the
poisons
in
the
chemists'
shops
of
the
liquors
the
wine
merchants
stored
I
recalled
the
two
sodden
creatures
of
despair
who
so
far
as
I
knew
shared
the
city
with
myself




I
came
into
oxford
street
by
the
marble
arch
and
here
again
were
black
powder
and
several
bodies
and
an
evil
ominous
smell
from
the
gratings
of
the
cellars
of
some
of
the
houses

I
grew
very
thirsty
after
the
heat
of
my
long
walk

with
infinite
trouble
I
managed
to
break
into
a
publichouse
and
get
food
and
drink

I
was
weary
after
eating
and
went
into
the
parlour
behind
the
bar
and
slept
on
a
black
horsehair
sofa
I
found
there

I
awoke
to
find
that
dismal
howling
still
in
my
ears
ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla

it
was
now
dusk
and
after
I
had
routed
out
some
biscuits
and
a
cheese
in
the
barthere
was
a
meat
safe
but
it
contained
nothing
but
maggotsi
wandered
on
through
the
silent
residential
squares
to
baker
streetportman
square
is
the
only
one
I
can
nameand
so
came
out
at
last
upon
regent's
park

and
as
I
emerged
from
the
top
of
baker
street
I
saw
far
away
over
the
trees
in
the
clearness
of
the
sunset
the
hood
of
the
martian
giant
from
which
this
howling
proceeded

I
was
not
terrified

I
came
upon
him
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
course

I
watched
him
for
some
time
but
he
did
not
move

he
appeared
to
be
standing
and
yelling
for
no
reason
that
I
could
discover

I
tried
to
formulate
a
plan
of
action

that
perpetual
sound
of
ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
confused
my
mind

perhaps
I
was
too
tired
to
be
very
fearful

certainly
I
was
more
curious
to
know
the
reason
of
this
monotonous
crying
than
afraid

I
turned
back
away
from
the
park
and
struck
into
park
road
intending
to
skirt
the
park
went
along
under
the
shelter
of
the
terraces
and
got
a
view
of
this
stationary
howling
martian
from
the
direction
of
st
john's
wood

a
couple
of
hundred
yards
out
of
baker
street
I
heard
a
yelping
chorus
and
saw
first
a
dog
with
a
piece
of
putrescent
red
meat
in
his
jaws
coming
headlong
towards
me
and
then
a
pack
of
starving
mongrels
in
pursuit
of
him

he
made
a
wide
curve
to
avoid
me
as
though
he
feared
I
might
prove
a
fresh
competitor

as
the
yelping
died
away
down
the
silent
road
the
wailing
sound
of
ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
reasserted
itself

I
came
upon
the
wrecked
handlingmachine
halfway
to
st
john's
wood
station

at
first
I
thought
a
house
had
fallen
across
the
road

it
was
only
as
I
clambered
among
the
ruins
that
I
saw
with
a
start
this
mechanical
samson
lying
with
its
tentacles
bent
and
smashed
and
twisted
among
the
ruins
it
had
made

the
forepart
was
shattered

it
seemed
as
if
it
had
driven
blindly
straight
at
the
house
and
had
been
overwhelmed
in
its
overthrow

it
seemed
to
me
then
that
this
might
have
happened
by
a
handlingmachine
escaping
from
the
guidance
of
its
martian

I
could
not
clamber
among
the
ruins
to
see
it
and
the
twilight
was
now
so
far
advanced
that
the
blood
with
which
its
seat
was
smeared
and
the
gnawed
gristle
of
the
martian
that
the
dogs
had
left
were
invisible
to
me

wondering
still
more
at
all
that
I
had
seen
I
pushed
on
towards
primrose
hill

far
away
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
I
saw
a
second
martian
as
motionless
as
the
first
standing
in
the
park
towards
the
zoological
gardens
and
silent

a
little
beyond
the
ruins
about
the
smashed
handlingmachine
I
came
upon
the
red
weed
again
and
found
the
regent's
canal
a
spongy
mass
of
darkred
vegetation

as
I
crossed
the
bridge
the
sound
of
ulla
ulla
ulla
ulla
ceased

it
was
as
it
were
cut
off

the
silence
came
like
a
thunderclap

the
dusky
houses
about
me
stood
faint
and
tall
and
dim
the
trees
towards
the
park
were
growing
black

all
about
me
the
red
weed
clambered
among
the
ruins
writhing
to
get
above
me
in
the
dimness
night
the
mother
of
fear
and
mystery
was
coming
upon
me

but
while
that
voice
sounded
the
solitude
the
desolation
had
been
endurable
by
virtue
of
it
london
had
still
seemed
alive
and
the
sense
of
life
about
me
had
upheld
me

then
suddenly
a
change
the
passing
of
somethingi
knew
not
whatand
then
a
stillness
that
could
be
felt
nothing
but
this
gaunt
quiet

london
about
me
gazed
at
me
spectrally

the
windows
in
the
white
houses
were
like
the
eye
sockets
of
skulls

about
me
my
imagination
found
a
thousand
noiseless
enemies
moving

terror
seized
me
a
horror
of
my
temerity

in
front
of
me
the
road
became
pitchy
black
as
though
it
was
tarred
and
I
saw
a
contorted
shape
lying
across
the
pathway

I
could
not
bring
myself
to
go
on

I
turned
down
st
john's
wood
road
and
ran
headlong
from
this
unendurable
stillness
towards
kilburn

I
hid
from
the
night
and
the
silence
until
long
after
midnight
in
a
cabmen's
shelter
in
harrow
road

but
before
the
dawn
my
courage
returned
and
while
the
stars
were
still
in
the
sky
I
turned
once
more
towards
regent's
park

I
missed
my
way
among
the
streets
and
presently
saw
down
a
long
avenue
in
the
halflight
of
the
early
dawn
the
curve
of
primrose
hill

on
the
summit
towering
up
to
the
fading
stars
was
a
third
martian
erect
and
motionless
like
the
others

an
insane
resolve
possessed
me

I
would
die
and
end
it

and
I
would
save
myself
even
the
trouble
of
killing
myself

I
marched
on
recklessly
towards
this
titan
and
then
as
I
drew
nearer
and
the
light
grew
I
saw
that
a
multitude
of
black
birds
was
circling
and
clustering
about
the
hood

at
that
my
heart
gave
a
bound
and
I
began
running
along
the
road

I
hurried
through
the
red
weed
that
choked
st
edmund's
terrace
I
waded
breasthigh
across
a
torrent
of
water
that
was
rushing
down
from
the
waterworks
towards
the
albert
road
and
emerged
upon
the
grass
before
the
rising
of
the
sun

great
mounds
had
been
heaped
about
the
crest
of
the
hill
making
a
huge
redoubt
of
itit
was
the
final
and
largest
place
the
martians
had
madeand
from
behind
these
heaps
there
rose
a
thin
smoke
against
the
sky

against
the
sky
line
an
eager
dog
ran
and
disappeared

the
thought
that
had
flashed
into
my
mind
grew
real
grew
credible

I
felt
no
fear
only
a
wild
trembling
exultation
as
I
ran
up
the
hill
towards
the
motionless
monster

out
of
the
hood
hung
lank
shreds
of
brown
at
which
the
hungry
birds
pecked
and
tore

in
another
moment
I
had
scrambled
up
the
earthen
rampart
and
stood
upon
its
crest
and
the
interior
of
the
redoubt
was
below
me

a
mighty
space
it
was
with
gigantic
machines
here
and
there
within
it
huge
mounds
of
material
and
strange
shelter
places

and
scattered
about
it
some
in
their
overturned
warmachines
some
in
the
now
rigid
handlingmachines
and
a
dozen
of
them
stark
and
silent
and
laid
in
a
row
were
the
martiansdeadslain
by
the
putrefactive
and
disease
bacteria
against
which
their
systems
were
unprepared
slain
as
the
red
weed
was
being
slain
slain
after
all
man's
devices
had
failed
by
the
humblest
things
that
god
in
his
wisdom
has
put
upon
this
earth

for
so
it
had
come
about
as
indeed
I
and
many
men
might
have
foreseen
had
not
terror
and
disaster
blinded
our
minds

these
germs
of
disease
have
taken
toll
of
humanity
since
the
beginning
of
thingstaken
toll
of
our
prehuman
ancestors
since
life
began
here
but
by
virtue
of
this
natural
selection
of
our
kind
we
have
developed
resisting
power
to
no
germs
do
we
succumb
without
a
struggle
and
to
manythose
that
cause
putrefaction
in
dead
matter
for
instanceour
living
frames
are
altogether
immune

but
there
are
no
bacteria
in
mars
and
directly
these
invaders
arrived
directly
they
drank
and
fed
our
microscopic
allies
began
to
work
their
overthrow

already
when
I
watched
them
they
were
irrevocably
doomed
dying
and
rotting
even
as
they
went
to
and
fro

it
was
inevitable

by
the
toll
of
a
billion
deaths
man
has
bought
his
birthright
of
the
earth
and
it
is
his
against
all
comers
it
would
still
be
his
were
the
martians
ten
times
as
mighty
as
they
are

for
neither
do
men
live
nor
die
in
vain

here
and
there
they
were
scattered
nearly
fifty
altogether
in
that
great
gulf
they
had
made
overtaken
by
a
death
that
must
have
seemed
to
them
as
incomprehensible
as
any
death
could
be

to
me
also
at
that
time
this
death
was
incomprehensible

all
I
knew
was
that
these
things
that
had
been
alive
and
so
terrible
to
men
were
dead
for
a
moment
I
believed
that
the
destruction
of
sennacherib
had
been
repeated
that
god
had
repented
that
the
angel
of
death
had
slain
them
in
the
night

I
stood
staring
into
the
pit
and
my
heart
lightened
gloriously
even
as
the
rising
sun
struck
the
world
to
fire
about
me
with
his
rays

the
pit
was
still
in
darkness
the
mighty
engines
so
great
and
wonderful
in
their
power
and
complexity
so
unearthly
in
their
tortuous
forms
rose
weird
and
vague
and
strange
out
of
the
shadows
towards
the
light

a
multitude
of
dogs
I
could
hear
fought
over
the
bodies
that
lay
darkly
in
the
depth
of
the
pit
far
below
me

across
the
pit
on
its
farther
lip
flat
and
vast
and
strange
lay
the
great
flyingmachine
with
which
they
had
been
experimenting
upon
our
denser
atmosphere
when
decay
and
death
arrested
them

death
had
come
not
a
day
too
soon

at
the
sound
of
a
cawing
overhead
I
looked
up
at
the
huge
fightingmachine
that
would
fight
no
more
for
ever
at
the
tattered
red
shreds
of
flesh
that
dripped
down
upon
the
overturned
seats
on
the
summit
of
primrose
hill

I
turned
and
looked
down
the
slope
of
the
hill
to
where
enhaloed
now
in
birds
stood
those
other
two
martians
that
I
had
seen
overnight
just
as
death
had
overtaken
them

the
one
had
died
even
as
it
had
been
crying
to
its
companions
perhaps
it
was
the
last
to
die
and
its
voice
had
gone
on
perpetually
until
the
force
of
its
machinery
was
exhausted

they
glittered
now
harmless
tripod
towers
of
shining
metal
in
the
brightness
of
the
rising
sun

all
about
the
pit
and
saved
as
by
a
miracle
from
everlasting
destruction
stretched
the
great
mother
of
cities

those
who
have
only
seen
london
veiled
in
her
sombre
robes
of
smoke
can
scarcely
imagine
the
naked
clearness
and
beauty
of
the
silent
wilderness
of
houses

eastward
over
the
blackened
ruins
of
the
albert
terrace
and
the
splintered
spire
of
the
church
the
sun
blazed
dazzling
in
a
clear
sky
and
here
and
there
some
facet
in
the
great
wilderness
of
roofs
caught
the
light
and
glared
with
a
white
intensity

northward
were
kilburn
and
hampsted
blue
and
crowded
with
houses
westward
the
great
city
was
dimmed
and
southward
beyond
the
martians
the
green
waves
of
regent's
park
the
langham
hotel
the
dome
of
the
albert
hall
the
imperial
institute
and
the
giant
mansions
of
the
brompton
road
came
out
clear
and
little
in
the
sunrise
the
jagged
ruins
of
westminster
rising
hazily
beyond

far
away
and
blue
were
the
surrey
hills
and
the
towers
of
the
crystal
palace
glittered
like
two
silver
rods

the
dome
of
st
paul's
was
dark
against
the
sunrise
and
injured
I
saw
for
the
first
time
by
a
huge
gaping
cavity
on
its
western
side

and
as
I
looked
at
this
wide
expanse
of
houses
and
factories
and
churches
silent
and
abandoned
as
I
thought
of
the
multitudinous
hopes
and
efforts
the
innumerable
hosts
of
lives
that
had
gone
to
build
this
human
reef
and
of
the
swift
and
ruthless
destruction
that
had
hung
over
it
all
when
I
realised
that
the
shadow
had
been
rolled
back
and
that
men
might
still
live
in
the
streets
and
this
dear
vast
dead
city
of
mine
be
once
more
alive
and
powerful
I
felt
a
wave
of
emotion
that
was
near
akin
to
tears

the
torment
was
over

even
that
day
the
healing
would
begin

the
survivors
of
the
people
scattered
over
the
countryleaderless
lawless
foodless
like
sheep
without
a
shepherdthe
thousands
who
had
fled
by
sea
would
begin
to
return
the
pulse
of
life
growing
stronger
and
stronger
would
beat
again
in
the
empty
streets
and
pour
across
the
vacant
squares

whatever
destruction
was
done
the
hand
of
the
destroyer
was
stayed

all
the
gaunt
wrecks
the
blackened
skeletons
of
houses
that
stared
so
dismally
at
the
sunlit
grass
of
the
hill
would
presently
be
echoing
with
the
hammers
of
the
restorers
and
ringing
with
the
tapping
of
their
trowels

at
the
thought
I
extended
my
hands
towards
the
sky
and
began
thanking
god

in
a
year
thought
iin
a
year



with
overwhelming
force
came
the
thought
of
myself
of
my
wife
and
the
old
life
of
hope
and
tender
helpfulness
that
had
ceased
for
ever



chapter

wreckage


and
now
comes
the
strangest
thing
in
my
story

yet
perhaps
it
is
not
altogether
strange

I
remember
clearly
and
coldly
and
vividly
all
that
I
did
that
day
until
the
time
that
I
stood
weeping
and
praising
god
upon
the
summit
of
primrose
hill

and
then
I
forget

of
the
next
three
days
I
know
nothing

I
have
learned
since
that
so
far
from
my
being
the
first
discoverer
of
the
martian
overthrow
several
such
wanderers
as
myself
had
already
discovered
this
on
the
previous
night

one
manthe
firsthad
gone
to
st
martin'slegrand
and
while
I
sheltered
in
the
cabmen's
hut
had
contrived
to
telegraph
to
paris

thence
the
joyful
news
had
flashed
all
over
the
world
a
thousand
cities
chilled
by
ghastly
apprehensions
suddenly
flashed
into
frantic
illuminations
they
knew
of
it
in
dublin
edinburgh
manchester
birmingham
at
the
time
when
I
stood
upon
the
verge
of
the
pit

already
men
weeping
with
joy
as
I
have
heard
shouting
and
staying
their
work
to
shake
hands
and
shout
were
making
up
trains
even
as
near
as
crewe
to
descend
upon
london

the
church
bells
that
had
ceased
a
fortnight
since
suddenly
caught
the
news
until
all
england
was
bellringing

men
on
cycles
leanfaced
unkempt
scorched
along
every
country
lane
shouting
of
unhoped
deliverance
shouting
to
gaunt
staring
figures
of
despair

and
for
the
food

across
the
channel
across
the
irish
sea
across
the
atlantic
corn
bread
and
meat
were
tearing
to
our
relief

all
the
shipping
in
the
world
seemed
going
londonward
in
those
days

but
of
all
this
I
have
no
memory

I
drifteda
demented
man

I
found
myself
in
a
house
of
kindly
people
who
had
found
me
on
the
third
day
wandering
weeping
and
raving
through
the
streets
of
st
john's
wood
they
have
told
me
since
that
I
was
singing
some
insane
doggerel
about
the
last
man
left
alive
hurrah

the
last
man
left
alive

troubled
as
they
were
with
their
own
affairs
these
people
whose
name
much
as
I
would
like
to
express
my
gratitude
to
them
I
may
not
even
give
here
nevertheless
cumbered
themselves
with
me
sheltered
me
and
protected
me
from
myself

apparently
they
had
learned
something
of
my
story
from
me
during
the
days
of
my
lapse

very
gently
when
my
mind
was
assured
again
did
they
break
to
me
what
they
had
learned
of
the
fate
of
leatherhead

two
days
after
I
was
imprisoned
it
had
been
destroyed
with
every
soul
in
it
by
a
martian

he
had
swept
it
out
of
existence
as
it
seemed
without
any
provocation
as
a
boy
might
crush
an
ant
hill
in
the
mere
wantonness
of
power

I
was
a
lonely
man
and
they
were
very
kind
to
me

I
was
a
lonely
man
and
a
sad
one
and
they
bore
with
me

I
remained
with
them
four
days
after
my
recovery

all
that
time
I
felt
a
vague
a
growing
craving
to
look
once
more
on
whatever
remained
of
the
little
life
that
seemed
so
happy
and
bright
in
my
past

it
was
a
mere
hopeless
desire
to
feast
upon
my
misery

they
dissuaded
me

they
did
all
they
could
to
divert
me
from
this
morbidity

but
at
last
I
could
resist
the
impulse
no
longer
and
promising
faithfully
to
return
to
them
and
parting
as
I
will
confess
from
these
fourday
friends
with
tears
I
went
out
again
into
the
streets
that
had
lately
been
so
dark
and
strange
and
empty

already
they
were
busy
with
returning
people
in
places
even
there
were
shops
open
and
I
saw
a
drinking
fountain
running
water

I
remember
how
mockingly
bright
the
day
seemed
as
I
went
back
on
my
melancholy
pilgrimage
to
the
little
house
at
woking
how
busy
the
streets
and
vivid
the
moving
life
about
me

so
many
people
were
abroad
everywhere
busied
in
a
thousand
activities
that
it
seemed
incredible
that
any
great
proportion
of
the
population
could
have
been
slain

but
then
I
noticed
how
yellow
were
the
skins
of
the
people
I
met
how
shaggy
the
hair
of
the
men
how
large
and
bright
their
eyes
and
that
every
other
man
still
wore
his
dirty
rags

their
faces
seemed
all
with
one
of
two
expressionsa
leaping
exultation
and
energy
or
a
grim
resolution

save
for
the
expression
of
the
faces
london
seemed
a
city
of
tramps

the
vestries
were
indiscriminately
distributing
bread
sent
us
by
the
french
government

the
ribs
of
the
few
horses
showed
dismally

haggard
special
constables
with
white
badges
stood
at
the
corners
of
every
street

I
saw
little
of
the
mischief
wrought
by
the
martians
until
I
reached
wellington
street
and
there
I
saw
the
red
weed
clambering
over
the
buttresses
of
waterloo
bridge

at
the
corner
of
the
bridge
too
I
saw
one
of
the
common
contrasts
of
that
grotesque
timea
sheet
of
paper
flaunting
against
a
thicket
of
the
red
weed
transfixed
by
a
stick
that
kept
it
in
place

it
was
the
placard
of
the
first
newspaper
to
resume
publicationthe
daily
mail

I
bought
a
copy
for
a
blackened
shilling
I
found
in
my
pocket
most
of
it
was
in
blank
but
the
solitary
compositor
who
did
the
thing
had
amused
himself
by
making
a
grotesque
scheme
of
advertisement
stereo
on
the
back
page

the
matter
he
printed
was
emotional
the
news
organisation
had
not
as
yet
found
its
way
back

I
learned
nothing
fresh
except
that
already
in
one
week
the
examination
of
the
martian
mechanisms
had
yielded
astonishing
results

among
other
things
the
article
assured
me
what
I
did
not
believe
at
the
time
that
the
secret
of
flying
was
discovered

at
waterloo
I
found
the
free
trains
that
were
taking
people
to
their
homes

the
first
rush
was
already
over

there
were
few
people
in
the
train
and
I
was
in
no
mood
for
casual
conversation

I
got
a
compartment
to
myself
and
sat
with
folded
arms
looking
greyly
at
the
sunlit
devastation
that
flowed
past
the
windows

and
just
outside
the
terminus
the
train
jolted
over
temporary
rails
and
on
either
side
of
the
railway
the
houses
were
blackened
ruins

to
clapham
junction
the
face
of
london
was
grimy
with
powder
of
the
black
smoke
in
spite
of
two
days
of
thunderstorms
and
rain
and
at
clapham
junction
the
line
had
been
wrecked
again
there
were
hundreds
of
outofwork
clerks
and
shopmen
working
side
by
side
with
the
customary
navvies
and
we
were
jolted
over
a
hasty
relaying

all
down
the
line
from
there
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
gaunt
and
unfamiliar
wimbledon
particularly
had
suffered

walton
by
virtue
of
its
unburned
pine
woods
seemed
the
least
hurt
of
any
place
along
the
line

the
wandle
the
mole
every
little
stream
was
a
heaped
mass
of
red
weed
in
appearance
between
butcher's
meat
and
pickled
cabbage

the
surrey
pine
woods
were
too
dry
however
for
the
festoons
of
the
red
climber

beyond
wimbledon
within
sight
of
the
line
in
certain
nursery
grounds
were
the
heaped
masses
of
earth
about
the
sixth
cylinder

a
number
of
people
were
standing
about
it
and
some
sappers
were
busy
in
the
midst
of
it

over
it
flaunted
a
union
jack
flapping
cheerfully
in
the
morning
breeze

the
nursery
grounds
were
everywhere
crimson
with
the
weed
a
wide
expanse
of
livid
colour
cut
with
purple
shadows
and
very
painful
to
the
eye

one's
gaze
went
with
infinite
relief
from
the
scorched
greys
and
sullen
reds
of
the
foreground
to
the
bluegreen
softness
of
the
eastward
hills

the
line
on
the
london
side
of
woking
station
was
still
undergoing
repair
so
I
descended
at
byfleet
station
and
took
the
road
to
maybury
past
the
place
where
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
talked
to
the
hussars
and
on
by
the
spot
where
the
martian
had
appeared
to
me
in
the
thunderstorm

here
moved
by
curiosity
I
turned
aside
to
find
among
a
tangle
of
red
fronds
the
warped
and
broken
dog
cart
with
the
whitened
bones
of
the
horse
scattered
and
gnawed

for
a
time
I
stood
regarding
these
vestiges




then
I
returned
through
the
pine
wood
neckhigh
with
red
weed
here
and
there
to
find
the
landlord
of
the
spotted
dog
had
already
found
burial
and
so
came
home
past
the
college
arms

a
man
standing
at
an
open
cottage
door
greeted
me
by
name
as
I
passed

I
looked
at
my
house
with
a
quick
flash
of
hope
that
faded
immediately

the
door
had
been
forced
it
was
unfast
and
was
opening
slowly
as
I
approached

it
slammed
again

the
curtains
of
my
study
fluttered
out
of
the
open
window
from
which
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
watched
the
dawn

no
one
had
closed
it
since

the
smashed
bushes
were
just
as
I
had
left
them
nearly
four
weeks
ago

I
stumbled
into
the
hall
and
the
house
felt
empty

the
stair
carpet
was
ruffled
and
discoloured
where
I
had
crouched
soaked
to
the
skin
from
the
thunderstorm
the
night
of
the
catastrophe

our
muddy
footsteps
I
saw
still
went
up
the
stairs

I
followed
them
to
my
study
and
found
lying
on
my
writingtable
still
with
the
selenite
paper
weight
upon
it
the
sheet
of
work
I
had
left
on
the
afternoon
of
the
opening
of
the
cylinder

for
a
space
I
stood
reading
over
my
abandoned
arguments

it
was
a
paper
on
the
probable
development
of
moral
ideas
with
the
development
of
the
civilising
process
and
the
last
sentence
was
the
opening
of
a
prophecy
in
about
two
hundred
years
I
had
written
we
may
expect

the
sentence
ended
abruptly

I
remembered
my
inability
to
fix
my
mind
that
morning
scarcely
a
month
gone
by
and
how
I
had
broken
off
to
get
my
daily
chronicle
from
the
newsboy

I
remembered
how
I
went
down
to
the
garden
gate
as
he
came
along
and
how
I
had
listened
to
his
odd
story
of
men
from
mars

I
came
down
and
went
into
the
dining
room

there
were
the
mutton
and
the
bread
both
far
gone
now
in
decay
and
a
beer
bottle
overturned
just
as
I
and
the
artilleryman
had
left
them

my
home
was
desolate

I
perceived
the
folly
of
the
faint
hope
I
had
cherished
so
long

and
then
a
strange
thing
occurred

it
is
no
use
said
a
voice

the
house
is
deserted

no
one
has
been
here
these
ten
days
do
not
stay
here
to
torment
yourself

no
one
escaped
but
you

I
was
startled

had
I
spoken
my
thought
aloud

I
turned
and
the
french
window
was
open
behind
me

I
made
a
step
to
it
and
stood
looking
out

and
there
amazed
and
afraid
even
as
I
stood
amazed
and
afraid
were
my
cousin
and
my
wifemy
wife
white
and
tearless

she
gave
a
faint
cry

I
came
she
said

I
knewknew

she
put
her
hand
to
her
throatswayed

I
made
a
step
forward
and
caught
her
in
my
arms



chapter
ten

the
epilogue


I
cannot
but
regret
now
that
I
am
concluding
my
story
how
little
I
am
able
to
contribute
to
the
discussion
of
the
many
debatable
questions
which
are
still
unsettled

in
one
respect
I
shall
certainly
provoke
criticism

my
particular
province
is
speculative
philosophy
my
knowledge
of
comparative
physiology
is
confined
to
a
book
or
two
but
it
seems
to
me
that
carver's
suggestions
as
to
the
reason
of
the
rapid
death
of
the
martians
is
so
probable
as
to
be
regarded
almost
as
a
proven
conclusion

I
have
assumed
that
in
the
body
of
my
narrative

at
any
rate
in
all
the
bodies
of
the
martians
that
were
examined
after
the
war
no
bacteria
except
those
already
known
as
terrestrial
species
were
found

that
they
did
not
bury
any
of
their
dead
and
the
reckless
slaughter
they
perpetrated
point
also
to
an
entire
ignorance
of
the
putrefactive
process

but
probable
as
this
seems
it
is
by
no
means
a
proven
conclusion

neither
is
the
composition
of
the
black
smoke
known
which
the
martians
used
with
such
deadly
effect
and
the
generator
of
the
heatrays
remains
a
puzzle

the
terrible
disasters
at
the
ealing
and
south
kensington
laboratories
have
disinclined
analysts
for
further
investigations
upon
the
latter

spectrum
analysis
of
the
black
powder
points
unmistakably
to
the
presence
of
an
unknown
element
with
a
brilliant
group
of
three
lines
in
the
green
and
it
is
possible
that
it
combines
with
argon
to
form
a
compound
which
acts
at
once
with
deadly
effect
upon
some
constituent
in
the
blood

but
such
unproven
speculations
will
scarcely
be
of
interest
to
the
general
reader
to
whom
this
story
is
addressed

none
of
the
brown
scum
that
drifted
down
the
thames
after
the
destruction
of
shepperton
was
examined
at
the
time
and
now
none
is
forthcoming

the
results
of
an
anatomical
examination
of
the
martians
so
far
as
the
prowling
dogs
had
left
such
an
examination
possible
I
have
already
given

but
everyone
is
familiar
with
the
magnificent
and
almost
complete
specimen
in
spirits
at
the
natural
history
museum
and
the
countless
drawings
that
have
been
made
from
it
and
beyond
that
the
interest
of
their
physiology
and
structure
is
purely
scientific

a
question
of
graver
and
universal
interest
is
the
possibility
of
another
attack
from
the
martians

I
do
not
think
that
nearly
enough
attention
is
being
given
to
this
aspect
of
the
matter

at
present
the
planet
mars
is
in
conjunction
but
with
every
return
to
opposition
I
for
one
anticipate
a
renewal
of
their
adventure

in
any
case
we
should
be
prepared

it
seems
to
me
that
it
should
be
possible
to
define
the
position
of
the
gun
from
which
the
shots
are
discharged
to
keep
a
sustained
watch
upon
this
part
of
the
planet
and
to
anticipate
the
arrival
of
the
next
attack

in
that
case
the
cylinder
might
be
destroyed
with
dynamite
or
artillery
before
it
was
sufficiently
cool
for
the
martians
to
emerge
or
they
might
be
butchered
by
means
of
guns
so
soon
as
the
screw
opened

it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
lost
a
vast
advantage
in
the
failure
of
their
first
surprise

possibly
they
see
it
in
the
same
light

lessing
has
advanced
excellent
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
martians
have
actually
succeeded
in
effecting
a
landing
on
the
planet
venus

seven
months
ago
now
venus
and
mars
were
in
alignment
with
the
sun
that
is
to
say
mars
was
in
opposition
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
observer
on
venus

subsequently
a
peculiar
luminous
and
sinuous
marking
appeared
on
the
unillumined
half
of
the
inner
planet
and
almost
simultaneously
a
faint
dark
mark
of
a
similar
sinuous
character
was
detected
upon
a
photograph
of
the
martian
disk

one
needs
to
see
the
drawings
of
these
appearances
in
order
to
appreciate
fully
their
remarkable
resemblance
in
character

at
any
rate
whether
we
expect
another
invasion
or
not
our
views
of
the
human
future
must
be
greatly
modified
by
these
events

we
have
learned
now
that
we
cannot
regard
this
planet
as
being
fenced
in
and
a
secure
abiding
place
for
man
we
can
never
anticipate
the
unseen
good
or
evil
that
may
come
upon
us
suddenly
out
of
space

it
may
be
that
in
the
larger
design
of
the
universe
this
invasion
from
mars
is
not
without
its
ultimate
benefit
for
men
it
has
robbed
us
of
that
serene
confidence
in
the
future
which
is
the
most
fruitful
source
of
decadence
the
gifts
to
human
science
it
has
brought
are
enormous
and
it
has
done
much
to
promote
the
conception
of
the
commonweal
of
mankind

it
may
be
that
across
the
immensity
of
space
the
martians
have
watched
the
fate
of
these
pioneers
of
theirs
and
learned
their
lesson
and
that
on
the
planet
venus
they
have
found
a
securer
settlement

be
that
as
it
may
for
many
years
yet
there
will
certainly
be
no
relaxation
of
the
eager
scrutiny
of
the
martian
disk
and
those
fiery
darts
of
the
sky
the
shooting
stars
will
bring
with
them
as
they
fall
an
unavoidable
apprehension
to
all
the
sons
of
men

the
broadening
of
men's
views
that
has
resulted
can
scarcely
be
exaggerated

before
the
cylinder
fell
there
was
a
general
persuasion
that
through
all
the
deep
of
space
no
life
existed
beyond
the
petty
surface
of
our
minute
sphere

now
we
see
further

if
the
martians
can
reach
venus
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
thing
is
impossible
for
men
and
when
the
slow
cooling
of
the
sun
makes
this
earth
uninhabitable
as
at
last
it
must
do
it
may
be
that
the
thread
of
life
that
has
begun
here
will
have
streamed
out
and
caught
our
sister
planet
within
its
toils

dim
and
wonderful
is
the
vision
I
have
conjured
up
in
my
mind
of
life
spreading
slowly
from
this
little
seed
bed
of
the
solar
system
throughout
the
inanimate
vastness
of
sidereal
space

but
that
is
a
remote
dream

it
may
be
on
the
other
hand
that
the
destruction
of
the
martians
is
only
a
reprieve

to
them
and
not
to
us
perhaps
is
the
future
ordained

I
must
confess
the
stress
and
danger
of
the
time
have
left
an
abiding
sense
of
doubt
and
insecurity
in
my
mind

I
sit
in
my
study
writing
by
lamplight
and
suddenly
I
see
again
the
healing
valley
below
set
with
writhing
flames
and
feel
the
house
behind
and
about
me
empty
and
desolate

I
go
out
into
the
byfleet
road
and
vehicles
pass
me
a
butcher
boy
in
a
cart
a
cabful
of
visitors
a
workman
on
a
bicycle
children
going
to
school
and
suddenly
they
become
vague
and
unreal
and
I
hurry
again
with
the
artilleryman
through
the
hot
brooding
silence

of
a
night
I
see
the
black
powder
darkening
the
silent
streets
and
the
contorted
bodies
shrouded
in
that
layer
they
rise
upon
me
tattered
and
dogbitten

they
gibber
and
grow
fiercer
paler
uglier
mad
distortions
of
humanity
at
last
and
I
wake
cold
and
wretched
in
the
darkness
of
the
night

I
go
to
london
and
see
the
busy
multitudes
in
fleet
street
and
the
strand
and
it
comes
across
my
mind
that
they
are
but
the
ghosts
of
the
past
haunting
the
streets
that
I
have
seen
silent
and
wretched
going
to
and
fro
phantasms
in
a
dead
city
the
mockery
of
life
in
a
galvanised
body

and
strange
too
it
is
to
stand
on
primrose
hill
as
I
did
but
a
day
before
writing
this
last
chapter
to
see
the
great
province
of
houses
dim
and
blue
through
the
haze
of
the
smoke
and
mist
vanishing
at
last
into
the
vague
lower
sky
to
see
the
people
walking
to
and
fro
among
the
flower
beds
on
the
hill
to
see
the
sightseers
about
the
martian
machine
that
stands
there
still
to
hear
the
tumult
of
playing
children
and
to
recall
the
time
when
I
saw
it
all
bright
and
clearcut
hard
and
silent
under
the
dawn
of
that
last
great
day




and
strangest
of
all
is
it
to
hold
my
wife's
hand
again
and
to
think
that
I
have
counted
her
and
that
she
has
counted
me
among
the
dead
